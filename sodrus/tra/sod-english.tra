@34005 = ~The devil Thel’blax was a scourge against the armies of the Abyss until he was assassinated by the servants of his own master, Dispater. With his final breath, Thel’blax cursed his own body to never lie still even in death. When his body was carried to the Iron Tower, Thel’blax’s horns and barbs continued to thrash about as though alive.

The cursed cornugon’s body was dismantled by his peers, in the hopes that destroying him would end the curse; but the disparate pieces of Thel’blax’s body continued to prick and tear at any who approached. At last, Dispater ordered his ironsmiths to forge the pieces into a suit of armor, intending to use it as a means of torturing insubordinates. Inevitably, the armor fell into the hands of intrepid (if foolhardy) adventurers, who then brought the piece to Faerûn.

Even now, the curse of Thel’blax affects the armor, causing its barbs to sink painfully into the flesh of anyone wearing it. It provides a measure of protection, behaving like hide armor, and even allows the wearer to benefit from Thel’blax’s resilience; but the constant stinging and flaying from the cornugon’s still-living barbs make this armor unsuitable for the faint of heart or the weak of stomach.

Legends and rumors surrounding the source of his power have passed their way across the centuries, but all stories share one vital fact: that in the peak of his power, Elemin's magic proved too powerful for him to control, and he lost his entire family. He created this robe, so the stories claim, from the tears of Mystryl, to stanch his power and protect him from its influence. When he became sick in his later years, Elemin refused to remove the garment in order to let the priests work their magic on him. "I have had enough of this world of magic," he said. "Let me die an ordinary man." And so he did.

At the next lecture, the pupil stood up and shouted, "I won't listen to you any longer!" To his horror, no sound issued from his throat. Ulcaster had twisted the chain of an amulet he wore, which rendered every student in the lecture hall utterly silent. The archmage was unaffected, and so carried on his lecture uninhibited.

When Tip finally died at the age of one hundred and three, he left his favorite belt to his son, who discovered that the belt buckle had caught a four-leaf clover in the clasp. Whether Tip had placed the clover there himself, or whether it had simply been stuck there after a tumble down a hill in his youth, no one will ever know. What is known is that Tip’s fortune passed down to his son, until the belt was stolen from him by an ogre while he was traveling along the Sword Coast.

Finally, a brave old man who had been a fighter in his youth grasped the hilt and claimed the blade as its own. Terrifying beasts sprang at him a moment later, creatures of red mist and fangs and claws. The old man clung to his courage and lay about him with the sword. He grew faster with every monster he killed until finally the clearing was empty. The old man was feasted in the village for days and then set off to live his final years seeking adventure on the road.

Unfortunately—and it took Mosela only a few short days to discover this—Listrom knew more about making the golems than he did about controlling them, and by the end of Mosela’s first week she realized that she would need some means of protecting herself. Thus was created this cudgel that, she hoped, would keep the misbehaving constructs at bay. When Listrom lost what little sanity he had, Mosela discovered that her invention worked just as well on raving lunatics.

Zachiira survived the encounter, but sadly her triumphal return was met with rather less celebration and rather more grief, as the good king was already dead when she arrived.

@34084 = ~SHAMAN: Shamans forge a divine connection with the natural world, similar to the way Druids commune with nature, but Shamans are more spiritual than primal. They directly tap into the energies that flow through the earth and air, through plants and animals, and even through the dead, and shape these energies to obey their will. Nowhere is this more evident than in their ability to summon powerful spirits as guardians and defenders. A being of two worlds, Shamans value balance over dominance.

CLASS FEATURES:

– May only wear leather, studded leather, and hide armor
– May not equip shields larger than bucklers
– May only use the following weapons: dagger, club, spear, axe, quarterstaff, dart, sling, and shortbow
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in any fighting style
– May cast Druid spells
– Does not automatically learn all spells of a given level as Druids do. Instead, Shamans select new spells to learn when they gain levels; once learned, the Shaman can cast them daily without memorization.
– In addition to learning new spells at every level, the Shaman gains immediate access to a number of shaman-specific spells, which can be cast like any other spell in their repertoire: Spirit Ward, Writhing Fog, Spiritual Clarity, Spirit Fire, Recall Spirit, Spiritual Lock, and Ether Gate
– Gains use of the Detect Illusion skill with 20% points as a base, with an additional 4 points per level, up to a maximum of 100% at level 20
– May use Shamanic Dance at will

SHAMANIC DANCE: Shamans can summon spirit allies by performing a ritualistic dance. While dancing, the Shaman takes a -4 penalty to armor class and cannot move, attack, cast spells, use items and special abilities, or perform any other activity. Each round while the Shaman dances, there is a 35% base chance plus 2% for each level of the Shaman that a spirit will answer the call, up to a maximum of 75% at level 20. Any summoned spirits will disappear if the Shaman moves, stops dancing, or if the spirits leave visual range. The spirits grow in power as the Shaman gains additional levels:
  Level 1: Minor animal spirits (snake, fox, hound), up to 2 spirits at the same time
  Level 6: Major animal spirits (bear, panther, boar), up to 3 spirits at the same time
  Level 12: Minor nature spirits (lesser air spirit, lesser earth spirit, lesser fire spirit), up to 4 spirits at the same time
  Level 18: Major nature spirits (air spirit, earth spirit, fire spirit), up to 5 spirits at the same time
The type of the summoned spirit is randomly determined from all the spirits available at the Shaman's level. For example, a level 12 Shaman will summon either a minor nature spirit, a major animal spirit or a minor animal spirit, but cannot choose which one appears. Spirits will do their best to protect the Shaman but are not controlled directly.

– Does not gain bonus spells per day for a high Wisdom
– Alignment restricted to neutral good, true neutral, or neutral evil
– May not dual-class or multi-class
– The Shaman is not eligible for any stronghold. (This affects only the Shadows of Amn campaign in Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition.)

@34085 = ~As a child, your sightings of invisible creatures and spirits greatly concerned your foster father, Gorion.

When Gorion was slain by your half-brother Sarevok Anchev, you left Candlekeep anxious to further strengthen your ties to the ghost realms. Your power grew, as did Sarevok's; the confrontation between you was perhaps inevitable. Gorion was avenged, Sarevok slain at your hand, and you became the hero of Baldur's Gate.

@34248 = ~You may be satisfied to leave Caelar Argent alone. She seems unprepared to do you the same courtesy.~
@34249 = ~A fair point. All right. Start at the beginning. Who is Caelar and what is the purpose of this crusade of hers?~

@34270 = ~We sent a few troops north, but obviously it wasn't enough. And now the crusade dares attack the hero of Baldur's Gate here in the palace. Such audacity! We can no longer afford to stand idle. We must assemble an army to go north.~
@34271 = ~Good thing you have the Flaming Fist at your disposal.~
@34272 = ~Surely a ragtag band of "crusaders" can't be a serious threat? We put them down easily here. ~

@34284 = ~Have a care, <CHARNAME>. We're all on the same side here.~
@34285 = ~The crusaders have disrupted trade all along the Sword Coast. Hundreds have been forced from their homes as the crusade ransacks villages for supplies. The Fist is stretched thin enough already, but we'll have to send everyone we can muster north. ~
@34286 = ~At least at first.~
@34287 = ~She has a disturbing capacity to turn people to her way of thinking. Many of those conscripted to her cause come to believe in it. There are a number of theories as to how she's doing it, but the end result is what matters: Her crusade has made the Coast Way all but impassable.~
@34288 = ~There are a number of theories as to how she's doing it, all of which assume the claims are true—which I'm not prepared to assume. One of the theories is that she's another spawn of Bhaal.~

@34295 = ~They've sent the bulk of the coalition force.~

@34432 = ~Not quite yet. This place looks like it might yet provide some entertainment.~
@34433 = ~Where to next, then? ~
@34434 = ~The Three Old Kegs.~
@34435 = ~The Flaming Fist headquarters. Might as well get it over with...~
@34436 = ~The Iron Throne building, I think.~
@34437 = ~Back to the Ducal Palace. More specifically, back to my bed in the Ducal Palace.~
@34438 = ~Let's go. ~
@34439 = ~Well, when you are ready to go, just say the word.~
@34440 = ~Back to the Palace, then?~
@34441 = ~After we visit the Three Old Kegs.~
@34442 = ~The Flaming Fist dungeon. Might as well get it over with...~
@34443 = ~The Iron Throne building first, I think.~
@34444 = ~And to bed. Yes, yes, yes.~
@34445 = ~No matter what you do,
I will always love you.
It matters not what you say;
You'll never drive me away.
I sing for you this song of love—~
@34446 = ~Bravo! Bravo!~
@34447 = ~Would you like to go someplace private with me, Garrick?~
@34448 = ~Alas, my love belongs to another. I would like to go someplace private, though.~
@34449 = ~(Someplace I could throw up in peace.)~
@34450 = ~Wait—I recognize you, don't I?~
@34451 = ~They're upstairs, I believe. Just follow the shouting, and pray you only interrupt them arguing...~
@34452 = ~Tell me your tale. What brings you here?~
@34453 = ~I come seeking your help, Garrick. I embark on a journey north soon. I want you to join me.~
@34454 = ~You, of course. It's been too long since I heard you sing.~
@34455 = ~I heard good things about a bard that performs there.~
@34456 = ~I'm looking for a pair of rogues, Safana and Coran. I heard they were here?~
@34457 = ~The bard is fabulous. The songs... leave something to be desired.~
@34458 = ~What have you been doing with yourself?~
@34459 = ~I fear it will be longer still. The Elfsong is very particular about who can and cannot sing here, as my love endlessly delights in reminding me.~
@34460 = ~Your singing isn't as bad as all that.~
@34461 = ~Your what now?~
@34462 = ~I head north at first light. Join me and you can sing what you will.~
@34463 = ~You are too kind. But it's not the quality of my voice that keeps me from performing here. It's tradition.~
@34464 = ~You don't know? Of course not, why would you? Well, it is true.~
@34465 = ~But let's not dwell on that. I have good news...~
@34466 = ~I haven't seen you since—well, I don't remember when.~
@34467 = ~Much has changed since then.~
@34468 = ~I remember it well, though there are some things I'd rather forget.~
@34469 = ~I'm not here to reminisce. I leave for the north at first light. I would have you beside me when I do.~
@34470 = ~Let us not dwell upon them. I have good news...~
@34471 = ~For you and me both...~
@34472 = ~I am in love!~
@34473 = ~That's wonderful news!~
@34474 = ~You're joking.~
@34475 = ~Truly? Or is this just bard nonsense?~
@34476 = ~You think so? Perhaps you could have a word with Alyth and try and convince her of it.~
@34477 = ~I can scarcely believe it myself. But it's true.~
@34478 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you. Can I get you something to drink, my <PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@34479 = ~Ah, my dear, I'm glad you're here.~
@34480 = ~Well... MY feelings are as true as any I've ever known.~
@34481 = ~The object of my affections is... not as taken with me as I am with her.~
@34482 = ~Unrequited love. My least favorite kind.~
@34483 = ~I'm shocked.~
@34484 = ~You're a bard living hand to mouth, singing for his nightly supper. Who in their right mind could resist your charms?~
@34485 = ~She'll come around eventually, I'm sure.~
@34486 = ~Her name is Alyth. Ally, I call her. She doesn't like that. She'll come around eventually, I'm sure.~
@34487 = ~I can barely fathom it myself.~
@34488 = ~If there's one matter upon which my mind will never change, it's "Ally." Your insistence that it will is as unappealing as it is inexplicable.~
@34489 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you, my lady. I am <CHARNAME>. And you are?~
@34490 = ~Excuse me?~
@34491 = ~We're having a private conversation.~
@34492 = ~And a terribly important conversation it is, I'm sure. Taking a moment from it to order a drink will surely doom Baldur's Gate, perhaps even the world.~
@34493 = ~<CHARNAME>, this is Ally—I mean Alyth, Lady Alyth Elendara, owner of the Elfsong. She is the girl I spoke of earlier.~
@34494 = ~Any friend of Garrick's is a friend of mine. Pleased to meet you.~
@34495 = ~This is the girl you love, Garrick?~
@34496 = ~I see no girl. This is a woman.~
@34497 = ~And any friend of Garrick's is a welcome distraction from his prattling. Can I get you anything to drink?~
@34498 = ~I could use some wine.~
@34499 = ~I didn't ask you.~
@34500 = ~The woman he lusts after—this week, at least.~
@34501 = ~Thank you for noticing. It seems to be beyond the bard's capacity.~
@34502 = ~I look at you and see naught but the promise of our future together.~
@34503 = ~The promise of an early grave, if you get grabby with me again...~
@34504 = ~You see how she teases me, <CHARNAME>? Is it any wonder I am helpless to resist her?~
@34505 = ~You see how she teases me, <CHARNAME>? Is it any wonder I am helpless to resist her? Wine for my friend and me, my dear. There's a good girl.~
@34506 = ~Gods help me...~
@34507 = ~But you haven't come here simply to catch up. What can I do for you?~
@34508 = ~I need your help, Garrick.~
@34509 = ~Talk me out of a very stupid move I'm about to make. I leave Baldur's Gate in a few hours to head north.~
@34510 = ~I leave Baldur's Gate for the north soon. Join me.~
@34511 = ~Actually, catching up is entirely why I came. And now that I've done so, I'll bid you farewell.~
@34512 = ~Really...? Well, I suppose you do have much to do. Fare thee well, <CHARNAME>. Until we meet again...~
@34513 = ~Fare thee well, <CHARNAME>. Until we meet again...~
@34514 = ~You would journey north? Now?~
@34515 = ~Oh... You couldn't choose a worse time to make such a journey, my friend. You must know of Caelar Argent's so-called crusade.~
@34516 = ~We've yet to meet, but I know Caelar all too well. Agents in her service tried to kill me.~
@34517 = ~I know of it, yes, but not enough. Assassins bearing Caelar's mark tried to cut me down—in the ducal palace, no less.~
@34518 = ~Indeed I do—and I intend to see an end to it. Will you help me?~
@34519 = ~She tried to slay the hero of Baldur's Gate? A bold move, but a risky one. Failure would surely draw you into the conflict...~
@34520 = ~It would seem she judged the risk worth the reward.~
@34521 = ~It has done exactly that. The only question is whether you will join me in this venture.~
@34522 = ~While success would ensure I wasn't. Whatever her reasons, she must pay her actions.~
@34523 = ~Perhaps you'll get to ask her. But I'm afraid you'll have to do so without me. I'm right on the verge of breaking through Alyth's facade of indifference. I cannot leave now. But I wish you well, <CHARNAME>. May you find good fortune in the north.~
@34524 = ~But I'm afraid you'll have to do so without me.~
@34525 = ~I'm right on the verge of breaking through Alyth's facade of indifference.~
@34526 = ~You sure that's just a facade?~
@34527 = ~The bard's not coming, <CHARNAME>. Let's move this along, shall we?~
@34528 = ~I wish you good fortune in your journeys, <CHARNAME>—and look forward to hearing of your adventures when you return.~
@34529 = ~Here, take this sword. It was a gift from an admirer who, er, doesn't admire me quite as much these days. I'm sure you'll have more use for it than I will any time soon. May you find good fortune in the north.~
@34530 = ~I'm sure she will. But I'm afraid you'll have to pay her back without me. I'm on the verge of breaking through Alyth's facade of indifference. I cannot leave now. But I wish you well, <CHARNAME>. May you find good fortune in the north.~
@34531 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. Had you asked me two weeks ago, it would have been a different story.~
@34532 = ~I cannot leave the Elfsong now. I'm right on the verge of breaking through Alyth's facade of indifference. But I wish you well. May you find good fortune in the north.~
@34533 = ~~
@34534 = ~A gold coin. That's all it takes to hear an epic tale from the award-winning balladeer Garrick, of the famous Dale Wind Troubadours.~
@34535 = ~I'm parched. Ally, my darling, fetch me a drink.~
@34536 = ~Fetch it yourself, you useless caterwauler.~
@34537 = ~Sit yourself down and I'll tell you a tale. I'd play you a tune, but it's called the Elfsong for a reason.~
@34538 = ~Head down the hall, and keep on going through the central chamber into the wing opposite this one. Or just follow the ranting. Either one'll get you to the maniac. I'll wait for you here.~
@34539 = ~Talked to your friend? ~
@34540 = ~That's one way to put it.~
@34541 = ~Less "talked" than "got bellowed at by," and I don't know that I'd call him a friend, but all that aside, yes, I did.~
@34542 = ~Yes, but I'd like to poke around here a bit more, if that's all right.~
@34543 = ~Not quite yet.~
@34544 = ~I'm not going to ask. I don't need to ask; I could hear most of it from here. Where to next? ~
@34545 = ~The Three Old Kegs.~
@34546 = ~The Elfsong Tavern. I could use a drink after that.~
@34547 = ~The Iron Throne building, I think.~
@34548 = ~Back to the Ducal Palace. More specifically, back to my bed in the Ducal Palace.~
@34549 = ~You are one odd duck, <CHARNAME>. But suit yourself. Let me know when you're ready to leave.~
@34550 = ~Let's go.~
@34551 = ~Let's go.~
@34552 = ~Let's go.~
@34553 = ~Let's go.~
@34554 = ~Well, what are you waiting for? Get on with it, <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@34555 = ~Yeah, I heard most of it. All right. Where to now?~
@34556 = ~Curse you, Jayvis! Do you know what your cowardice has cost us this day?~ [BD34556]
@34557 = ~The Elfsong Tavern. Suddenly, I could use a drink.~
@34558 = ~The Iron Throne building, I think.~
@34559 = ~The Palace, and to bed.~
@34560 = ~What a delightful fellow. Where to now? ~
@34561 = ~Maybe I'll have better luck with Rasaad. I could scarcely do worse.~
@34562 = ~Tiax's shrieking has my ears ringing. Let's see if Garrick can soothe the pain.~
@34563 = ~I haven't had my fill of insane chatter yet. Where can we find Minsc?~
@34564 = ~Where are Safana and Coran again?~
@34565 = ~I'd like to see how Imoen is doing.~
@34566 = ~The palace. I need to rest.~
@34567 = ~The monk's helping out in a refugee aid camp on the edge of the city. I'll take you there.~
@34568 = ~The Elfsong Tavern it is. Let's go.~
@34569 = ~Our sources put him at the Three Old Kegs Inn, standing guard over the witch Dynaheir. Let's go.~
@34570 = ~Back to the palace, then. Let's go.~
@34571 = ~Good idea. We've a long journey ahead of us.~
@34572 = ~The Elfsong Tavern. Let's go.~
@34573 = ~The Iron Throne building doesn't look the same as the last time you were here, does it? The Council's using it to house refugees fleeing the crusade.~ [BD34573]
@34574 = ~Done what you came to do? ~
@34575 = ~Unfortunately, no. Rasaad won't be joining us. He has... other things on his mind right now.~
@34576 = ~For all the good it did.~
@34577 = ~Yes, but bide a time. I wish to see more of this place.~
@34578 = ~No, not yet.~
@34579 = ~Sometimes things go your way, sometimes they don't. Where to now? ~
@34580 = ~The Three Old Kegs. Perhaps Minsc and Dynaheir will have more to offer us.~
@34581 = ~Let's see what the Elfsong has to offer us.~
@34582 = ~The Flaming Fist gaol. Sublime got me nowhere; time to try absurd.~
@34583 = ~Back to the Ducal Palace. Specifically, back to my bed in the Ducal Palace.~
@34584 = ~Must be a lot of memories here for you. Take your time. If you need me, you know where to find me.~
@34585 = ~Let's go.~
@34586 = ~Hey, take your time. It's not like I have a military caravan to help organize in the next few hours or anything. ~
@34587 = ~What is this...? Is it truly you I see before me?~ [BD34587]
@34588 = ~Well met, Rasaad. It is good to see you again.~
@34589 = ~There's nothing wrong with your eyes, friend. 'Tis I, the one and only, in the flesh, from Candlekeep to Waterdeep, they cheer my name: <CHARNAME>!~
@34590 = ~It is.~
@34591 = ~No, Rasaad. Your eyes do not deceive you—though in a moment, you might wish they had.~
@34592 = ~Yes! There is the wit I have missed these past weeks. How are you, my friend?~ [BD34592]
@34593 = ~Well. And you?~
@34594 = ~Not as bored as I'd like to be.~
@34595 = ~I live. That's more than many can say these days.~
@34596 = ~I was well enough, until a few hours ago. Then assassins in service to Caelar Argent attacked Imoen and me in the Ducal Palace.~
@34597 = ~A grim pronouncement. What troubles you, my friend?~ [BD34597]
@34598 = ~Agents of Caelar Argent tried to kill me and Imoen—in my chamber at the Ducal Palace.~
@34599 = ~The assassins who tried to slay me and Imoen a few hours ago. Though it must be said they trouble me less now than they did then.~
@34600 = ~An impending journey to the north. I need people I can trust by my side. I need you.~
@34601 = ~Ah. This is no social call, then. I gather you mean to take the battle to Caelar herself.~ [BD34601]
@34602 = ~You know there are few things I would not do for you, my friend. But I cannot help you with this.~ [BD34602]
@34603 = ~Is Imoen all right?~ [BD34603]
@34604 = ~She'll live. Which is more than can be said for Caelar. ~
@34605 = ~You mean to take the battle to the Shining Lady, then?~ [BD34605]
@34606 = ~If only I could join you. But I fear I cannot help you with this.~ [BD34606]
@34607 = ~And you, my friend. How have you been?~ [BD34607]
@34608 = ~Well. And you?~
@34609 = ~I was nearly killed earlier this evening. But I wasn't, so all things considered I guess I'm doing well.~
@34610 = ~I yet live. That's all that matters in the end.~
@34611 = ~For better or worse, we live in exciting times.~ [BD34611]
@34612 = ~It is good to see you, my friend. How have you been?~
@34613 = ~Well. And you?~
@34614 = ~Up until this morning, well.~
@34615 = ~I live. Which is more than many can say.~
@34616 = ~A grim perspective. But an understandable one.~ [BD34616]
@34617 = ~What happened this morning?~
@34618 = ~I was attacked.~
@34619 = ~I was served a rotten fig at breakfast. Also, assassins tried to kill me.~
@34620 = ~A handful of killers penetrated the Ducal Palace and attempted to assassinate me. They nearly killed Imoen.~
@34621 = ~Imoen?~
@34622 = ~Rotted figs are disgusting— Wait, what?~
@34623 = ~You have heard of Caelar's crusade, I assume.~
@34624 = ~I was nearly killed this morning.~
@34625 = ~Agents of Caelar penetrated the Ducal Palace. They tried to kill me and Imoen. They might have succeeded.~
@34626 = ~Sad, but true. ~
@34627 = ~I'm not having a good day. ~
@34628 = ~The day's first meal is important. It sets the tone for what is to come— Wait. Are you saying someone tried to kill you?~ [BD34628]
@34629 = ~I still mourn the loss of my brother, Gamaz. Some days are better than others.~ [BD34629]
@34630 = ~I know the pain of losing a family member. I nearly lost my oldest friend just hours ago.~
@34631 = ~Any day you can get to breakfast without assassins trying to kill you is a good day. Or so I've heard.~
@34632 = ~I've something that may take your mind off your loss for a time. A grand adventure to the north.~
@34633 = ~Dire news indeed.~
@34634 = ~Nearly killed, you say?~ [BD34634]
@34635 = ~What happened?~ [BD34635]
@34636 = ~I take it you know of Caelar's crusade?~
@34637 = ~The Shining Lady Caelar happened. Or assassins who bore her mark did, at any rate.~
@34638 = ~A trio of assassins in service to Caelar Argent penetrated the Ducal Palace and attempted to kill me and Imoen.~
@34639 = ~Indeed. This building is filled with those whose lives have been affected by it.~ [BD34639]
@34640 = ~Like them, my life has suffered from her malign influence. Her assassins tried to kill me earlier. They nearly succeeded.~
@34641 = ~Has she sent multiple assassins to kill any of them? Because that's what she did to me.~
@34642 = ~These people have run from their troubles. I intend to face mine. Caelar tried to kill me this morning.~
@34643 = ~You say Caelar tried to kill you? ~
@34644 = ~Assassins bearing her mark did.~
@34645 = ~Not personally, but yes. Six of her men did their damndest to end me.~
@34646 = ~The men she sent tried it. She'll come to regret that soon.~
@34647 = ~She tried to have you killed? ~
@34648 = ~You say Caelar Argent tried to kill you? But why?~ [BD34648]
@34649 = ~I was hoping you'd help me find out.~
@34650 = ~I'm less concerned with her reasons than ensuring this doesn't happen again.~
@34651 = ~Why doesn't matter. All that matters is that she pay for her folly.~
@34652 = ~You walk a dark path, <CHARNAME>. Vengeance will consume you if you let it. Believe me, I know.~ [BD34652]
@34653 = ~That is why I would have you with me. You shall keep me from walking too far into the darkness.~
@34654 = ~Alorgoth remains unpunished.~
@34655 = ~You hope to avenge your brother. I seek to save myself. Different things entirely.~
@34656 = ~That is good. But I don't understand.~ [BD34656]
@34657 = ~I am sure it comforts you to believe that.~ [BD34657]
@34658 = ~Imoen? Will she survive?~ [BD34658]
@34659 = ~Luckily, she will.~
@34660 = ~Oh yes. I'm sure she'll be irritating me thoroughly in very short order.~
@34661 = ~She lives.~
@34662 = ~Who would do such a thing?~ [BD34662]
@34663 = ~The Shining Lady. Caelar Argent.~
@34664 = ~The same woman who drove those you shelter here from their homes.~
@34665 = ~Caelar Argent. Soon I will head north with a Flaming Fist contingent to mete out justice. I want you to join me.~
@34666 = ~You say it is Caelar who tried to kill you?~
@34667 = ~Slow down, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD34667]
@34668 = ~Caelar?~ [BD34668]
@34669 = ~You know there are few things I would not do for you, my friend. But I cannot do this.~ [BD34669]
@34670 = ~While most focus on Caelar's crusade, another, more subtle darkness is spreading. In the past few weeks, many servants of Selûne have vanished.~ [BD34670]
@34671 = ~Even if I could leave the refugees to their fates, I cannot abandon my brothers and sisters, not now.~
@34672 = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD34672]
@34673 = ~There is naught to forgive, my friend. The Selûnites need you. I shall manage.~
@34674 = ~Your company will be missed, Rasaad. Fare thee well. I hope we meet again.~
@34675 = ~Fine. Waste your time with rabble, with sheep and the memories of your brother to keep you company. I don't need you or anyone else to help me deal with the Shining Lady.~
@34676 = ~As do I.~ [BD34676]
@34677 = ~May the Moonmaiden smile upon you in your efforts, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD34677]
@34678 = ~Alorgoth will pay for his sins... someday.~ [BD34678]
@34679 = ~I hope you're right, my friend. It's a heavy burden you bear.~
@34680 = ~And Caelar will pay for what she tried to do. Soon.~
@34681 = ~Well, he's not likely to pay any time soon, with you wasting your time helping these pitiful wretches.~
@34682 = ~I wish I were able to help you, <CHARNAME>. But I cannot do this.~ [BD34682]
@34683 = ~These people are in need. We of the Order are bound to bring light where we may.~ [BD34683]
@34684 = ~A noble effort. But you could spare greater suffering by helping me end Caelar and her crusade.~
@34685 = ~Vengeance would bring light to my life. Help me get it.~
@34686 = ~Your talents are wasted here, Rasaad.~
@34687 = ~Would that I could help you, <CHARNAME>. You know there are few things I would not do for you, my friend. But I cannot do this.~ [BD34687]
@34688 = ~What now? ~
@34689 = ~Now I'll talk to Tiax. Ought to be good for a laugh, if nothing else.~
@34690 = ~The Three Old Kegs Inn. Perhaps I'll have better luck convincing Minsc and Dynaheir to join me.~
@34691 = ~The Elfsong Tavern. I've a sudden urge to drown my sorrows.~
@34692 = ~Back to the Ducal Palace. I want to check on Imoen.~
@34693 = ~Someplace with liquor.~
@34694 = ~I need to rest.~
@34695 = ~I know just the place. Let's go.~
@34696 = ~Back to the Ducal Palace it is, then. Let's go.~
@34697 = ~This should be... something. Let's go.~
@34698 = ~Sounds good to me. Maybe we could have a drink while we're there. I'm parched. Let's go.~
@34699 = ~As you wish. Let's go.~
@34700 = ~Fenster said she could use some rest, but I'm not going to object to heading back to the Palace. Let's go.~
@34701 = ~Finished? I'm ready to head out when you are.~ [BD34701]
@34702 = ~I believe so.~
@34703 = ~I'm finished with those two. But I could use a drink. How about you?~
@34704 = ~Someone tried to kill me tonight and I'm in a bar. Hells no, I'm not finished.~
@34705 = ~Where to next? ~
@34706 = ~The Elfsong Tavern, I believe.~
@34707 = ~Gaol. I want to see Tiax.~
@34708 = ~The Iron Throne building. Rasaad might aid me.~
@34709 = ~Back to the Ducal Palace.~
@34710 = ~I could use a drink. You?~
@34711 = ~I'll follow you out.~
@34712 = ~I... Sure. Why not?~
@34713 = ~That won't be a problem. The less I have to talk to you, the better, as far as I'm concerned. I'll follow you out when you're ready to leave.~
@34714 = ~When you are, you know where to find me. ~
@34715 = ~What is it, Boo? I've never seen you so—~ [BD34715]
@34716 = ~Ah? Can it be? Is this the hero of Baldur's Gate I see?~ [BD34716]
@34717 = ~It is I, Minsc. It's been too long.~
@34718 = ~I wouldn't want to speculate on exactly what you see, Minsc. But yes, I am here. And I need your help.~
@34719 = ~Minsc. I have need of you.~
@34720 = ~And Boo?~ [BD34720]
@34721 = ~Of course.~
@34722 = ~Sure.~
@34723 = ~It seems unavoidable.~
@34724 = ~Boo and I would journey to at least seven of the Hells and back for you, <CHARNAME>. Probably all nine, but Boo says, "Minsc! Be realistic!" This you know.~ [BD34724]
@34725 = ~But we cannot leave our friend Dynaheir undefended.~ [BD34725]
@34726 = ~She is here, then? Excellent, I want to speak with her too.~
@34727 = ~I wouldn't ask you to. I'm hoping she will come too.~
@34728 = ~Dynaheir can take care of herself well enough. But if you'll not join me without her, I guess I'd best speak to her.~
@34729 = ~Then do as the cats do to Boo when they think he is not looking and follow!~ [BD34729]
@34730 = ~Boo's giant shrunken heart thrills to see you again, <CHARNAME>, as does my own.~ [BD34730]
@34731 = ~How are you?~ [BD34731]
@34732 = ~Worse now than I was a day ago. I'm journeying to the north. I was hoping Boo—and you, of course—would join me.~
@34733 = ~I was fine, up until this morning. Now I'm going on a journey. I'd like you to come with me.~
@34734 = ~Fine. I just... forgot what you were like. I'll be going now.~
@34735 = ~Eh? What is that, Boo?~ [BD34735]
@34736 = ~I see, I see.~ [BD34736]
@34737 = ~You are wise as Boo. A young Boo, before he was as wise as he is now. Few are that wise, you understand.~ [BD34737]
@34738 = ~Come, I shall take you to Dynaheir.~ [BD34738]
@34739 = ~THAT's the enthusiasm I remember. You haven't changed, <CHARNAME>, not a bit.~ [BD34739]
@34740 = ~Well, maybe a bit.~ [BD34740]
@34741 = ~A small bit.~ [BD34741]
@34742 = ~It was good to see you again, <CHARNAME>. We will meet again soon, I think. Until then, farewell!~ [BD34742]
@34743 = ~Dynaheir. Someone would like to speak with you.~ [BD34743]
@34744 = ~What dost thou want now, Minsc? I am—~
@34745 = ~How many times must I tell you, Minsc, I'll not debate Boo on the merits of— <CHARNAME>? Is everything all right? Why art thou here?~ [BD34745]
@34746 = ~I need your help, Dynaheir.~
@34747 = ~It's been a while since I heard someone well and truly mangle the common tongue. I missed it.~
@34748 = ~Come morning, I journey north to Dragonspear Castle. I would have you join me.~
@34749 = ~Thou wouldst face the Shining Lady, then?~ [BD34749]
@34750 = ~She tried to kill me. She very nearly killed someone I care deeply for. I can't let that stand.~
@34751 = ~I've little choice in the matter. She sent assassins to try and kill me this morning.~
@34752 = ~I'll do much more than that to her if I have my way.~
@34753 = ~I know of this woman. There are those who believe her to be a daughter of the divine—perhaps even a child of Bhaal... She merits further investigation, and is the reason I still linger in the region.~ [BD34753]
@34754 = ~Thine offer is accepted. Minsc and I will travel north with thee.~ [BD34754]
@34755 = ~And with Boo.~ [BD34755]
@34756 = ~Of course. We would be lost without thy hamster.~ [BD34756]
@34757 = ~Prepare yourself, Boo! We are about to embark on another epic adventure!~ [BD56962]
@34758 = ~You sure you want the ranger along, <CHARNAME>...?~
@34759 = ~Just asking...~
@34760 = ~Where shall we meet?~
@34761 = ~Our allies will gather at the Ducal Palace at dawn. ~
@34762 = ~We shall see thee then, then. Take care. ~
@34763 = ~I know not what thou speakest of. Common words never sound better than when they're 'twixt my lips.~ [BD34763]
@34764 = ~I meant only to say you have a unique way with words, not an unappealing one. Far from it.~
@34765 = ~I wouldn't touch that line with a ten-foot barge pole.~
@34766 = ~Soon I will journey north to Dragonspear Castle. I would have you join me.~
@34767 = ~What dost thou want of me?~ [BD34767]
@34768 = ~Your company. Soon I will journey north. I would have you join me.~
@34769 = ~I need help. I mean, I'm talking to Minsc; OBVIOUSLY, I need help. But more than that, I need people I can trust to join me on a journey to Dragonspear Castle.~
@34770 = ~I no longer know. Forgive me this intrusion, Dynaheir. I'll leave you and Minsc to your affairs now.~
@34771 = ~A journey? ~
@34772 = ~Come morning, I head north with the Flaming Fist. ~
@34773 = ~Caelar the Shining Lady tried to kill me and Imoen. I can't let that stand. ~
@34774 = ~Caelar the Shining Lady... ~
@34775 = ~You! Come here! Tiax commands you! ~
@34776 = ~Well met, Tiax. How are you doing this <DAYNIGHTALL>?~
@34777 = ~Oh, right, you're like THIS. I'll be going now.~
@34778 = ~No one commands me.~
@34779 = ~Tiax commands all! ALL! ~
@34780 = ~It is as you say, Lord.~
@34781 = ~Fine, you command me.~
@34782 = ~No one commands me.~
@34783 = ~We're done here.~
@34784 = ~That's better. What can your lord and master do for you this <DAYNIGHTALL>, peon? ~
@34785 = ~I need your help, Tiax.~
@34786 = ~You know what? I've changed my mind about wanting your help.~
@34787 = ~There is someone in the north who needs killing. Her name is Caelar Argent. Some call her the Shining Lady.~
@34788 = ~You need the help of the great and mighty Tiax? Hah! It is to laugh! Hah! Hah! And hah again! ~
@34789 = ~So you won't help me?~
@34790 = ~You know what I like about you, Tiax? Your sense of humor. So, will you help me?~
@34791 = ~You're utterly mad.~
@34792 = ~You call Tiax mad? MAD?~
@34793 = ~Help you?~
@34794 = ~How is Tiax doing? What sort of question is that for the master of all?~
@34795 = ~I would not want to upset the master of all by being rude.~
@34796 = ~Master of all? You?~
@34797 = ~My time is valuable, madman. I'll waste no more of it on you.~
@34798 = ~I'm done wasting time with this lunatic. Let's go, Bragg.~
@34799 = ~Then you are wise. Perhaps when Tiax takes what is rightfully his, you will be spared. You may go now. ~
@34800 = ~Before I do, I've a boon to ask of you.~
@34801 = ~Yes. I think that would be for the best.~
@34802 = ~Ah-HAH! So NOW we finally get to the point. You want something from Tiax, do you?~
@34803 = ~Ah-HAH! FINALLY <PRO_HESHE> gets to the point. You want something from Tiax! Well, what is it? What can this humble servant of ALMIGHTY CYRIC do for you?~
@34804 = ~I was going to ask you to join me on a journey north.~
@34805 = ~You believe you're humble?~
@34806 = ~Help me kill a woman named Caelar.~
@34807 = ~NONE ARE MORE HUMBLE THAN TIAX! CYRIC HAS DECLARED IT SO! ~
@34808 = ~If you say so. I was hoping you would accompany me on a venture in the north.~
@34809 = ~I'll take your word for it. Out of curiosity, what does Cyric say about the Shining Lady, Caelar Argent?~
@34810 = ~Yeah, we're done here.~
@34811 = ~It's north you want to go, is it? And why would you want to do that, eh? Eh? Eh, eh, eh? ~
@34812 = ~There is a woman named Caelar causing problems. She must be dealt with.~
@34813 = ~You probably haven't noticed here in your cell, but the city's getting crowded right now.~
@34814 = ~There's a woman I must kill—the Shining Lady, Caelar Argent.~
@34815 = ~Have you taken leave of your senses, <CHARNAME>? This is no cell!~
@34816 = ~Caelar, you say? Tiax has heard this name, many times. His court echoes with the name, Caelar... Caelar... CAELAR!~
@34817 = ~What do these voices say?~
@34818 = ~I take it by "court," you actually mean "jail cell."~
@34819 = ~Help me kill Caelar. We will silence these voices together.~
@34820 = ~It's a court! Cyric says it is so! ~
@34821 = ~I don't think he has...~
@34822 = ~One man's court is another's prison. I can free you from this one, if you help me with Caelar.~
@34823 = ~Fine. It's a court. I don't care. Will you help me or not?~
@34824 = ~Tiax knows of the Luminous One. Luminous is a strange word, is it not? Luminous. Lumi-NUSS. Looooooominous.~
@34825 = ~Focus, Tiax. Will you help me deal with Caelar or not?~
@34826 = ~You know what? It actually is kind of an odd one. "Luminous." But it is, at best, beside the point.~
@34827 = ~You're of no use to me, madman.~
@34828 = ~What? You would have Tiax leave his court? ~
@34829 = ~I would have you join me in the north.~
@34830 = ~You mean your jail cell?~
@34831 = ~No. On reflection, I would not.~
@34832 = ~What do the voices say? They say I am Tiax! Master of this world and every other!~
@34833 = ~I am Tiax! TIAX IS LORD OVER ALL HE SURVEYS! Cyric has declared it so! ~
@34834 = ~I don't think he has.~
@34835 = ~Good thing all you can survey is this prison cell.~
@34836 = ~Prove it, then. Join me in killing Caelar.~
@34837 = ~CYRIC HAS DECLARED TIAX LORD OVER ALL! ~
@34838 = ~I'm wasting my time here.~
@34839 = ~All right, all right. You are lord over all.~
@34840 = ~I am the <PRO_SONDAUGHTER> of Bhaal, Cyric-lover. You have no sway over me.~
@34841 = ~They called me mad. They ALL called me mad. Tiax will show them. Tiax will show them all... ~
@34842 = ~Hah! My god slew your god, fool! And then He declared Tiax will be lord of all! ~
@34843 = ~He wasn't my god. He was my father.~
@34844 = ~You're crazier than your god. You know that, right?~
@34845 = ~I should kill you where you stand, you wretched piece of filth.~
@34846 = ~It matters not! He is dead at Cyric's hand! Hahah! ~
@34847 = ~What do you want with Tiax, lord of the land, seas, and sky, Bhaal-bred?~
@34848 = ~I was going to ask you to join me on a journey north.~
@34849 = ~I want him as far away from me as possible.~
@34850 = ~I want you to help me find and eliminate Caelar the Shining Lady.~
@34851 = ~Tiax cannot be killed! Not by you! His life belongs to Cyric. ~
@34852 = ~Life is cheap to the Lord of Murder.~
@34853 = ~Cyric can have it. Let's get out of here.~
@34854 = ~If I had more time, I'd make you beg your wretched god to let you die. Count yourself lucky, madman.~
@34855 = ~You know nothing of Cyric or his ways. Perhaps Tiax will do as you ask—help you kill this Shining Lady in the name of the one true Lord of Murder...~
@34856 = ~Nay! Cyric has given Tiax a vision! You go to your doom, child of Bhaal! Tiax will not join you. He will stay here in his court, where it is safe. Cyric has declared it so!~
@34857 = ~Are you sure?~
@34858 = ~I'd try to change your mind, if I believed you actually possessed one.~
@34859 = ~You are as useless as your god.~
@34860 = ~Tiax has spoken! Begone!~
@34861 = ~FEAR THE DARK SUN!~
@34862 = ~You noticed that, did you?~
@34863 = ~It's about bloody time. ~
@34864 = ~If he doesn't tone it down, his gaolers will take care of that. Let's go.~
@34865 = ~Well, that was time well spent. Let's go.~
@34866 = ~What can I getcha?~
@34867 = ~Wine.~
@34868 = ~Coming right up.~
@34869 = ~Good call.~
@34870 = ~Out! Get out, you vile, poxy snake!~
@34871 = ~Safana, my love, don't BE like this—~
@34872 = ~I rue the day I heard your wretched name, you weasel!~
@34873 = ~I'm a weasel AND a snake? That doesn't make sense.~
@34874 = ~I've got a dagger, you know. Do you think I won't use it? GO! Get out of here! GET OUT OF HERE!~
@34875 = ~GO! Get out of here before I change my mind about not turning you into stew meat for the dogs!~
@34876 = ~But—~
@34877 = ~GET OUT OF HERE!~
@34878 = ~Well, hello there. How does this <DAYNIGHTALL> find you, fair maiden?~
@34879 = ~You don't recognize me, do you, Coran?~
@34880 = ~Well enough, but I could be better. What are you doing for the next several weeks?~
@34881 = ~Keep moving, elf. You want no part of me.~
@34882 = ~Better than it'll find you, if you don't shut your mouth and keep walking.~
@34883 = ~Do I know you?~
@34884 = ~You don't recognize me, Coran?~
@34885 = ~No. Probably best if we keep it that way.~
@34886 = ~Er... No. No, I don't think so.~
@34887 = ~What is this now? Do my eyes deceive me? Could this truly be <CHARNAME> standing before me?~
@34888 = ~It is. I'm glad I ran into you. I need your help.~
@34889 = ~If it isn't, someone's made a terrible mistake. How are you, Coran?~
@34890 = ~Er... No. No, I just look like <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@34891 = ~Better for having seen you. But I must go now—if Safana catches me lingering, she might try to follow through with her threats to cut off certain parts of my body. Parts I'd be MOST reluctant to lose, if you get my meaning. You'll forgive me if I don't tarry.~
@34892 = ~Pieces I'd be MOST reluctant to part with, if you get my meaning.~
@34893 = ~Here, have this gem, I, ah-hah, acquired it from a lovely elven girl—lovely, and so, so quiet. Safana was furious, of course. I should never have taken the damnable thing, but it would've been impolite to refuse, wouldn't it? All right. Take care. Hopefully we'll meet again soon, under brighter circumstances.~
@34894 = ~Truly? The resemblance is amazing... But I've seen stranger things, to be sure. Well, if you'll excuse me, I must be off. Have a good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@34895 = ~Are we one and the same, my sister? One soul in two bodies, born of the Lord of Murder?~ [BD34895]
@34896 = ~I'm of no mind to argue with you, friend. Good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you.~
@34897 = ~Next several weeks? I prefer not to think much beyond the next few hours. I'm afraid I can't help you, friend. No, no, don't start, my mind is made up. I'll not be swayed by tears. Hey—it's all right. I'm sure you'll manage to muddle through without me. Somehow. ~
@34898 = ~And a good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you, dear lady.~
@34899 = ~Really? You bear an amazing resemblance to someone I once knew... No matter. I hope you have a good <DAYNIGHTALL>, stranger—at least better than my own. Farewell.~
@34900 = ~Oh yes, the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate, those unimpeachable founts of all that is truthful and honorable. (And he calls the crusaders mindless!)~ [BD34900]
@34901 = ~Damn you to all Nine Hells, Coran, I swear I'm going to— Oh. Hello.~ [BD34901]
@34902 = ~Greetings. How does this <DAYNIGHTALL> find you, Safana?~
@34903 = ~Hey, Safana. Been a while. You're looking good.~
@34904 = ~How are you on this glorious <DAYNIGHTALL>, milady?~
@34905 = ~It's been less than pleasant thus far, but it's improving by the second. Come in, <CHARNAME>, come in. Make yourself comfortable.~ [BD34905]
@34906 = ~What brings you to my door?~ [BD34906]
@34907 = ~I need your help. I'll be joining a Flaming Fist caravan heading north to face Caelar's crusade on the morrow. We could use a woman of your talents.~
@34908 = ~A desire to see you isn't sufficient?~
@34909 = ~Earlier this night, assassins penetrated the Ducal Palace and attempted to kill me. They were sent by Caelar Argent.~
@34910 = ~Nothing of import. And there are other places I need to be before the <DAYNIGHTALL> ends. Farewell, Safana.~
@34911 = ~"We"? Or "you"?~ [BD34911]
@34912 = ~Me. I would like you to come with us.~
@34913 = ~Which would get you to say yes?~
@34914 = ~We.~
@34915 = ~You're hurting my feelings, <CHARNAME>. But I never could say no to you. Then again, I can't think of a single thing you could ask that would make me want to...~ [BD34915]
@34916 = ~I could never say no to you, <CHARNAME>. Then again, I can't think of a single thing you could ask that would make me want to...~ [BD34916]
@34917 = ~Then again, I can't think of a single thing you could ask that would make me want to...~
@34918 = ~We leave from the Ducal Palace at first light.~
@34919 = ~Don't be late.~
@34920 = ~You know what I always admired about you, <CHARNAME>? Your keen sense of observation. Well, don't just stand there; come in.~ [BD34920]
@34921 = ~Nice try, <CHARNAME>. I've spent the last month with that two-faced elf, Coran. A flattering tongue will get you nowhere. What do you want, really?~ [BD34921]
@34922 = ~I need your help, Safana. A Flaming Fist expedition heads north to face Caelar's crusade on the morrow. I'll be with them. I'd like you to join me. We could use a woman of your talents.~
@34923 = ~You are most perceptive. It's true; I have an ulterior motive in coming here. Several, really, but the one that matters is that we need your help.~
@34924 = ~Your company on a journey north. I go to face the Shining Lady, Caelar Argent.~
@34925 = ~My day is getting better by the second. What's your name, handsome?~ [BD34925]
@34926 = ~Allow me to introduce myself. I am <CHARNAME>.~
@34927 = ~It hasn't been so long since you saw me last, Safana. Surely you remember?~
@34928 = ~Is Coran here?~
@34929 = ~That's true.~
@34930 = ~That vile rake? Why would you even ask that?~ [BD34930]
@34931 = ~No reason. I just thought—well, it doesn't matter. I need your help, Safana. I travel to Dragonspear on the morrow. I could use some company.~
@34932 = ~I could've used his help on a journey I'm about to embark on.~
@34933 = ~So he's not here? I'd best be going then. Enjoy the rest of your night, my lady.~
@34934 = ~<CHARNAME>. I'd heard you were staying at the Ducal Palace. What brings you to my door this day? Feel free to say you're here for me.~ [BD34934]
@34935 = ~Feel free to say you're here for me.~
@34936 = ~I am here for you. Come morning, I embark on a journey north. I could use some company.~
@34937 = ~I did want to see you—one last time. These are dark times. Tomorrow, I leave to face Caelar's crusade.~
@34938 = ~Actually, I was hoping to talk to—what's his name again?—Coran.~
@34939 = ~Ah, no... No, I'm not. And I've much to do ere this <DAYNIGHTALL> ends, so I'd best be about it. Farewell.~
@34940 = ~I'd be delighted.~
@34941 = ~But what are you doing BEFORE morning comes?~
@34942 = ~I'm afraid I've much to take care of this <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@34943 = ~Looking for others to join me going north.~
@34944 = ~Whatever it is will be dreadfully boring, I'm afraid. Nothing you want to waste your time on. Meet us in front of the Ducal Palace at dawn.~
@34945 = ~You could take care of me...~
@34946 = ~Fine. Go. I'll find some way to entertain myself.~
@34947 = ~I've no doubt of that. We'll meet you in front of the Ducal Palace at first light.~
@34948 = ~Meet us in front of the Ducal Palace at dawn. I'll entertain you as much as possible once we're on the road, Safana. I promise.~
@34949 = ~I imagine you will. Meet us at the Ducal Palace at sunrise.~
@34950 = ~You better, <CHARNAME>. If there's one thing I simply cannot tolerate, it's boredom.~
@34951 = ~I'll see you soon.~
@34952 = ~You defeated Sarevok! Ended the iron crisis! And now... this! I've ne'er seen such heroism.~
@34953 = ~You'll not have to do this alone, <CHARNAME>. When do we leave?~
@34954 = ~This doesn't have anything to do with Coran, does it, Safana? I need to know you're doing this for the right reasons.~
@34955 = ~You're really that anxious to get away from Coran?~
@34956 = ~At dawn, from the Ducal Palace. Don't be late.~
@34957 = ~You try living with him. You know when he takes his mask off?~
@34958 = ~NEVER, that's when. When do we leave?~
@34959 = ~At dawn, from the Ducal Palace.~
@34960 = ~I'll see you there.~
@34961 = ~I do nothing on that wretched elf's behalf, you hear me? Nothing!~
@34962 = ~When do we leave?~
@34963 = ~Who?~ [BD34963]
@34964 = ~Caelar Argent. She's responsible for the rising tide of people flowing into the city. We're going to fight her. We'd like your help.~
@34965 = ~You know what? Never mind. I'll deal with this on my own.~
@34966 = ~Oh, don't leave like that, <CHARNAME>. But please, do leave.~ [BD34966]
@34967 = ~But please, do leave.~
@34968 = ~You.~
@34969 = ~Fine. Then I would like you to join us. Please. I need your help.~
@34970 = ~Don't be so anxious to leave, <CHARNAME>. I've some time to spare. I can think of worse people to spend it with than you.~ [BD34970]
@34971 = ~I'd like nothing more, dear lady. But if it's to happen, it cannot happen here. I go to face the Shining Lady Caelar on the morrow. You could join me...~
@34972 = ~That's all right. I've already had a rash. Farewell, Safana.~
@34973 = ~I don't think so.~
@34974 = ~Have a good night. But not as good a night as you could have had, had you bided here a time...~
@34975 = ~Well, I'll not beg for your company. Have a good day. Not as good as the one you MIGHT have had, but a tolerable one. Yes. Have an acceptable day. Farewell.~ [BD34975]
@34976 = ~I never could refuse you, <CHARNAME>. What do you need?~
@34977 = ~Come morning, I join a contingent of Flaming Fist mercenaries on a journey north to confront Caelar the Shining Lady.~
@34978 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate? This is a surprise. I'd heard you were staying at the Ducal Palace. I'm Safana. What brings you to my door this day?~ [BD34978]
@34979 = ~I seek company on a journey north to face the Shining Lady, Caelar Argent.~
@34980 = ~A poor sense of direction. Enjoy your <DAYNIGHTALL>, milady.~
@34981 = ~I really can't recall. I should go.~
@34982 = ~I shall. And if you decide you'd like to enjoy it with me, don't hesitate to call.~ [BD34982]
@34983 = ~Would that I could. But I've many matters to attend to before the night is done. Farewell.~
@34984 = ~I'm afraid you're... really not my type.~
@34985 = ~Let's not, and furthermore, let's make it absolutely clear to everyone we know that we never did.~
@34986 = ~Oh? Oh. OH. ~
@34987 = ~Well then, I suppose you should be on your way. Good night.~
@34988 = ~Forget that lecherous pig, <CHARNAME>. I'm the woman you need.~ [BD34988]
@34989 = ~Then join me.~
@34990 = ~You would abandon your life here and journey north with us to face Caelar?~
@34991 = ~I don't think so.~
@34992 = ~I'm sure of it.~
@34993 = ~Excellent. We leave from the Ducal Palace at dawn.~
@34994 = ~I am Safana. And you are?~
@34995 = ~<CHARNAME>.~
@34996 = ~I am Safana. I'll see you at dawn.~
@34997 = ~That vile rake? Why would you even ask that?~
@34998 = ~I could've used his help on a journey I'm about to embark on.~
@34999 = ~So he's not here? Then I guess I'd best move on.~
@35000 = ~His rakishness notwithstanding, he was a competent thief.~
@35001 = ~Forget that lecherous pig. I'll help you.~
@35002 = ~You will? But we hardly know each other. I'm not even sure of your name.~
@35003 = ~Beggars can't be choosers. Welcome aboard. We depart the Ducal Palace at dawn. Er, what was your name again?~
@35004 = ~I appreciate the thought—well, parts of the thought, anyway—but I think I'll manage on my own. Farewell.~
@35005 = ~I am Safana. I'm more than capable of fulfilling any role that malodorous elf could.~
@35006 = ~This is all about Coran for you, isn't it?~
@35007 = ~I kind of doubt that.~
@35008 = ~I didn't think he smelled that bad.~
@35009 = ~And if it is?~
@35010 = ~I don't need people who aren't in this for the right reasons. Farewell.~
@35011 = ~Revenge is a powerful motivator. Welcome aboard. We leave from the Ducal Palace at dawn.~
@35012 = ~The all-consuming nature of your utter loathing delights me. We leave at dawn from the Ducal Palace.~
@35013 = ~You're as worthless as that wretched elf. Go! Get out, get out now! I'm sick of looking at you! GO!~ [BD35013]
@35014 = ~GO!~
@35015 = ~A competent thief? Him?! Ha! Forget that lecherous pig!~
@35016 = ~Damn you to all Nine Hells, Coran! I swear I'm going to— I'm sorry, who are you?~ [BD35016]
@35017 = ~Greetings, Safana.~
@35018 = ~You don't remember? Are you trying to hurt my feelings?~
@35019 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. You know of me?~
@35020 = ~No one of import, I assure you.~
@35021 = ~<CHARNAME>. What brings you here at this ungodly hour?~ [BD35021]
@35022 = ~You do. I'm joining an expedition heading north to face Caelar's crusade. We could use a woman of your talents.~
@35023 = ~Earlier this night, assassins penetrated the Ducal Palace and attempted to kill me. They were sent by Caelar.~
@35024 = ~A passing fancy. There are other places I need to be while the hour remains ungodly. Farewell.~
@35025 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate is here? Well, that's... interesting. Safana is my name. What brings you to the Elfsong at this ungodly hour?~ [BD35025]
@35026 = ~I seek adventurers to join me in a journey north to face Caelar the Shining Lady.~
@35027 = ~A poor sense of direction. I bid you good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@35028 = ~I really can't recall. I should go.~
@35029 = ~Who?~ [BD34963]
@35030 = ~Caelar Argent. The Shining Lady. The woman responsible for the rising tide of people flowing into the city. We're going to fight her.~
@35031 = ~And with that, we establish that you're not someone I want beside me on this quest. Farewell.~
@35032 = ~You think I'd work with the likes of you? You flatter yourself, dear. You should go now.~ [BD35032]
@35033 = ~I think you should go now.~
@35034 = ~Oh, that's why things have been so damnably crowded lately. Interesting.~ [BD35034]
@35035 = ~Interesting in the worst sense of the word. Caelar has to be stopped.~
@35036 = ~The dukes are worried. The Flaming Fist and I will head north soon. We could use someone of your talents.~
@35037 = ~You haven't a single thought in your head, do you?~
@35038 = ~Good luck with that.~ [BD35038]
@35039 = ~You've no interest in helping? Very well. Do you know where I can find the elf Coran?~
@35040 = ~I think Tymora tends to smile upon those who travel with you. Would you consider joining me?~
@35041 = ~Thank you. Goodbye.~
@35042 = ~You can't seriously be considering taking that vile lech with you. Forget him. If you're that desperate, I'll join you.~ [BD35042]
@35043 = ~Very well. Gather your things and join me.~
@35044 = ~I appreciate the offer, but I'm not that desperate. Nor will I ever be that desperate.~
@35045 = ~Why not? I've heard he's quite charming, in his own way.~
@35046 = ~You'll need even more help if you take that vile rake into your company.~
@35047 = ~Forget him. If you're that desperate, I'll help you.~
@35048 = ~I weary of Baldur's Gate. Some time on the road away from... the city... will do me good.~
@35049 = ~We leave from the Ducal Palace at dawn.~
@35050 = ~We can't leave soon enough as far as I'm concerned. Let's be away from here before that wretched libertine and his rodent face appear again.~ [BD35050]
@35051 = ~Understood.~
@35052 = ~Good. Until the morn, then.~
@35053 = ~And to you.~
@35054 = ~I imagine you could. Hmmm... A break from the city—and a certain inhabitant with pointed ears and a green mask—would be welcome. And my adventures with you have certainly been rewarding... Very well. I shall join you.~ [BD35054]
@35055 = ~And you heard that Safana is good company. Hm. A break from the city—from a certain irritating, elven, mask-wearing inhabitant, at least—would be welcome. Very well. I'm with you.~ [BD35055]
@35056 = ~Very well. I'm with you. When do we leave?~
@35057 = ~At dawn, from the Ducal Palace.~
@35058 = ~Take care, <CHARNAME>. These are dangerous times for a woman alone in Baldur's Gate. Even one as prominent and powerful as you—perhaps more so for one like you. People love you now, but there's a fine line 'twixt love and hate. Believe me.~ [BD35058]
@35059 = ~People love you now, but there's a fine line 'twixt love and hate. Believe me.~
@35060 = ~Farewell.~ [BD35060]
@35061 = ~Rude. And we were getting along so well until that. You should go now, before I do something one of us will regret to your face.~ [BD35061]
@35062 = ~Then begone with you.~ [BD35062]
@35063 = ~You would have me accompany you? I see the benefit for you. For me, not so much. But...~ [BD35063]
@35064 = ~But...~
@35065 = ~A break from the city—and a certain inhabitant, at least—would be welcome. And most likely rewarding, if not a little perilous... Very well. I'm with you.~ [BD35065]
@35066 = ~Who told you that? What wagging tongue spilled such patent lies? Tell me and I'll cut it from its skull!~
@35067 = ~Forget Coran.~
@35068 = ~<CHARNAME>.~
@35069 = ~Ghost Bear~
@35070 = ~So. <CHARNAME>. The <PRO_MANWOMAN>. The myth. The hero of Baldur's Gate. Tell me about yourself.~ [BD35070]
@35071 = ~I'd rather know about you.~
@35072 = ~Gods, we don't have nearly enough time for that. Forget me. Tell me about Caelar.~
@35073 = ~Everything you've heard about me? Absolutely true.~
@35074 = ~I don't talk about my past. Certainly not with strangers.~
@35075 = ~What would you like to know?~ [BD35075]
@35076 = ~How did you come to join the Flaming Fist?~
@35077 = ~What's your sense of this Caelar Argent?~
@35078 = ~Where you're planning to sleep tonight.~
@35079 = ~Sleeping isn't on my agenda. Once I'm finished with you, I'll be spending what time I've got left preparing for the journey north.~ [BD35079]
@35080 = ~There's much to do before we leave. Tell me, what are your thoughts on Caelar?~
@35081 = ~You and the rest of the Flaming Fist. Tell me, how did you come to join Duke Eltan's army?~
@35082 = ~If you need a break from the drudgery, you're welcome to come and not sleep in my chambers, if you know what I mean...~
@35083 = ~Let's not waste more time than necessary here, then.~
@35084 = ~It's best relationships in the Flaming Fist remain professional.~ [BD35084]
@35085 = ~Indeed. So what do you make of Caelar?~
@35086 = ~If you insist. How did you come to join the Fist, anyway?~
@35087 = ~I'm not in the Fist. But I take your meaning—we'd best call it a night.~
@35088 = ~No. You aren't. Drink up. We've things to do and precious little time in which to do them.~ [BD35088]
@35089 = ~Ah, well, there's a tale.~
@35090 = ~Ah, well, therein lies a tale, but it's a long one. My father, Audamar, was a Fist. You could say I followed in his footsteps.~ [BD35090]
@35091 = ~Many children emulate their parents. Not me, thankfully. Say, what are your thoughts on Caelar?~
@35092 = ~That's a curious way of putting things. You obviously followed in his footsteps since you enlisted.~
@35093 = ~As you wish.~
@35094 = ~I did, eventually. But it took me a long time to recognize the value in my father's example. When I was younger, I ran a bit wild. It took a lot of strength and patience on my father's part to set me on the right path. Things would have been much different for me if he were a lesser man.~ [BD35094]
@35095 = ~Let's keep things professional—for now, at least. Drink up. We've things to do and precious little time in which to do them.~ [BD35095]
@35096 = ~Too much. But that's the way of things in this world. Drink up. We've things to do and precious little time in which to do them.~
@35097 = ~Drink up. We've things to do and not much time to do them in.~ [BD35097]
@35098 = ~Too much, but that's always the way of things. Drink up. We should go soon.~
@35099 = ~A charismatic leader. An acolyte of the Order of the Aster, once. She claims divine favor for herself and her forces—that's why so many flock to her banner. She'll be a formidable opponent.~ [BD35099]
@35100 = ~A battle isn't inevitable.~
@35101 = ~That she will. But why? What is she hoping to accomplish?~
@35102 = ~You think this battle is unavoidable?~
@35103 = ~A charismatic leader. A paladin of the Order of the Aster, once, she claims divine protection both for herself and her forces. It's why so many flock to her banner now.~
@35104 = ~She seems pretty determined to make it inevitable.~ [BD35104]
@35105 = ~What is she trying to accomplish?~
@35106 = ~Unfortunate, if true.~
@35107 = ~And a glorious battle it will be.~
@35108 = ~She's been vague on that point. Some claim she plans to restore the dead of the Dragonspear Wars, which is madness on the face of it...~
@35109 = ~We'll find out soon enough, I suspect, but what she wants is of little consequence. It's what she actually does that matters.~ [BD35109]
@35110 = ~For every new crusader that flocks to her banner, there's another that's had their food stolen and been driven from their land. It can't go on like this. The city can't take it. Daggerford definitely can't take it and Waterdeep won't stand for it.~
@35111 = ~It can't go on like this. The city can't take it. Daggerford definitely can't take it and Waterdeep won't stand for it.~
@35112 = ~Whether the battle's long or short, glorious or horrific, it's going to happen. Caelar's got to be stopped. She's driving people out of their homes, seizing their goods, forcing innocents into service... We can't let it go on.~ [BD35112]
@35113 = ~We won't. I can promise you that.~
@35114 = ~We won't. With the combined forces of Waterdeep, Daggerford, and Baldur's Gate, victory is assured. So how did you come to join the Flaming Fist anyway?~
@35115 = ~Don't sound so enthused, <CHARNAME>.~
@35116 = ~The scars I got facing Sarevok have yet to heal. You'll forgive me my reluctance to charge into the fray once more.~
@35117 = ~I've had more than my fill of battle, this past year. I was looking forward to a little peace, for a change.~
@35118 = ~Don't tell me what to do, Captain.~
@35119 = ~That's fair enough, I guess. But the crusade does have to be stopped.~
@35120 = ~The road can be a peaceful place. It's what's at the end of it that's problematic.~
@35121 = ~Huh. Someone woke up on the wrong side of the assassination this <DAYNIGHTALL>...~
@35122 = ~You seem enthused by the prospect.~
@35123 = ~I'll take no joy from doing what must be done. But I will do it.~
@35124 = ~She did try to have me killed.~
@35125 = ~Few things satisfy as much as laying a worthy foe low.~
@35126 = ~Fair enough. Drink up. We've things to do and precious little time in which to do them.~
@35127 = ~I find the idea less appetizing than you. Drink up. We've things to do and precious little time in which to do them.~
@35128 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate is anxious about Caelar? You surprise me, <CHARNAME>.~
@35129 = ~I'll take no joy from doing what must be done. But I will do it.~
@35130 = ~The scars I got facing Sarevok haven't begun to heal yet. You'll forgive me if I'm not excited about charging into battle yet again.~
@35131 = ~I've had more than my fill of battle this past year. I was looking forward to a little peace for a change.~
@35132 = ~Can't ask more than that.~
@35133 = ~Heh. Drink up. We've things to do and precious little time in which to do them.~
@35134 = ~ALL of it? Impressive...~ [BD35134]
@35135 = ~Well, maybe not all of it.~
@35136 = ~You have no idea. Now tell me what you know about Caelar.~
@35137 = ~I'll leave you with that thought, Captain Corwin. We should turn in for the night.~
@35138 = ~Perhaps I'll find out some time. Drink up. We've things to do and precious little time in which to do them.~
@35139 = ~You don't seem so frightening to me.~
@35140 = ~I'm glad to hear it.~
@35141 = ~You don't know me that well. Give it time.~
@35142 = ~That may change.~
@35143 = ~Don't let it go to your head. I'm not renowned for my sound judgment. Drink up. We've things to do and precious little time in which to do them.~
@35144 = ~Is that meant to intimidate me, or entice me?~
@35145 = ~If I intended what I said to impress you in any way, it would be with my honesty, and nothing more.~
@35146 = ~Do you like bad <PRO_GIRLBOY>s?~
@35147 = ~Take your pick.~
@35148 = ~Some part of me must, I suppose. Gods know I surrounded myself with them when I was younger. Things were easier then, when I had only myself to worry about.~
@35149 = ~Things were easier then, when I had only myself to worry about.~
@35150 = ~All right, I will.~
@35151 = ~I see. You're right. Best to keep things 'twixt us as professional as possible. Drink up. We've things to do and precious little time in which to do them.~
@35152 = ~You're right. Best to keep things 'twixt us as professional as possible.~
@35153 = ~And modest too.~ [BD35153]
@35154 = ~That surprises you?~
@35155 = ~I've found other peoples' low expectations of me generally work to my advantage.~
@35156 = ~Not modest. Merely realistic.~
@35157 = ~This must be a tough time for you, then.~ [BD35157]
@35158 = ~Oh, come now.~
@35159 = ~A little.~ [BD35159]
@35160 = ~But not yours, it seems. That's good. We'll need level heads when it comes time to face the crusade.~
@35161 = ~After the iron crisis, the city adores you. When I told my daughter I might meet the hero of Baldur's Gate, she nearly fainted. That kind of deference would go to some peoples' heads. But not yours, it seems. That's good. We'll need level heads when it comes time to face the crusade.~ [BD35161]
@35162 = ~Do you truly think yourself so horrible, <CHARNAME>?~
@35163 = ~We've a long journey together ahead of us. I doubt we'll be strangers long. But it doesn't look like we're going to be friends, either. Nothing wrong with that. Probably best to keep things professional. Drink up and we'll go.~ [BD35163]
@35164 = ~Nothing wrong with that. Probably best to keep things professional. Drink up and we'll go.~
@35165 = ~Not really. Once I'm finished with you, I'll be spending what time there's left before we leave preparing for the journey north.~
@35166 = ~Are you always this direct?~
@35167 = ~When I see something I want, I move quickly.~
@35168 = ~When there's something worth being direct about.~
@35169 = ~Always.~
@35170 = ~Yes. I noticed.~
@35171 = ~You need to work on your flattery, <CHARNAME>.~
@35172 = ~And this works for you, does it?~
@35173 = ~Never mind, I don't think I want to know.~
@35174 = ~Caelar the Shining Lady...~
@35175 = ~Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, <CHARNAME>. Hey.~ [BD35175]
@35176 = ~Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.~ [BD35176]
@35177 = ~Are you awake?~ [BD35177]
@35178 = ~I am now, Skie.~
@35179 = ~Who are you? You'd best have a good reason for waking me.~
@35180 = ~Regrettably.~
@35181 = ~What are you doing here? Never mind. Go do it elsewhere. NOW.~
@35182 = ~If you're here to kill me, you're doing it wrong. If you're here to irritate me, congratulations are in order for a job well done.~
@35183 = ~Don't you want to hear what I have to say?~ [BD35183]
@35184 = ~Do I have a choice?~
@35185 = ~I'm sure that somehow, some way, I will manage to survive, blissful in my ignorance.~

@35188 = ~You remember me, right?~
@35189 = ~Of course I remember you, Skie.~
@35190 = ~I'm afraid I don't.~

@35193 = ~I'm not sure I'd call it fun.~
@35194 = ~Do you actually know what fun is?~
@35195 = ~Eldoth had some fun, I'm sure of that much.~
@35196 = ~Eldoth didn't. He left me, you know.~

@35206 = ~I've joined the Flaming Fist!~ [BD35206]
@35207 = ~Your father allowed that?~
@35208 = ~You say that like it's an accomplishment.~
@35209 = ~No, you haven't.~
@35210 = ~Get out.~
@35211 = ~No, listen, I really have. I used a false name—Daddy would never allow me to enlist—but I'm in. I'll be marching north with you tomorrow!~ [BD35211]
@35212 = ~You misunderstand. When I said get out, I didn't mean "I don't believe you." I meant "GET. OUT."~
@35213 = ~No, really, I have. Not under my name, of course—Daddy would never allow it. But I'm in it now.~ [BD35213]
@35214 = ~Life as a noble is boring and stupid. I want to do something GREAT with my life and also get out of this dirty old city and maybe meet some handsome soldiers. So I'm going north with you!~ [BD35214]

@35216 = ~Well, that's... something.~
@35217 = ~Get out of here. Now.~

@35219 = ~Remember, whatever you do—don't tell Daddy about this!~ [BD35219]
@35220 = ~Not everyone is Duke Silvershield's only child. I had to use a false name, of course. Daddy would never allow me to enlist so it's our secret, all right?~ [BD35220]

@35230 = ~Oh. You're THAT Skie Silvershield.~
@35231 = ~If I say I remember you, will you shut your mouth a moment?~

@35269 = ~I am not well pleased by the situation, I assure you. But Skie is a willful girl. Were I to prevent her joining the Fist, she would find another way to challenge me—perhaps putting herself in even greater danger. As it stands, I can arrange for her protection while not APPEARING to protect her.~ [BD35269]
@35270 = ~Though I like it not, it is my hope this will prove a learning experience for her—that service to the Flaming Fist will strengthen her body, mind, and character. Perhaps Captain Corwin might serve as a role model for her.~ [BD35270]

@35272 = ~Your optimism in this matter baffles me.~

@35274 = ~Then there is nothing more to say.~

@35296 = ~Her complaints will fall on deaf ears. My orders are clear: She is to be treated as any other member of the Fist. I love my Skie, but I have overindulged her. It is a hard world, and it is past time she learned that.~ [BD35296]

Level: 2
Sphere: Summoning
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell conjures a cloud of writhing fog that chills and hinders anyone within its area other than the caster. Creatures in the fog take 1d3 points of cold damage per round. In addition, there is a 20% chance that they must save vs. Death or be slowed for 1 round. Creatures immune to cold damage do not suffer any adverse effects from this spell.~

Level: 6
Sphere: Wards
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates

The target of Spiritual Lock must Save vs. Spell with a -2 penalty or have its mind temporarily sealed away within the spirit world. During this time, the victim is unable to perform any actions that require conscious thought such as attacking, using items, or casting spells. Spirits, fey creatures, elementals, and spectral undead Save vs. Spell with a -4 penalty instead of -2. Spiritual Lock is blocked by spells and abilities that protect against feeblemind effects.~

Level: 4
Sphere: Summoning
Range: 40 ft. 
Duration: Instant 
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius 
Saving Throw: Special

As the Shaman casts this spell, energies gather together from the spirit world and form a pale blue sphere. The Shaman can throw the sphere so that it explodes into a burst of ghostly, azure flames, which deliver 1d4 points of magic damage per level of the Shaman (up to a maximum of 10d4). There is also a 33% chance that every enemy within the area of effect will be afflicted by the Doom spell (-2 penalty to Saving Throws and attack rolls for 1 turn). A successful Save vs. Spell halves the damage and negates the Doom effect. Spirits, fey creatures, elementals, and spectral undead take double damage.~

(Alteration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Travelers
Range: Touch 
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell transports one creature, chosen by the caster, to the Ethereal Plane. The creature vanishes for the spell's duration, at which point it returns to the physical world in the exact same spot where it was before. While in the Ethereal Plane, the victim cannot interact with anyone or anything that resides on the Prime Material Plane. There is no saving throw against this spell, though it is subject to magic resistance. Friendly creatures can lower their magic resistance so that the shaman can target them with this spell. In addition, Ether Gate is blocked by spells and abilities that protect against maze effects.~
@35364 = ~Spirit Form~
@35365 = ~Spirit Form

Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

The shaman slips into a space between the spirit world and the material plane, rendering them partially incorporeal. For the next 5 rounds, all physical attacks directed against the shaman deal 50% of their normal damage. During this time, the shaman is also under the effects of Improved Invisibility and cannot be directly targeted by spells.~

@35519 = ~They must have been strange circumstances indeed. You deserve a better pairing.~

@35544 = ~Alas, I have agreed to serve at the pleasure of Corporal Duncan. However, I should be happy to look after any of your companions with goodly hearts. Should you dismiss them from your service and later require them, you will find them near me. Best of luck, hero.~

@35563 = ~HEAR ME, people of Baldur's Gate! I know you suffered at Sarevok's hands! I know you fear what the future holds, with the heretic Caelar driving good people from their homes across the Sword Coast. I hear your cries for justice, and I swear to you, I shall end this threat to us all!~
@35564 = ~You're probably right.~
@35565 = ~HEAR ME, people of Baldur's Gate! I AM a Bhaalspawn, like my half-brother Sarevok before me. And I am your only shield against what comes, your only sword. Only one with the divine coursing through their veins could hope to thwart the child of a god, and only one can end the threat of Caelar Argent! Now stand aside, lest you feel my wrath!~

@35575 = ~There is truth in that, I suppose. And you promise a better fate than Caelar does.~
@35576 = ~This lot may cower now, but tread carefully. Fear makes people unpredictable, and unpredictable people are dangerous.~
@35577 = ~Do us both a favor—try not to have any more good ideas, all right?~
@35578 = ~Out of the way, you curs! Out of the way! ~
@35579 = ~Boo! Boooo! ~
@35580 = ~That's right! Ride on out of town, y'filthy Bhaal-lickers. And DON'T EVER COME BACK! ~

@35582 = ~Fall back! Fall back! ~
@35583 = ~Camp's set up. ~
@35584 = ~Good. I'd like to explore the area, make sure we don't have any unpleasant surprises. ~
@35585 = ~What now? ~
@35586 = ~The camp's a waste of time. We should ride till we reach Bridgefort. ~
@35587 = ~Wandering off on your own? I don't like it. We already know Caelar's got a target on your back. ~
@35588 = ~I won't be alone. I'll have you with me. ~
@35589 = ~I won't be alone. ~
@35590 = ~You don't like it? Come with me, then. ~

@35598 = ~You've lived with worse. ~
@35599 = ~Deal with it. I don't answer to you. ~
@35600 = ~You better be. Eltan'll have my head if anything untoward happens to you. ~

@35602 = ~Yeah, I'm getting that.~
@35603 = ~That, I like. ~
@35604 = ~We rest, then move on to the bridge. ~
@35605 = ~I'm not feeling particularly restful. Perhaps I'll explore the area. ~
@35606 = ~I'll go mad if I'm stuck sitting in this camp. There must be something I can do. ~
@35607 = ~Time spent here is time wasted. We should move on through the night. ~
@35608 = ~I've got men gathering firewood, and the less time spent away from camp, the safer everyone will be. ~
@35609 = ~Maybe I will just go rest... ~
@35610 = ~Get firewood! Yes! I can do that! ~
@35611 = ~You're joking, yes? A <PRO_MANWOMAN> of my talents, collecting kindling? No. I'll go explore the area, make sure we don't have any unpleasant surprises. ~
@35612 = ~These people have traveled three solid days without a break. If this keeps up, they'll be dead before they ever get close to Caelar.~
@35613 = ~Look, if you absolutely have to do something, I've got people gathering firewood, and the less time spent away from camp, the safer everyone will be. ~

@35618 = ~You said you were going to rest, <CHARNAME>.~
@35619 = ~I can't. I need to move, to do something. ~
@35620 = ~Yeah. I kind of lied about that. Sorry. ~

@35632 = ~That's it. We're heading back to camp. Let's go. ~
@35633 = ~Good call. We don't want to engage the crusade without all our forces behind us. ~
@35634 = ~Don't be so hasty. I want to see what they're up to. ~
@35635 = ~Yes. After we destroy this blockade. ~
@35636 = ~Now! Take them! ~
@35637 = ~Hold the line! ~

@35643 = ~You really don't want to know.~
@35644 = ~The champion of Baldur's Gate. And woe betide any who stand in my way. ~

@35659 = ~You heard her! Fall back! Back, across the bridge! ~
@35660 = ~Identify yourself!~
@35661 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. By what right do you bar passage along the Trade Way?~
@35662 = ~You really don't want to know. ~
@35663 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate. And if you block my passage, grim tidings await. ~
@35664 = ~The hero—? But you're not supposed— Oh, gods!~
@35665 = ~Take <PRO_HIMHER>! ~
@35666 = ~We can't stand against <PRO_HIMHER>! Fall back! ~
@35667 = ~If you're not here to pledge your support to the crusade, begone. ~

@35678 = ~That's not going to happen. ~
@35679 = ~I'll put you in the ground, you mindless parakeet! ~
@35680 = ~This—this is a terrible way to treat a bridge. Or any river crossing! ~
@35681 = ~Wow. Did you see that? That—that was something, don't you think? ~
@35682 = ~Damn it! What in the Nine Hells is going on here?~
@35683 = ~I always have enjoyed a good fireworks display. ~
@35684 = ~It appears this adventure ends with an explosive adjournment.~ [BD35684]
@35685 = ~Why'd they do that? Stupid.~
@35686 = ~Run, cowards! Block my path, but know this is but a temporary setback! I will have my revenge!~

@35691 = ~I don't want to do it. You do it. Don't look at me like that—! Oh, fine. I'll do it.~
@35692 = ~We've an opportunity to end this by putting an arrow between her eyes.~
@35693 = ~Exercise caution, my friend. This could be a trap.~
@35694 = ~A trap? I think not. Look around. The "Shining Lady" has many strengths, but subtlety is not among them.~ [BD35694]
@35695 = ~This is new—she's never been willing to speak to anyone representing the Council before. If she'll talk to you... well, I doubt she's here to surrender, but we should hear what she has to say.~ [BD35695]
@35696 = ~Just—caution. Try having some for a change. ~
@35697 = ~I'll be careful. ~
@35698 = ~Caution is my middle name. I assume my mother was drinking when she came up with that. ~
@35699 = ~Respect. Try showing some where it's due. ~
@35700 = ~Not a good time for jokes, <CHARNAME>. ~
@35701 = ~I think you're wrong, dear lady. If one must face death, it's better to do it with a smile on one's lips, isn't it? ~
@35702 = ~Death? A little overwrought, don't you think? They'll have half a river between them. ~
@35703 = ~Well, if <PRO_HESHE> ISN'T facing death, I see no harm in having a laugh, do you? ~
@35704 = ~Boo likes a good laugh. But not an evil laugh! Boo has no time for those!~
@35705 = ~But not an evil laugh! Boo has no time for those! ~
@35706 = ~A chance to do what? Give the person who tried to have you killed another shot? ~
@35707 = ~I SWEAR TO YOU, NO HARM WILL BEFALL YOU, NOT FROM MY HAND OR ANY WHO FOLLOW ME.~ [BD35707]
@35708 = ~NOT FROM MY HAND OR ANY OF THOSE WHO FOLLOW ME. ~
@35709 = ~I SEEK ONLY TO PARLEY.~ [BD35709]

@35720 = ~What a dreadful person. She's an army of men at her beck and call; she could at least have the good grace to smile once in a while.~
@35721 = ~So that's Caelar, huh? I thought she'd be shorter.~
@35722 = ~The woman is mad. Yet her followers are blind to it.~
@35723 = ~Boo says... huh. It seems Boo needs to think on this.~
@35724 = ~Better a burned bridge than a bloody battle, I believe.~ [BD35724]
@35725 = ~There is not a shred of doubt in her, only clarity, certainty of her actions. Would that I had that strength. ~
@35726 = ~She fancies herself a goddess. But this goddess will kneel before me ere this is done. (And she WILL kneel… they will ALL kneel to Odesseiron.)~
@35727 = ~That shiny woman... Don't like her.~
@35728 = ~While we breed poisons below, we keep them to our blades. These surface poisons... faith and righteousness... you keep them on the tongue, making every word deadly. ~
@35729 = ~So that was Caelar. I'm beginning to understand why so many have flocked to her banner.~ [BD35729]
@35730 = ~She will be a formidable foe, but her arrogance will be her undoing.~
@35731 = ~If you can ignore the suffering she's caused, she makes a compelling case for her crusade.~
@35732 = ~Banners burn, sheep flee, and would-be prophets who overstep themselves die.  ~

@35734 = ~I serve Baldur's Gate. I do what the city needs done.~
@35735 = ~This reign of terror will meet the same fate as Sarevok's.~
@35736 = ~Be assured, the Shining Lady will pay for what she tried to do to Imoen and me.~
@35737 = ~The dukes can prattle on; their words do not interest me. Caelar's wealth does, and it will be easier to take coin from her corpse than the Council—for now.~
@35738 = ~I'd rather be wanted than had. Something about this smells funny. ~
@35739 = ~I don't see that we have much choice but to proceed to Bridgefort. ~
@35740 = ~Funny amusing, or funny I'm-going-to-regret-making-this-journey-if-I-live-long-enough-to-have-regrets? ~
@35741 = ~What would you have us do? Run cowering back to Baldur's Gate? ~
@35742 = ~Agreed. Let's get back to the camp. ~
@35743 = ~I never knew you were so... devoted, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD35743]
@35744 = ~To all who matter to me, I am. I believe you would do no less for the dukes, for the city—and for your daughter, Corwin.~
@35745 = ~I'm full of surprises. ~
@35746 = ~I have had enough talk of devotion, it is vengeance I seek. ~
@35747 = ~I'll bet.~ [BD35747]
@35748 = ~Let's head back to camp. With Tymora's favor, we might make Boareskyr Bridge before the crusade sets up another ambush for us.~ [BD35748]
@35749 = ~Hrm. There may be more to you than I thought.~ [BD35749]
@35750 = ~I've seen the arrogant prosper too often to count on it—but I hope you're right.~ [BD35750]

@35753 = ~Coin does not drive you, <CHARNAME>. I know you better than that.~ [BD35753]
@35754 = ~This is personal. Do not try to deny it. ~
@35755 = ~You should not take this so lightly, <CHARNAME>. Caelar seems confident in the righteousness of her cause. She will not stop until she is dead. Possibly not even then.~ [BD35755]
@35756 = ~She will not stop until she is dead. Possibly not even then. ~
@35757 = ~The last one.~
@35758 = ~There's no need to run. We could saunter languorously back to the city.~

@35760 = ~Our orders are clear. Crossing or no crossing, we move on to Bridgefort. ~
@35761 = ~That's all this is to you? Revenge?~ [BD35761]
@35762 = ~Caelar attacked Imoen, attacked me. I'd be lying if I said there was nothing personal in this. She made it personal.~
@35763 = ~That's what it's MOSTLY about, but not entirely.~
@35764 = ~Perhaps. What is it for you, Corwin? Is it enough that it is your duty to Eltan?~
@35765 = ~"Ours is not to reason why..." ~

@35789 = ~Nothing that isn't unnecessarily risky.~
@35790 = ~Define "unnecessary."~
@35791 = ~What's life without risk?~
@35792 = ~I wish I knew.~
@35793 = ~Curse you, Jayvis! Do you know what your cowardice has cost us this night?~ [BD35793]
@35794 = ~Hephernaan. What happened here?~ [BD35794]
@35795 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate arrived, milady—unbound and unescorted by your elites. This... MAN... panicked. He destroyed the bridge before our prey could cross.~ [BD35795]
@35796 = ~Forgive me, mistress, please!~
@35797 = ~There is nothing to forgive, Jayvis. The fault is mine—I should have warned you of this possibility.~ [BD35797]
@35798 = ~It is time this child of Bhaal and I had words.~ [BD35798]
@35799 = ~I AM CAELAR ARGENT!~ [BD35799]
@35800 = ~I WOULD SPEAK WITH THE HERO OF BALDUR'S GATE!~ [BD35800]
@35801 = ~And so the hero of Baldur's Gate comes for my head. Shall we speak and see what truth comes of it?~ [BD35801]
@35802 = ~Speak your piece.~
@35803 = ~We'll see about that. Speak, but keep your distance.~
@35804 = ~My actions will speak louder than any words between us, "Shining Lady."~
@35805 = ~You have thundered across the land this past year, your actions shaping the fate of nations. I intend to do no less.~ [BD35805]
@35806 = ~I look forward to our next meeting, <CHARNAME>. Until then, farewell.~
@35807 = ~We stand poised on the cusp of a new age. Someday, all Faerûn shall look to this moment and say, "Then. That was when everything changed."~ [BD35807]
@35808 = ~They sought only to protect me.~
@35809 = ~You were what brought me here—the attempt you made on my life, the damage you've wrought across the land.~
@35810 = ~Destiny, and the blades of the assassins you sent to slay me.~
@35811 = ~Pressure from the Council of Four and the payment they offer brought me here, though the opportunity to kill you is reason enough.~
@35812 = ~Nothing they do can save you now.~
@35813 = ~You wish to see me dead, then? More blood spilled in service to the Grand Dukes?~ [BD35813]
@35814 = ~Your crusade must be stopped. Were there any way to do that short of killing you, I would take it. Is there another way, Caelar?~
@35815 = ~In fairness, you did try to have me killed first.~
@35816 = ~At the absolute minimum.~
@35817 = ~I am not your enemy, <CHARNAME>... Consider for a moment the "poison" my agents sought to use against you.~ [BD35817]
@35818 = ~I am a drop of water in the river of my army. We will wash away all opposition. Return to Baldur's Gate. Tell the Council not to oppose me.~ [BD35818]
@35819 = ~Go back there. Tell the Grand Dukes I'll leave them in peace if they pull the Flaming Fist away from Dragonspear.~
@35820 = ~And what shall I tell them of your plan? What are these great deeds you have set for yourself?~
@35821 = ~I care nothing for the motivations of dukes—I am here of my own accord.~
@35822 = ~The Grand Dukes will not be turned, nor will the Lords of Waterdeep, nor the rulers of Daggerford.~
@35823 = ~Such humility in one whose shadow stretches far across the Sword Coast—your deeds are many. Slayer of Sarevok, hero of Baldur's Gate, and it is even said the Council of Four answers to you.~ [BD35823]
@35824 = ~And what of your intentions? If you wish us to stand down, then convince me.~
@35825 = ~Your grasp of reality is clearly as firm as I'd been led to believe...~
@35826 = ~You accuse me of feigning humility? And what of you, "Shining Lady"?~
@35827 = ~I have heard the whispers. Some see the fire in my eyes and call me mad. I am not. I am ambitious, yes, and I am righteous, but not mad. I see the possibility of a better world than this. And I will make my vision a reality.~ [BD35827]
@35828 = ~My goal is simple.~
@35829 = ~In our lifetimes, two Dragonspear Wars have ravaged this land. Fiends set out from the castle, bringing ruin to the land and dragging thousands of innocent souls into the inferno before being beaten back for a time. Those who follow me lost wives and husbands, parents, children, friends... But what was lost can be restored. I will bring those tortured souls back to Toril.~ [BD35829]
@35830 = ~They will be restored. I, I and those who follow me, WILL bring them back.~
@35831 = ~You cannot march into the Nine Hells and claim the devils' due! It's madness even to consider it!~
@35832 = ~You must know what you propose is impossible. Even if it weren't, no good can come from resurrecting those lost so long to the Hells.~
@35833 = ~Do you really believe such a thing is possible?~
@35834 = ~You should think to your own life before seeking to rescue those already dead.~
@35835 = ~But it does not end there. They are taken to the Nine Hells. Their blood boils; their skin blisters and bursts. Devils' claws rend their soul, tearing it to shreds—but they CANNOT DIE. I hear them, <CHARNAME>. I hear the screams of the unjustly damned. And I will not turn a deaf ear.~ [BD35835]
@35836 = ~I am not without sympathy for the souls of Dragonspear, Caelar. But what you attempt lacks strategy, and worse, ignores what could happen—perhaps again.~
@35837 = ~It is a fool's errand, and a blind and mad fool at that. The Hells will not surrender the souls, only take more—including your own.~
@35838 = ~If the Hells are your destination, then let me speed you on your journey.~
@35839 = ~No. No, there isn't.~
@35840 = ~I think I just said they had nothing to fear from me.~
@35841 = ~You have done little to fight the calling in your own blood, and you cannot judge me for the same, Bhaalspawn. Murder beats in your heart, justice and salvation in mine. In the end, we will see which beats stronger.~ [BD35841]
@35842 = ~The gods shelter and protect me and mine. NOTHING is impossible for me.~
@35843 = ~I cannot let you do this, Caelar. You've already brought harm upon the living, and soon you will do the same to the dead.~
@35844 = ~The gods protect you? What gods are those, then?~
@35845 = ~When you lay dying at my feet, you'll learn that not everything is possible for you.~
@35846 = ~Keep on believing that, madwoman. Believe it right up to the moment you die at my hand.~
@35847 = ~What gods? The pantheon shines its light upon me—Lathander, Tyr, Helm, Tempus—all see the righteousness of my cause. Soon, the Hells shall see that light as well.~ [BD35847]
@35848 = ~It is not the light of the gods, Caelar, it is your arrogance that blinds you.~
@35849 = ~Were it not for the damage you do the Sword Coast, I'd leave you to your foolishness.~
@35850 = ~Gods save us from your misguided beliefs and arrogance.~
@35851 = ~Keep on believing that, madwoman. No god will save you from my vengeance.~
@35852 = ~I regret the loss of those who stood against me, and trust that, in death, they will come to understand what I could not show them in life. I will honor their passing with the return of the Dragonspear dead.~ [BD35852]
@35853 = ~Your father was the Lord of Murder. Countless lives were stolen in his name. What if you could restore that balance—bring back those unjustly taken? Would you? Or is the call of your sire's blood too strong?~ [BD35853]
@35854 = ~Had you seen the streets of Baldur's Gate, felt the desperation of those your crusade has displaced, you would realize the folly of your words.~
@35855 = ~You tried to kill me and now you ask me to join you? You're as foolish as you are mad.~
@35856 = ~I do not heed the call of my blood. My actions are my own, and you will not sway me from them.~
@35857 = ~Think on it.~
@35858 = ~Arrogant? I serve the gods—you serve the corrupt, the ignorant, ones consumed with territory, gold, power—is that also your legacy, <CHARNAME>? Do you stand with them or for something greater?~ [BD35858]
@35859 = ~I would.~
@35860 = ~A tempting invitation. But no.~
@35861 = ~Very well. If this is your choice, then meet me at Dragonspear Castle, and we shall end this.~ [BD35861]
@35862 = ~Very well, then. Dragonspear Castle.~
@35863 = ~Your arrogance will be your undoing, Caelar. Surrender, and you might survive what's to come.~
@35864 = ~Flee then. I will come for you, and when I do, not even the walls of Dragonspear shall keep me from you.~
@35865 = ~A tactical error. I see that now.~
@35866 = ~Arrogant? I serve the gods—you serve the corrupt, the ignorant, ones consumed with territory, gold, power. Is that also your legacy, <CHARNAME>? Do you stand with them or for something greater?~ [BD35866]
@35867 = ~Arrogant? You call ME arrogant?~
@35868 = ~I do the gods' work, while you serve the will of the ignorant and the corrupt. It's not too late for you to get on the right side of history, <CHARNAME>. I don't want to be enemies.~
@35869 = ~After all you've done, you would have me join you?~
@35870 = ~Do you generally try to assassinate those you're cultivating as friends?~
@35871 = ~Then you made a serious error.~
@35872 = ~You and I will meet again, of this I am sure. We do not need to meet as enemies. Reconsider your course, <CHARNAME>, I beg you.~ [BD35872]
@35873 = ~The Grand Dukes' pressure and your own misguided convictions will muddy any bargain we might strike this night. For now, I shall continue along my own path, and you should do the same. We shall speak again. This I have foreseen.~ [BD35873]
@35874 = ~Until then, I will do what I can to repair the damage wrought in your name and protect the people of this land.~
@35875 = ~I understand your motives now, but the crusade has done too much damage for me to ignore. End this, Caelar. Find another way to rescue the Nine Hells' souls.~
@35876 = ~Don't be. I am <PRO_MASTERMISTRESS> of my own fate. Nothing is preordained.~
@35877 = ~So how does this work? Are you with me, running the caravan, what?~
@35878 = ~I've been thinking, I'd like you to stay close to me.~
@35879 = ~So how does this work? Are you with me, running the caravan, what?~
@35880 = ~I've been thinking, I'd like you to stay close to me.~
@35881 = ~You're the champion. The dukes say you get to make the call.~
@35882 = ~Very well. You're with me, then.~
@35883 = ~I value my independence. You take care of the Fist, I'll take care of myself.~
@35884 = ~And you're all right with that?~
@35885 = ~I'm fine with it—at least until it endangers my people's lives.~
@35886 = ~All right then. You stay close to me.~
@35887 = ~You take care of the Fist. I'll take care of myself.~
@35888 = ~As you wish.~
@35889 = ~Just see to it that you do take care of yourself—if you die, I'm the one who'll answer to Eltan.~
@35890 = ~How close is close?~
@35891 = ~As close as we can get.~
@35892 = ~Close enough to keep me alive.~
@35893 = ~Let's put it this way: If you can't put an arrow in the eye of someone attacking me, you aren't close enough.~
@35894 = ~Let's keep it professional, <CHARNAME>.~
@35895 = ~Yes, of course. My apologies. I still want you by my side.~
@35896 = ~If we must. Even restricting things to that level, I want you with me.~
@35897 = ~You flatter yourself. It's your bow I want, not... whatever else you might have to offer.~
@35898 = ~I'll see what I can do.~
@35899 = ~Got it. I can do that.~
@35900 = ~You all right, <CHARNAME>? Sounded like thunder coming from the crossing—I was about to send troops out looking for you.~ [BD35900]
@35901 = ~Caelar's people destroyed the bridge—the crossing is now a wall. We'll have to use Boareskyr Bridge to get across the Winding Water.~
@35902 = ~Nothing good.~
@35903 = ~Caelar and I exchanged words. It didn't end well.~
@35904 = ~One of Caelar's followers was... over-eager. The bridge was another casualty of the crusade.~
@35905 = ~Damn it! How could you let this happen?~ [BD35905]
@35906 = ~Save your disapproval for another time. We need to move on to Boareskyr Bridge.~
@35907 = ~LET this happen? Well, forgive me, sir—if I had your gift for soothsaying, this tragedy might have been avoided, but alas, I am forced to deal with things as they occur, not before.~
@35908 = ~Bridges fall down sometimes. What would you have me do about it?~
@35909 = ~Mind your tongue, Corporal, or you'll lose it—along with the rest of your head.~
@35910 = ~Let it lie, Bence. They aren't the enemy.~ [BD35910]
@35911 = ~Are you sure of that, Captain? We let this "hero" go off on their own, and the next thing you know, we've lost our way across the Winding Water.~ [BD35911]
@35912 = ~You think that's a coincidence?~
@35913 = ~Mind your tone, CORPORAL Duncan. We can discuss this later—in private.~ [BD35913]
@35914 = ~What's done is done. We need to break camp and get to Boareskyr as soon as possible.~
@35915 = ~Listen to the captain, CORPORAL.~
@35916 = ~Enough talk. Bridgefort awaits.~
@35917 = ~Agreed. Spread the word, Duncan. Mark the new route on everyone's maps. We move out as soon as our friend is ready.~ [BD35917]
@35918 = ~How bad is "nothing good"?~
@35919 = ~The bridge is out. We'll have to continue to Bridgefort on this side of the river.~
@35920 = ~Not BAD, exactly, just, you know, the bridge is blown up, that sort of thing.~
@35921 = ~I talked to Caelar.~
@35922 = ~It didn't end well for the bridge either.~ [BD35922]
@35923 = ~You—spoke to Argent?! She was there? Why—what did she say?~ [BD35923]
@35924 = ~It matters not. We need to get to Bridgefort as soon as possible.~
@35925 = ~I don't really recall. Something preachy.~
@35926 = ~She said we'd cross paths again, perhaps at Dragonspear—I'm looking forward to it.~
@35927 = ~Spread the word to the troops, Duncan. We're moving out.~
@35928 = ~A shrill shrew she is, shielded by a shroud of self-righteous sanctimony.~ [BD35928]
@35929 = ~You SPOKE to Caelar?~
@35930 = ~Thy words could wilt flowers, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD35930]
@35931 = ~No, they couldn't. That's stupid. You don't know how flowers work. Or words.~ [BD35931]
@35932 = ~Relax. Nobody's blaming you for the bridge, <CHARNAME>.~
@35933 = ~We need to get to Bridgefort. Corporal, spread the word to the troops to strike camp. Make sure to mark our new path on everyone's maps. We move out as soon as our friend is ready.~ [BD35933]
@35934 = ~Yes, Captain.~ [BD35934]
@35935 = ~Head to Boareskyr Bridge when you're ready. If you need to get anything done around here, now would be the time to do it—I doubt we'll be back this way anytime soon.~ [BD35935]
@35936 = ~We heard an explosion. What's going on?~ [BD35936]
@35937 = ~The crusade took the bridge out.~
@35938 = ~What?~ [BD35938]
@35939 = ~We need to get to Bridgefort. If Caelar destroys Boareskyr Bridge too, we'll be of little use to our friends at Dragonspear Castle.~
@35940 = ~Are you deaf, Corporal? ~
@35941 = ~Strike camp. We leave for Bridgefort immediately.~
@35942 = ~Strike the camp, Duncan. We need to move sooner than later; let's go.~
@35943 = ~Let's go, let's GO!~
@35944 = ~If we don't cross here, we'll have to use Boareskyr Bridge.~ [BD35944]
@35945 = ~Mm. Handsome AND a masterful observer of the obvious. The Flaming Fist does know how to pick them.~ [BD35945]
@35946 = ~It'll take us some time to break camp and scout the best way for the troops to take. Meet us at Bridgefort when you're ready. I'll mark the directions on your map if you don't know the way.~

@35960 = ~Miracle... turnip juice? This is going to be good. ~

@35962 = ~Guard, take this madwoman away. ~
@35963 = ~Be quiet, <CHARNAME>! I actually need some turnip juice—it's part of the potion that'll keep Adoy quiet— Oh, don't YOU start in on me now, Adoy. I'm doing this.~ [BD35963]
@35964 = ~Oh, don't YOU start in on me now, Adoy. I'm doing this.~ [BD35964]

@35968 = ~You heard <PRO_HIMHER>, gnome. Be off with you.~
@35969 = ~Wilhelmina Jansen, turnip-juicer extraordinaire! ~
@35970 = ~Yes! Just one sip of my product and you'll regrow limbs, gain blessings from at least three separate deities, and make contact with the dead! ~
@35971 = ~May I have a moment to tell you about the wonders of turnip juice? ~
@35972 = ~Are you... reading from a scroll? ~
@35973 = ~All the time in the world. ~
@35974 = ~No. A definite, steadfast, vehement, and if necessary violent no. ~
@35975 = ~Yes, I HEARD her! Enough already!~ [BD35975]
@35976 = ~But I haven't even—~
@35977 = ~I wasn't talking to you! Calm down. Gnome lady, you said you sell turnip juice?~ [BD35977]
@35978 = ~I don't need to! Turnip juice sells itself. ~
@35979 = ~I'll give you a sample! Then you'll see the tremendous power of turnip juice for yourself! ~
@35980 = ~Very well. Sample me. ~
@35981 = ~I'll take a sample, but I won't drink it. ~
@35982 = ~No, thank you. If you're an example of the benefits of turnip juice, they're something I can live without. ~
@35983 = ~You don't need to. Apply the juice to aching and bruised body parts as a natural remedy! Polish steel, silver, and other precious metals with it! Throw it in the eyes of a hated enemy! ~
@35984 = ~I'll take one.~ [BD35984]
@35985 = ~I swear to you, it's— What? ~
@35986 = ~One turnip juice, please.~ [BD35986]
@35987 = ~Oh. OH. Of course! Coming right up! Glittergold bless you, lady!~
@35988 = ~That actually sounds amazing.~
@35989 = ~Enough! I'll not listen to such blasphemy.~
@35990 = ~Did you know turnip juice has been proven to cure measles, mumps, and the common, slightly unusual, and positively bizarre colds?~
@35991 = ~It's true! On top of that, four out of five of those who imbibe turnip juice experience a productivity boost of over a hundred and twenty percent! ~
@35992 = ~But wait! There's more! ~
@35993 = ~More? What more could there possibly be? ~
@35994 = ~Gods. Make it stop. ~
@35995 = ~Legend has it those who imbibe turnip juice gain regenerative powers and even learn to speak with the dead!~
@35996 = ~I'd not be much of an adventurer if I didn't test the veracity of the legends. One turnip juice, please. ~
@35997 = ~If I take one, will you stop talking? ~
@35998 = ~For the love of whatever god you worship, please stop. ~

@36001 = ~Hah! See? I told you. A customer. I can stay! ~
@36002 = ~A little turnip juice never hurt anyone. Let her go through the camp and ply her trade. ~

@36006 = ~*sigh* As you will, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. ~
@36007 = ~One turnip juice! Don't forget to tell your friends!~ [BD36007]
@36008 = ~Look, there on that cart.~
@36009 = ~What is it? ~
@36010 = ~It's—it's a cart filled with scrolls! Gods, what wonders you have shown me!~
@36011 = ~Moldy papers and other useless junk. ~

@36015 = ~A feather from a planetar's wing. One more—SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP! Sorry. As I was TRYING to say, the feather's the next stone on my path to getting THIS guy OUT OF MY HEAD.~ [BD36015]
@36016 = ~Sorry. As I was TRYING to say, the feather's the next stone on my path to getting THIS guy OUT OF MY HEAD. ~
@36017 = ~Useless to YOU, perhaps. But not to the keenly probing eyes of the Red Wizard... ~
@36018 = ~I don't care about the moldy papers. It's the feather there that I want. The feather of a planetar's—OH, FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT'S HOLY, WILL YOU PLEASE SHUT UP? Sorry. As I was TRYING to say, the feather's the next stone on my path to getting THIS guy OUT OF MY HEAD.~ [BD36018]
@36019 = ~<CHARNAME>? I know this is silly, but I can't seem to find room for the feather in my pack. Help me out?~ [BD36019]

@36022 = ~<CHARNAME>? The feather? I could really use it.~ [BD36022]
@36023 = ~I'm trying. Just be quiet and give me some time...~ [BD36023]
@36024 = ~What do you say, friend? It's just a feather.~ [BD36024]
@36025 = ~Light. Easy to carry. Critical element of the potion that'll get this demented loon out of my head. ~
@36026 = ~Light. Easy to carry. Critical element of the potion that'll get this demented loon out of my head. Very, very useful...~ [BD36026]
@36027 = ~Hello? The feather? I could really use it.~ [BD36027]

@36034 = ~A seven-legged spider? I can't say I've ever seen such a thing.~
@36035 = ~If you want a seven-legged spider, look for a five-legged fly. ~
@36036 = ~What could you possibly want with a seven-legged spider? ~
@36037 = ~Ha ha. Funny.~ [BD36037]

@36039 = ~A seven-legged spider, you say. ~
@36040 = ~We need to find a way to shut that loon up before he drives you crazy. Well, craziER. You're already pretty—well, you know.~
@36041 = ~Are you sure he's real? The voice in your head, I mean. ~
@36042 = ~It'll be six-legged when I've gotten what I need.~ [BD36042]
@36043 = ~Vott? It is a seven-legged spider you are seeking?~ [BD36043]
@36044 = ~You know where I can find a seven-legged spider?~ [BD36044]
@36045 = ~Ja! With a horde of eight-legged ones. I came across just such a spider journeying back from the Forest of Wyrms. ~
@36046 = ~Ja! With a horde of eight-legged ones. I came across just such a spider journeying back from the Forest of Wyrms. It's not far from here. Perhaps you let old Voghiln take you where you want to go, eh?~ [BD36046]
@36047 = ~We all want to go there. ~
@36048 = ~Just draw us a map. ~
@36049 = ~Women like Neera don't go where you want to take them, skald. Not ever.~
@36050 = ~All? All right, Voghiln can do that. And when we get the spider, the elf lass can thank Voghiln personally, ja?~ [BD36050]
@36051 = ~Damn it, <CHARNAME>! Voghiln is a singer, not a car—a cart, cartog—~ [BD36051]
@36052 = ~You can do it. You're almost there...~ [BD36052]
@36053 = ~A mapmaker. But I will do what I can.~ [BD36053]
@36054 = ~I'm a half-elf.~ [BD36054]
@36055 = ~Half-elf, but all woman. Just the way Voghiln likes 'em!~ [BD36055]
@36056 = ~Voghiln couldn't help but overhear you just then. It might be the mighty boar of Luskan can help you.~ [BD36056]
@36057 = ~Is he real? Of course he's—YES, I'M TELLING—of course he's real!~ [BD36057]
@36058 = ~He's very real! He's TOO real! And he WON'T STOP TALKING!~ [BD36058]
@36059 = ~I need help, <CHARNAME>! I need the leg of a seven-legged spider!~ [BD36059]
@36060 = ~Vott? You insult the great balladeer of the Luskan crags! Voghiln should turn you upside down and use your face to dig a grave!~ [BD36060]
@36061 = ~Yeah, fine, do that, but can he draw us a map to the seven-legged spider first?~ [BD36061]
@36062 = ~Damn it! Voghiln is a singer, not a car—a cart, a cartog—~ [BD36051]
@36063 = ~I can scarcely believe I'm saying this, but I know where you can find one. I encountered a cluster of giant spiders not far from here. One had seven legs. ~
@36064 = ~I need to get rid of Adoy. Well, not get rid of him—YES, Adoy, I was just about to say—not get rid of him, but to get him out of wherever he is. And MY HEAD.~ [BD36064]
@36065 = ~A seven-legged spider, you say. ~
@36066 = ~We need to find a way to shut that loon up before he drives you crazy. Crazier, I mean. You're already pretty—well, you know. ~
@36067 = ~Are you sure he's real? The voice in your head I mean. ~
@36068 = ~It'll be six-legged when I've gotten what I need.~ [BD36068]
@36069 = ~I haven't seen one, but I'll keep an eye out. ~
@36070 = ~It seems Tymora smiles upon you, Neera. I've actually got a seven-legged spider leg. Here, take it.~
@36071 = ~I can scarcely believe I'm saying this, but I know where you can find one. I encountered a cluster of giant spiders not far from here. One had seven legs. ~
@36072 = ~I need to go there. RIGHT NOW. Can you take me, pleeeeease?~ [BD36072]
@36073 = ~Can you take me, pleeeeease?~ [BD36073]
@36074 = ~I do know. And you have no idea how sad it makes me to admit it—ADOY, IF YOU DON'T STOP YAMMERING, I SWEAR I'M GOING TO BLUDGEON MYSELF TO DEATH WITH A ROCK! Sorry, sorry. But yeah. I need help. Really.~ [BD36074]
@36075 = ~Sorry, sorry. But yeah. I need help. Really.~ [BD36075]
@36076 = ~This... This is AWESOME. Thank you so, so much, <CHARNAME>! Yeah. Yeah, this'll be perfect.~ [BD36076]
@36077 = ~Yeah. Yeah, this'll be perfect.~ [BD36077]
@36078 = ~I knew it was a long shot. Thanks, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD36078]
@36079 = ~He's very real! He's TOO real! And he WON'T STOP TALKING! Sorry, sorry. But yeah. I need help. Really.~ [BD36079]
@36080 = ~Are those—? They are! Spiders! How many legs do they have? HOW MANY?~ [BD36080]
@36081 = ~How many legs do they have? HOW MANY?~ [BD36081]
@36082 = ~That one in the back—it's got seven legs! THAT'S THE ONE! KILL IT! KILL IT!~ [BD36082]
@36083 = ~I need one of the seven-legged spider's legs. Just one. That's all I want.~ [BD36083]
@36084 = ~Yeah. Yeah, this'll be perfect. Thank you so much, <CHARNAME>. At this rate, I won't be driven completely mad before I get rid of—I mean, before I free Adoy.~ [BD36084]
@36085 = ~Hey! Spider leg? Please?~ [BD36085]
@36086 = ~You're killing me, you know that, <CHARNAME>? You. Are. KILLING. Me.~ [BD36086]
@36087 = ~All right! That's everything I need! LET'S DO THIS! Any time it's convenient for you, of course, <CHARNAME>. But, uh. Sooner. Sooner is better. Right now would be best.~ [BD36087]
@36088 = ~...any time it's convenient for you, of course, <CHARNAME>. But, uh. Sooner. Sooner is better. Right now would be best. ~
@36089 = ~But any time you're ready, I can brew this godsforsaken potion and finally silence this godsforsaken mage in my godsforsaken head! YES, I HEARD THAT!~ [BD36089]
@36090 = ~Deep breaths, Neera. Okay. Whenever you're good, <CHARNAME>, I'm good. Good. I'm good.~ [BD36090]
@36091 = ~I'm so very, very ready for this to be over already. Go to sleep, <CHARNAME>. This is gonna take a while.~ [BD36091]
@36092 = ~IT IS DONE. Ha hah! It is done! Dramatic, huh? All right... here goes nothin'...~ [BD36092]
@36093 = ~Dramatic, huh? All right... here goes nothing... ~
@36094 = ~Yes. Yes. YES! Silence—blissful, glorious silence! I never thought I'd hear it again. Or not hear it again. Can you hear silence?~ [BD36094]
@36095 = ~Adoy's still there. I can feel him, but I can live with that. I think I could even... I totally could. But should I?~ [BD36095]
@36096 = ~Slow down. Use your words. ~
@36097 = ~Should you explain to us what in the hells you're talking about? Yes. You should definitely do that.~
@36098 = ~Do whatever you're going to do, but do it quickly. We've lost enough time dealing with your imaginary friend. ~
@36099 = ~Fine. I get it. Stop talking about Adoy. Done. My lips are sealed. Onward!~ [BD36099]
@36100 = ~Right. Words. Okay.~ [BD36100]
@36101 = ~Sheesh, witchy britches. Calm down!~ [BD36101]
@36102 = ~The potion helped me focus. At least, I think that's what it did. I can control our link, anyway. That's the important bit.~ [BD36102]
@36103 = ~I can kind of—make him louder or quieter. If that makes sense.~ [BD36103]
@36104 = ~I THINK I could sever the connection completely if I wanted. Just... cut him off. I'm just not so sure I should.~ [BD36104]
@36105 = ~Really? Why not? ~
@36106 = ~What's the alternative? ~
@36107 = ~It's your head, Neera. You've got to do what's best for you. ~
@36108 = ~I get that. I do. But...~ [BD36108]
@36109 = ~He's trapped... somewhere. I think he's in trouble. If I cut him off, what'll happen to him?~ [BD36109]
@36110 = ~If he's in trouble, we should try to save him. ~
@36111 = ~Why do you care? ~
@36112 = ~As long as it doesn't happen to you, what difference does it make? ~
@36113 = ~Uh, I'm not really sure yet.~ [BD36113]
@36114 = ~All right, I'm gonna talk to him.~ [BD36114]
@36115 = ~Take as long as you need. ~
@36116 = ~Well, that should be fun. And by fun, I mean the exact opposite of fun. ~
@36117 = ~Keep it quick. We've got things to do. ~
@36118 = ~After everything he's put me through, I almost *want* him to suffer, but... he's still a wild mage. I can't just leave him, can I?~ [BD36118]
@36119 = ~I would. ~
@36120 = ~I guess not? ~
@36121 = ~I think you already know the answer to that question. ~
@36122 = ~You're right. Whatever it is—he got himself into it. He can get himself OUT of it. This'll just take a second...~ [BD36122]
@36123 = ~This'll just take a second...~ [BD36123]
@36124 = ~FREEDOMMMMM! No more Adoy, no more headaches... I could kiss you!~ [BD36124]
@36125 = ~Now there's a thought... ~
@36126 = ~What do you think will happen to Adoy? ~
@36127 = ~Then let's get going. ~
@36128 = ~Hey, at least you don't have to listen to the guy. Give me a sec; this won't take long...~ [BD36128]
@36129 = ~...I don't CARE if it's embarrassing, just TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE.~ [BD36129]
@36130 = ~Oh, you have got to be kidding... How in the hells did you manage that?~ [BD36130]
@36131 = ~Yes, I know you're not in one of the Hells. It was— Just listen a sec— Stop flapping your insubstantial ghost lips, PLEASE. Oh, that does it—this talk is over. I can do that now. BYE.~ [BD36131]
@36132 = ~That does it—this talk is over. I can do that now. BYE. ~
@36133 = ~Fugue Plane. Ugh. Okay. It *sounds* like he's trapped in the Fugue Plane.~ [BD36133]
@36134 = ~The Fugue Plane? ~
@36135 = ~Isn't the Fugue Plane where souls go when they die? ~
@36136 = ~How did he get there? ~
@36137 = ~And how would we bring him back? ~
@36138 = ~I've had a few too many thoughts in my head lately. It's time to act. Come a little closer...~ [BD36138]
@36139 = ~Mmm. Not bad. I'd rate it a six out of ten. A solid effort.~ [BD36139]
@36140 = ~I guess I'll just have to keep practicing, won't I? ~
@36141 = ~Next time, I'll try harder. ~
@36142 = ~...Uh, okay... Uh, hey! We should. Um. Go. Yes.~ [BD36142]
@36143 = ~The others are staring.~ [BD36143]
@36144 = ~Onward!~ [BD36144]
@36145 = ~Please don't stop on our account.~ [BD36145]
@36146 = ~Don't encourage them. There's a time for romance, and this isn't it.~ [BD36146]
@36147 = ~Still thy tongue, gnome. We've other things to do.~ [BD36147]
@36148 = ~Other things to do. Right. Onward!~ [BD36148]
@36149 = ~Ah. Yeah, I guess it is a thought. I think—it'd probably be best if we kept it that way. Onward!~ [BD36149]
@36150 = ~Don't know, don't care. He's caused me more than enough misery. Onward!~ [BD36150]
@36151 = ~Sounds like a plan to me! Onward!~ [BD36151]
@36152 = ~It's the place souls go after their host bodies die. Not a nice place to visit, and you shouldn't be able to live there, even though Adoy is somehow managing it.~ [BD36152]
@36153 = ~Yeah. How he got there, I don't know.~ [BD36153]
@36154 = ~Also very difficult to get to if you're not, you know, dead. Then again, my magic has done some pretty crazy things in the past... I guess it's not totally out of the question. ~
@36155 = ~My magic's done some pretty crazy things in the past... I guess it's not totally out of the question.~ [BD36155]
@36156 = ~He says there's some kind of mountain nearby that can help him out. I think he said mountain. He was, uh, agitated. Anyway, if I can find this Mountain of Nepenthe, I can bring him back to the Material Plane.~ [BD36156]
@36157 = ~So where do we start? ~
@36158 = ~And we want to do this because...? ~
@36159 = ~Mountain of Nepenthe. Never heard of it. ~
@36160 = ~You understand this is a distraction from our goal here, right? If we have a chance to help Adoy, fine, but ending Caelar's crusade is the important thing. ~
@36161 = ~Because if I were stuck in some kind of limbo dimension and another wild mage knew about it, I'd hope she'd help me.~ [BD36161]
@36162 = ~Adoy'll tell me when we're near. It's roughly north of here, so it's on our way... I think. Guess we'll find out.~ [BD36162]
@36163 = ~Yeah. Me neither. Adoy'll tell me when we're near. It's roughly north of here, so it's on our way... I think. Guess we'll find out.~ [BD36163]
@36164 = ~I get it. Adoy'll tell me when we're near. It's roughly north of here, so it's on our way... I think. Guess we'll find out.~ [BD36164]
@36165 = ~Yes! One step closer to getting rid of a certain someone. You know who I'm talking about, Adoy...~ [BD36165]
@36166 = ~Is this how you handle rejection, Voghiln? Not very suave. Perhaps I should give you some lessons on subtlety.~
@36167 = ~Who goes there? Boareskyr Bridge is the crusade's now, and Bridgefort will be soon enough. None but those who follow the Shining Lady shall pass here.~
@36168 = ~Excellent news, for I have come to serve under Caelar's banner.~
@36169 = ~I bring word from Caelar. Where is the camp commander? ~
@36170 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, slayer of unwary guards. ~
@36171 = ~You think you want to see the Barghest? Think again. Find the gnoll, Kharm. He'll get you set up. ~
@36172 = ~You have my thanks. ~
@36173 = ~Kharm, you say? ~
@36174 = ~"The Barghest"?~
@36175 = ~Pretty much the whole camp's taking part in Enlightenment right now. It's at the fire pit over yonder. You'll find him there.~
@36176 = ~Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast there.~
@36177 = ~Joining the crusade takes heart. Determination. Commitment. And 100 gold pieces to get past me.~
@36178 = ~I don't have that much money. ~
@36179 = ~I have nothing to offer Caelar but my service. ~
@36180 = ~Stand aside. NOW. Or you won't like what happens next.~
@36181 = ~Perhaps you have something else you'd be willing to exchange. What do you say, darling? ~
@36182 = ~You disgust me, you wretched little creature. ~
@36183 = ~Not if you were the last man in Faerûn. What am I saying? You'd have to be a man to begin with for that to happen. ~
@36184 = ~I say you just made your last mistake. ~
@36185 = ~Perhaps one of your friends here might have something to exchange. Standing guard for the crusade... it gets lonely, if you get my meaning. ~
@36186 = ~You sicken me. ~
@36187 = ~Let us pass, or I'll see to it your commander finds out you're barring recruits from the crusade. ~
@36188 = ~In about fifteen seconds, you're going to WISH you were alone. ~
@36189 = ~Then I'm afraid you're out of luck. ~
@36190 = ~You'd seriously turn able-bodied people away from the crusade for a paltry 100 gold pieces?~
@36191 = ~One of us is. ~
@36192 = ~Stand aside. NOW. Or you won't like what happens next.~
@36193 = ~Aye, but like I say, it's Kharm you'll be talkin' to. Or maybe Munsch. ~
@36194 = ~I'll be on my way, then. Thank you. ~
@36195 = ~Where can I find them? ~
@36196 = ~I'll kill them all in due course. ~
@36197 = ~Frigid witch! ~
@36198 = ~I'll gut you like a pig! ~
@36199 = ~No need for that. I was just tryin' to get myself warm... ~
@36200 = ~Y'think so, do you?~
@36201 = ~You'll find Kharm just down the road. If you reach the bridge, you've gone too far. ~
@36202 = ~Back off. You want no part of me, believe me. ~
@36203 = ~Kill them—? ~
@36204 = ~Help! Help! The camp is under attack! ~
@36205 = ~So that's the way you want it, eh? All right. Just remember, we coulda done this the easy way. ~
@36206 = ~You'll find the Barghest is in the large tent, center of camp. It's just over there. You can't miss it.~
@36207 = ~You have my thanks. ~
@36208 = ~I cannot believe that worked. Thou hast a silver tongue.~
@36209 = ~Are you challenging me? You know the whole camp'll come down upon you, do you not? You against a hundred able-bodied soldiers. The commanders will think we're under attack and slaughter everyone in Bridgefort too, as like as not.~
@36210 = ~Give me the message. I'll see the right person gets it.~
@36211 = ~I have to give it to the commander directly. I'm under strict orders.~
@36212 = ~The message is most urgent. Do you really want me to tell your commander you kept me from delivering it as soon as possible?~
@36213 = ~I'm afraid I can't allow that. ~
@36214 = ~Oi! Jossain! Fetch the Barghest! ~
@36215 = ~You're under strict orders? You think I'm not? I'm guessing you've not met the Barghest. Now begone.~
@36216 = ~Allow? You're telling ME you won't allow— Oh. I get it. ~
@36217 = ~Unfortunately, you're not dealing with Caelar. Not until you make me happy. ~
@36218 = ~Hand over the gold, or begone. I'll waste no more time with you.~
@36219 = ~You threaten me? ~
@36220 = ~Joining the crusade takes heart. Determination. Commitment. ~
@36221 = ~Kharm is who you'll want to talk to... eventually. But you've got to understand what you'll be getting into serving the Shining Lady.~
@36222 = ~I see a lot of folk like you, looking to join Caelar. She's been making waves these past months. But it's not as easy as just sayin' "I want in." ~
@36223 = ~Keep your shield up 'less you want your head cut off, Deyghul! Keep it up!~ [BD36223]
@36224 = ~You call that fightin'? Pathetic! I faced worse than you sittin' on me granny's lap!~ [BD36224]
@36225 = ~Do you wretches think this is a game? Do you think Caelar's enemies are playin'? DO YOU?~ [BD36225]
@36226 = ~Hit him like you mean it, Fellik! You're not playing with your dollies now!~ [BD36226]
@36227 = ~Fight like this when we get to the Hells and you're gonna die, you understand? I could weep. No god can save you lot. You're doomed!~ [BD36227]
@36228 = ~You, who are you?~ [BD36228]
@36229 = ~Liam Ensler, sir. ~
@36230 = ~Liann Ensler, sir. ~
@36231 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. ~
@36232 = ~Trouble. ~
@36233 = ~Don't give me any lip, recruit! One word from me and this entire camp'll be on you. Do you really want to fight every soldier here at once?~ [BD36233]
@36234 = ~I'm still unaccustomed to being part of an army, sir. Forgive me.~
@36235 = ~I apologize, sir. I'm just so excited to be here fighting for Caelar. ~
@36236 = ~Bring it on, you filthy cur.~
@36237 = ~Servants of Caelar! Slay this unbeliever!~ [BD36237]
@36238 = ~That's the attitude I like to see. When did you join us?~ [BD36238]
@36239 = ~It's only been a couple days, sir. ~
@36240 = ~Delgar Munsch recruited me a few days ago.~
@36241 = ~I didn't. I dislike being on the losing side.~
@36242 = ~I don't recognize you.~ [BD36242]
@36243 = ~I was recruited by Delgar Munsch, sir.~
@36244 = ~Should you? ~
@36245 = ~What of it?~
@36246 = ~Munsch is SUPPOSED to put all the new recruits past me first, but he often "forgets." One more time and I swear I'll have his leg off!~ [BD36246]
@36247 = ~He did strike me as a bit... difficult, sir. ~
@36248 = ~Good leaders are hard to find. Why the gods put fools in their place is beyond me.~
@36249 = ~As you should, sir. Now I must attend to my duties.~
@36250 = ~You know where Munsch is now? He and I are going to have words, we are. ~
@36251 = ~He's over yonder, sir. ~
@36252 = ~I've no idea. ~
@36253 = ~He's in the Nine Hells now. Here, I'll send you to him. ~
@36254 = ~Only if he knows how to talk with the dead. ~
@36255 = ~What?! We've been searching everywhere for that wardstone. You've proven yourself to me, soldier. I have a mission for you.~ [BD36255]
@36256 = ~I have every available crusader searchin' for a wardstone. They say it got stolen from the fort and it'll give us a way inside. If you find it, get it to me, and I'll give you an even more important mission.~ [BD36256]
@36257 = ~Dismissed.~ [BD36257]
@36258 = ~Talk with the— You're not crusaders! ~
@36259 = ~How would you like to prove yourself to me—to the man who really runs things for the rank and file crusaders?~
@36260 = ~You know we've managed to breach Bridgefort's outer wall? ~
@36261 = ~You have? ~
@36262 = ~The keep cannot hope to stand against the crusade. ~
@36263 = ~Very interesting. Here's something you may not know: The enemy's managed to breach your ranks. ~
@36264 = ~How long have you been with us? ~
@36265 = ~Not long, sir. ~
@36266 = ~Do you want to chat, or do you want to get to the point? ~
@36267 = ~Slightly longer than you have to live, fool. ~
@36268 = ~That wardstone will activate the teleport circle on the fort's eastern side. We can't get all our troops in that way, but you and a small contingent might be able to get through.~ [BD36268]
@36269 = ~And once inside, we could lower the drawbridge, giving the rest of our people access.~
@36270 = ~Sounds dangerous. Suicidal, even.~
@36271 = ~A significant risk. ~
@36272 = ~Prove your loyalty to the Shining Lady. Get into Bridgefort; lower the drawbridge. We'll have the unbelievers rounded up before they know what's happened.~ [BD36272]
@36273 = ~I don't think I'm the person for the job.~
@36274 = ~Oh, they'll know what happened. Trust me on this.~
@36275 = ~Quick. Devious. I like it.~
@36276 = ~Will you do it?~ [BD36276]
@36277 = ~I will, sir. ~
@36278 = ~It's—well, it's a little dangerous, isn't it? For whoever has to get in there, I mean.~
@36279 = ~Never! I will lay down my life for Bridgefort. Every soldier here will die by my hand!~
@36280 = ~Slain—? ~
@36281 = ~Yessss... You know I handle new recruitment for the Blinding White battalion, right? And yet, and yet... ~
@36282 = ~Munsch! That rat-faced little... I'm Lieutenant Kharm. I handle all the new recruits for the Blinding White battalion.~ [BD36282]
@36283 = ~It IS a dangerous mission—and it's YOUR mission. Get inside that fort and lower the drawbridge or I'll have your head on a pike! Dismissed!~ [BD36283]
@36284 = ~A tolerable plan, but I've a better one. After you penetrate the fort, you'll lower the drawbridge for our forces to enter. We'll have the holdouts rounded up before they know what hit them.~
@36285 = ~If we've taken the breach, wouldn't it be easier to bring our men in there? ~
@36286 = ~I think they'll have a pretty good idea what hit them. ~
@36287 = ~An excellent plan. A pity you'll not live to receive the credit for it. ~
@36288 = ~But you're NOT in your rights to disobey a direct order. That's what I'm giving you now. Get inside that fort and lower the drawbridge or I'll strike your head from your shoulders! Dismissed!~
@36289 = ~Good. Move 'em out!~ [BD36289]
@36290 = ~I'm Lieutenant Kharm. I handle the Blinding White battalion's new recruits. Which you SHOULD know...~ [BD36290]
@36291 = ~I was recruited by Delgar Munsch, sir.~
@36292 = ~You're Lieutenant Kharm? I've been looking all over for you. They said you'd give me an assignment. ~
@36293 = ~Oh, I knew. I just didn't care.~
@36294 = ~I like your attitude, recruit. How'd you like to prove yourself to me—the man who really runs things for the rank and file around here?~ [BD36294]
@36295 = ~Oy! I want to speak with Munsch! Where's the frogfiddler hiding? ~
@36296 = ~For a significant reward. ~
@36297 = ~An assignment, yes. I've just the thing...~ [BD36297]
@36298 = ~Awright. What's this all about, then? ~
@36299 = ~You are the Barghest? ~
@36300 = ~I bring word from Caelar for the Barghest. ~
@36301 = ~I've a message for the Barghest, from Baldur's Gate.~
@36302 = ~I'm Delgar Munsch. Right hand to Colonel Cordell, personal assistant to the Barghest. What's this all about?~
@36303 = ~A message, eh? Let's hear it.~
@36304 = ~It's not for your ears. ~
@36305 = ~I must give it to the Barghest directly.~
@36306 = ~It's a message best conveyed by things other than words. Your corpse should get it across quite nicely.~
@36307 = ~...What's your name again? ~
@36308 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. ~
@36309 = ~Liam Ensler. ~
@36310 = ~Liann Ensler. ~
@36311 = ~Do you really want to spend the last seconds of your miserable life asking stupid questions? ~
@36312 = ~The Barghest's a busy man. You want to talk to him, you gotta go through me. And you ain't goin' through me. Here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna take you into custody. Then we're gonna sort this whole thing out. That sound good to you? If it doesn't—tough.~
@36313 = ~<CHARNAME>? You mean iron crisis <CHARNAME>? ~
@36314 = ~<CHARNAME>? You mean iron crisis <CHARNAME>? ~
@36315 = ~Well, listen up, Ensler—the Barghest is a very busy man. You want to talk to him, you gotta go through me. And you ain't goin' through me. ~
@36316 = ~I'm sorry to have bothered you. ~
@36317 = ~We shall see. ~
@36318 = ~And I'm sorry, but I can't let you leave. ~
@36319 = ~Uh-uh. You're not goin' anywhere. ~
@36320 = ~Come with me. ~
@36321 = ~Barghest's busy. I'm Munsch, Delgar Munsch. ~
@36322 = ~I have a message from Caelar for the Barghest. ~
@36323 = ~Who? ~
@36324 = ~Not for long, you aren't. ~
@36325 = ~You threaten an officer of the crusade, here? Are you mad? Attack me and you'll bring this entire camp down around your ears.~
@36326 = ~Surround <PRO_HIMHER>. Take 'em alive!~
@36327 = ~Let's hear it. ~
@36328 = ~It's not for your ears. ~
@36329 = ~Sorry, friend. I was told to give this to the Barghest and only the Barghest. ~
@36330 = ~I had hoped to give it directly to the Barghest, but your corpse should send the message eloquently enough. ~
@36331 = ~Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am? ~
@36332 = ~I'm Delgar Munsch! I'm the personal assistant to the Barghest's right hand! An' you won't give me your message? ~
@36333 = ~This had best be important. ~
@36334 = ~You are in command? ~
@36335 = ~I bring word from Caelar the Shining Lady. ~
@36336 = ~Very important. I bring a message from Baldur's Gate. ~
@36337 = ~Vichand! You treacherous swine! The moment of your comeuppance is at hand! ~
@36338 = ~That mage behind the Barghest—I recognize her. She was with Caelar at the Trade Way... ~
@36339 = ~Edwin Odesseiron. I thought you dead. It would have been best if you were... ~
@36340 = ~I am the Barghest, commander of the Blinding White battalion. ~
@36341 = ~I have a message for you from Caelar. ~
@36342 = ~Barghests are evil creatures who feast on the flesh of humans. What manner of person would name himself such a thing? ~
@36343 = ~Soon to be the dead commander of the Blinding White battalion. ~
@36344 = ~Treachery! Behind me, Commander—I'll deal with this! ~
@36345 = ~Strike them down. ~
@36346 = ~Do you now? As the Lady Caelar is on the other side of Boareskyr Bridge and Oloneiros here only recently left her company, I find that... unlikely. ~
@36347 = ~That mage behind the Barghest—I recognize her. She was with Caelar at the Trade Way... ~
@36348 = ~Death to Caelar! ~
@36349 = ~Do we really want to know? ~
@36350 = ~There was a time such words would have earned you a demonstration of how I earned my name. That was before I was saved by the light of Caelar. Who are you? Why are you here?~
@36351 = ~That was before I was saved by the light of Caelar. Who are you? Why are you here? ~
@36352 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. ~
@36353 = ~These are the questions that keep me awake at night. ~
@36354 = ~I have a message for you from the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate. ~
@36355 = ~You! Behind me, Commander. I'll deal with this. ~
@36356 = ~As you wish. ~
@36357 = ~You should try a nice cup of warm milk. ~
@36358 = ~I've neither the time nor the patience for this foolishness. ~
@36359 = ~Come on, come on...~
@36360 = ~Where are we going? ~
@36361 = ~If I must. ~
@36362 = ~I don't think so. ~
@36363 = ~The waiting room. ~
@36364 = ~We don't have time to wait, <CHARNAME>. People in Bridgefort are getting sick... ~
@36365 = ~I'm afraid you do. ~
@36366 = ~Something about the way you say that makes me think you're not the one who should be afraid right now. ~
@36367 = ~You're no messenger. Take <PRO_HIMHER>! ~
@36368 = ~At last, the time for violence has arrived. Come, crusader! Let Minsc introduce your face to the dirt! ~
@36369 = ~Damn it, <CHARNAME>! He believed you! We almost had a clear shot at the Barghest and you threw it away! ~
@36370 = ~And here we go again... ~
@36371 = ~Munsch! Who've you got with you? ~
@36372 = ~A messenger who wants an audience with the Barghest. ~
@36373 = ~Then why're you walking <PRO_HIMHER> past the Barghest's tent? I just saw him there. ~
@36374 = ~I'm not just takin' 'em to see the Barghest, idiot. I've got this. You just worry about getting your people ready to face the Hells. ~
@36375 = ~Here we are. Now, get in. ~
@36376 = ~I thought we were being taken to the Barghest. ~
@36377 = ~I think what we have here is a failure to communicate. I wish to see the Barghest. ~
@36378 = ~I'll not be caged, by you or any man. ~
@36379 = ~Jal khaless zhah waela. There is no "failure to communicate" here. ~
@36380 = ~You'll see the Barghest soon. After you get in the cage. ~
@36381 = ~I'd prefer to see him before bars get involved, if at all possible. ~
@36382 = ~This is how you treat a messenger bringing word from Caelar? ~
@36383 = ~I'll see him after I put you in the ground. ~
@36384 = ~Die, lackey of light! ~
@36385 = ~Yeah. If you didn't bring word from the light, we'd strip you of your weapons and armor and THEN make you get in the cage. Now get in the cage.~
@36386 = ~You're making a grave error. I'll be taking this up with your commander, you can be sure of that. ~
@36387 = ~Fair enough. ~
@36388 = ~Not going to happen. ~
@36389 = ~I'll risk it. ~
@36390 = ~Very well. ~
@36391 = ~You risk your life speaking to me like that. ~
@36392 = ~I knew it. You're no messengers. Kill them! Now! ~
@36393 = ~Good. That's good. I'll inform Colonel Cordell you've arrived. You guards stay here, make sure they stay safe.~
@36394 = ~I don't think he cares what you'd prefer. ~
@36395 = ~You don't get in the cage, there'll be more than bars involved—there'll be blades. Get in the cage. ~
@36396 = ~All right. ~
@36397 = ~Blades, you say? Bring them on. ~
@36398 = ~There's a wise <PRO_MANWOMAN>. In you go. ~
@36399 = ~I've been caged once too often already. I'll die before it happens again! ~
@36400 = ~Remind me to stay on your good side, goblin. ~
@36401 = ~I think we managed to take them out before they raised the alarm. That won't last. We'll need to move quickly before the entire camp's after us. ~
@36402 = ~Halt! Come no farther!~ [BD36402]
@36403 = ~I wish to cross the bridge. ~
@36404 = ~Not even a little farther? Come on. A LITTLE farther won't harm anyone. ~
@36405 = ~You dare address me in such a manner? Let me speak to your commander! ~
@36406 = ~Caelar has decreed none shall pass.~ [BD36406]
@36407 = ~Far be it from me to question the Shining Lady's orders. Farewell. ~
@36408 = ~That seems a little extreme. ~
@36409 = ~I've a sack of gold here that says otherwise. ~
@36410 = ~Caelar doesn't always get what she wants. ~
@36411 = ~Begone!~ [BD36411]
@36412 = ~As you wish. ~
@36413 = ~I'm going, I'm going. Relax. ~
@36414 = ~I'll be back. ~
@36415 = ~Blessed be in the light of Caelar. ~
@36416 = ~My patience is wearing thin, <CHARNAME>. My patron demands blood—and soon.~ [BD36416]
@36417 = ~I do as Caelar commands. A wise <PRO_MANWOMAN> would do the same. ~
@36418 = ~I'd take your money, but my standing aside would gain you little. The mage Oloneiros has warded the bridge. None shall walk its length while she lives.~
@36419 = ~Go forth in the light, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. ~
@36420 = ~You can talk to me or no one. Preferably no one. ~
@36421 = ~I would cross the bridge. ~
@36422 = ~I will return. When I do, it would be best if you were somewhere else. ~
@36423 = ~Well, she's getting this. The mage Oloneiros has magically warded the bridge. None shall walk its length while she lives.~
@36424 = ~For now, at least. ~
@36425 = ~You must feel truly fulfilled over there, telling people to not do what they can't do already. ~
@36426 = ~I will return. When I do, you'd be wise to be somewhere else. ~
@36427 = ~Return to your assignment, mercenary. When Bridgefort has fallen, then you shall cross Boareskyr. Not before.~ [BD36427]
@36428 = ~Yes, I heard you! Now shut up, please.~ [BD36428]
@36429 = ~SHUT UP.~ [BD36429]
@36430 = ~Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, SHUT UUUUUUP.~ [BD36430]
@36431 = ~WHAT?~ [BD36431]
@36432 = ~Uh, I mean—hello! Hi!~ [BD36432]
@36433 = ~Hello. ~
@36434 = ~She's c-coping as best she can, given the circumstances. We all are. ~
@36435 = ~Wait a second. I know that voice—NO, NOT YOURS, THE NEW ONE—yours. ~
@36436 = ~Of course you know me. <CHARNAME>. You helped me deal with the iron crisis... ~
@36437 = ~You don't remember me? <CHARNAME>? I helped you find that wild mage you were looking for...? ~
@36438 = ~You could get to know it if you wanted to. I am <CHARNAME>. And you are...? ~
@36439 = ~I don't believe you do. Nor will you start now. There's a Flaming Fist camp not far from here—I'll seek you out there should I have need of you.~
@36440 = ~Adoy. Don't say his name. I realize you didn't say his name; I said it. I wish I hadn't said it, and you definitely shouldn't say it.~ [BD36440]
@36441 = ~Be quiet! I'm tryin' to talk to my friend here. Where was I? Oh, right. Adoy. He's been haunting me. Can you be haunted by someone who isn't dead?~ [BD36441]
@36442 = ~Neera. I'm a magician.~ [BD36442]
@36443 = ~A wild magician. ~
@36444 = ~Yes, all right, I'm a wild magician. Are you happy now?~ [BD36444]
@36445 = ~Half the damage y-you see around here is her doing. She was in a c-cell when Jaheira and I arrived. She m-made up for it, though. Her magic forced the crusade to k-keep its distance. ~
@36446 = ~Well, if you can't, he's doing what would be called haunting if he were dead. ~
@36447 = ~Yes, we're talking about you, and you aren't making it easy, so just be quiet. BE QUIET! ...You can't hear him, can you, <CHARNAME>?~ [BD36447]
@36448 = ~No. ~
@36449 = ~Yes, you know me! Neera, remember?~ [BD36449]
@36450 = ~Neera! Excellent. I could use someone like you—if you'd care to join me? ~
@36451 = ~Oh, right. The wild mage. I helped you find another you thought could help you... ~
@36452 = ~Right, right. You're a wild mage too. We were looking for another you thought could help you. ~
@36453 = ~I don't. But that can change if you come with me. ~
@36454 = ~No. And I don't wish to start now. Get out of Bridgefort and go east. There's a Flaming Fist camp not far from here—I'll seek you out there should I have need of you.~
@36455 = ~She's—that might not be a great idea. Do you like raging, un-uncontrolled walls of flame? ~
@36456 = ~Shut up. And just so we're clear, I'm NOT talking to Adoy there, Khalid. Now, <CHARNAME>...~ [BD36456]
@36457 = ~Can you get me out of this bloody fort? Yes? Count me in.~ [BD36457]
@36458 = ~Wow. You've only been here a minute and you're already less pleasant than Adoy, which I didn't think was possible.~ [BD36458]
@36459 = ~Don't let it go to your head, Adoy; you're still unbearable too. But at least I can ask this one to go away. You, <CHARNAME>. Go away. ~
@36460 = ~Take care. ~
@36461 = ~What are you doing here? How did you get in here, for that matter?~ [BD36461]
@36462 = ~Baldur's Gate. There's a small force of Flaming Fist mercenaries less than a day from here. This siege won't last much longer. Would you like to help me break it? ~
@36463 = ~Come with me. I'll show you. ~
@36464 = ~I'd tell you, but I can't be certain who's listening. ~
@36465 = ~Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's fair.~ [BD36465]
@36466 = ~Come with me and I'll take you with me when I depart. ~
@36467 = ~I'll leave you to—whatever it is you were doing. ~
@36468 = ~You can get me out of this bloody place? Yes. Count me in. ~
@36469 = ~Eh. I knew it was a long shot.~ [BD36469]
@36470 = ~I'm trying to get the ingredients for a—hey, I'm trying to TALK here—for a potion that'll SHUT HIM THE HELLS UP.~ [BD36470]
@36471 = ~What do you need? ~
@36472 = ~You clearly have more than enough voices vying for your attention. I'll not add mine to the load. Farewell. ~
@36473 = ~Nowhere to go but up, right? YES, I KNOW, ADOY. IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH. SHEESH!~ [BD36473]
@36474 = ~Let's see. Dead water from beneath Boareskyr Bridge, got that already. The leg of a seven-legged spider.~ [BD36474]
@36475 = ~I've no idea where you could find one of those. ~
@36476 = ~I do have the leg of such a spider. I don't know why I've got it, exactly, but I do. Take it, please. You'll be doing me a favor. ~
@36477 = ~I came upon a giant spider nest not far from here. We might be able to find a suitable leg there. ~
@36478 = ~Ho ho. Mighty Voghiln might know where you can find such a spider. It's not far from here.~ [BD36478]
@36479 = ~Honestly? That is so, so great!~ [BD36479]
@36480 = ~Does it need to have seven legs before or after you take its leg?~ [BD36480]
@36481 = ~Uh, before, I think.~ [BD36481]
@36482 = ~I also need a feather from a planetar's wing, some belladonna, a potion of perception, and the juice of one turnip.~ [BD36482]
@36483 = ~I have a planetar feather for you.~
@36484 = ~I came across a potion of perception not too long ago.~
@36485 = ~I have both the planetar feather and the potion of perception. They're yours.~
@36486 = ~Here, take the planetar feather and the potion of perception. Come with me and I'll help you find the others too.~
@36487 = ~I have the feather and the potion—they're yours if you need them. ~
@36488 = ~I don't have any of those things, but stick with me and we'll find them, I promise. ~
@36489 = ~I have none of those things. But I'll keep an eye out for them. ~
@36490 = ~Really? All right. I'm with you.~ [BD36490]
@36491 = ~I hope this isn't too forward, but I think I may be in love with you.~ [BD36491]
@36492 = ~Stick with me and we'll find the rest of the ingredients. I promise. ~
@36493 = ~Stick with me and we'll find all the ingredients you need. I promise. ~
@36494 = ~Come on. We've things to do. ~
@36495 = ~Good luck finding the rest of the ingredients. ~
@36496 = ~And you're just going to hand it over to the elf, aren't you? You make me sad, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD36496]
@36497 = ~I'm a half-elf, lady. And I've got more than enough grating voices in my head right now, so I'll thank you for not adding yours to the din.~ [BD36497]
@36498 = ~You'll give me the potion, <CHARNAME>?~ [BD36498]
@36499 = ~I will, just as soon as I get ahold of it.~
@36500 = ~Of course. ~
@36501 = ~For 100 gold pieces, I will. ~
@36502 = ~Done. Hand it over. ~
@36503 = ~I need them. They're my best chance of getting Adoy out of my head—OH YES, I WILL GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD! IT'S COMING, BELIEVE YOU ME! ~
@36504 = ~The feather and potion, here, take them. Come with me and I'll help you find the other ingredients as well. ~
@36505 = ~Here are the feather and the potion. Good luck finding the rest of the ingredients. ~
@36506 = ~Ah, I knew it was a long shot. Thanks.~ [BD36506]
@36507 = ~You! Gods, I hardly recognized you.~ [BD36507]
@36508 = ~Hey, you. How are you doin'—YES, I'M ASKING; JUST GIVE ME A SECOND, WILL YOU PLEASE? I don't suppose you happen to have found any belladonna on your travels by any chance?~ [BD36508]
@36509 = ~Or anything else on this list?~ [BD36509]
@36510 = ~What's on it? ~
@36511 = ~Doubtful. And I've little interest in finding out. ~
@36512 = ~A feather from a planetar's wing.~ [BD36512]
@36513 = ~I do have one of those. What else do you need? ~
@36514 = ~Good luck finding that. What else is on the list? ~
@36515 = ~I've not seen one, but I'll keep an eye out. ~
@36516 = ~I also need a leg from a seven-legged spider.~ [BD36516]
@36517 = ~Yes, I've got one! What else? ~
@36518 = ~Ugh. Even if I knew where to get one, I wouldn't be carrying it around. Anything more? ~
@36519 = ~Haven't seen one. Wouldn't want to. ~
@36520 = ~I saw one not too long ago, but I don't have it and I'm sure it's gone by now. ~
@36521 = ~What about a potion of perception?~ [BD36521]
@36522 = ~Got one right here. ~
@36523 = ~No, don't have one of those. ~
@36524 = ~Finally—and I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's on the list—the juice of one turnip.~ [BD36524]
@36525 = ~I have some. I don't know why, but I do. ~
@36526 = ~What would I be doing with turnip juice? ~
@36527 = ~Sorry, I don't have anything on your list. ~
@36528 = ~I don't know. What would anyone be doing with turnip juice? Other than making a potion, I guess.~ [BD36528]
@36529 = ~All right. Give me what you got; I need it to get Adoy's stupid—YEAH, I SAID STUPID! YOU DON'T LIKE IT? FEEL FREE TO LEAVE—voice out of my head.~ [BD36529]
@36530 = ~Of course, Neera. Here. ~
@36531 = ~Join me. We'll find what you need together. ~
@36532 = ~What's your mental health worth to you? ~
@36533 = ~You're the best, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD36533]
@36534 = ~Here, take the list. I'm not likely to forget what's on it any time soon. If you find anything else, let me know, all right?~ [BD36534]
@36535 = ~Very well. ~
@36536 = ~Really? You mean it? You're the best, <CHARNAME>. Let's go find some potion stuff!~ [BD36536]
@36537 = ~I've got 198 gold pieces.~ [BD36537]
@36538 = ~Save it. Join me and we'll find what you need together. ~
@36539 = ~Good enough. Here's what I've got. ~
@36540 = ~Let me know when you've got more. ~
@36541 = ~You're great, you know that, <CHARNAME>? Just a wonderful person. No wonder half of Faerûn wants to kill you.~ [BD36541]
@36542 = ~Wait, don't go—I didn't mean that in a—a bad way. You can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs, right?~ [BD36542]
@36543 = ~Nothing, huh? Guess I shouldn't be surprised.~ [BD36543]
@36544 = ~Come with me, Neera. We'll find what you need together. ~
@36545 = ~Those are some pretty esoteric ingredients. ~
@36546 = ~Hey, <CHARNAME>! Found anything else on my list yet? Getting pretty sick of Adoy running around in my head...~ [BD36546]
@36547 = ~I'm sorry, Neera. I haven't. ~
@36548 = ~Actually, yes. I've got your spider leg. ~
@36549 = ~I did find a feather from a planetar's wing. ~

@36654 = ~I've got one, but what in Toril would you want with such a thing? ~
@36655 = ~Sorry, no. ~
@36656 = ~Really?~ [BD36656]

@36658 = ~No. What in the hells would I do with a feather from a planetar's wing? Tickle a deva? ~

Level: Quest
Sphere: Summoning
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius 
Saving Throw: Special

Ghostly figures called by the Shaman swirl around the battlefield, tormenting the Shaman's adversaries. All enemies within the area of effect take 3d8 points of magic damage per round for the next 3 rounds (no save). In addition, all living enemies (undead and constructs are unaffected) must save vs. Spell or lose 2 points of Strength every round for 5 rounds. The Strength loss is cumulative, but this spell cannot reduce the Strength of a creature below 1.~

@36839 = ~It's good to see you again, Khalid.~
@36840 = ~You know me?~
@36841 = ~You are G-gorion's ward, are you not? He ask-asked Jaheira and me to ensure y-your safety.~
@36842 = ~Ah, yes. I remember now. It's good to see you again. Not as good as it could be, given the circumstances, but still.~
@36843 = ~I don't know you, but by all means, feel free to do as he asked.~
@36844 = ~I see. And did you grant him this boon?~
@36845 = ~We s-stood ready to do so, until we were called to this place.~
@36846 = ~Called by whom, I wonder...~
@36847 = ~Khalid! We have company.~

@36852 = ~HO THERE! Crusaders! We are prepared to negotiate our surrender!~
@36853 = ~We are p-prepared to negotiate our surrender! I would s-speak with your c-commander.~
@36854 = ~They're ready to surrender! Bring the Barghest!~
@36855 = ~I am the Barghest. I have the honor of leading the Blinding White battalion. Who speaks for Bridgefort?~ [BD36855]
@36856 = ~I, <CHARNAME>, speak for the fort!~
@36857 = ~Go ahead, Khalid. You can do this.~
@36858 = ~My name is of no consequence. What matters is that I speak for the fort.~
@36859 = ~<CHARNAME>? Here?~
@36860 = ~I am told you wish to surrender?~ [BD36860]
@36861 = ~Do we, Khalid?~
@36862 = ~We'd consider it... under the right terms. Bridgefort's defenders have suffered enough. Let them go and the fort and all within it shall be yours.~
@36863 = ~I'm afraid you were misinformed. I summoned you to give YOU a chance to surrender.~
@36864 = ~Were it just me, I would fight till my d-dying breath. But I w-won't take these others down w-with me.~
@36865 = ~The fort and all it holds is yours, Barghest—but only if you allow those within to go free.~
@36866 = ~Fortunately, I have no such misgivings. There appears to be an error, Barghest—I wanted to give YOU a chance to surrender.~
@36867 = ~You disappoint me. But after these past weeks, you do not surprise me. Crusaders, take up your weapons and strike, now, for our Lady!~ [BD36867]
@36868 = ~That is acceptable. Leave your weapons and supplies within the fort and then lower the drawbridge. My troops will not hinder you.~ [BD36868]
@36869 = ~The defenders will leave all their supplies behind, but I and a small party of my choosing will hold onto our weapons to ensure the defenders' safety.~
@36870 = ~Khalid, you've been fighting these people for weeks. Can we trust them to spare your people if they lay down their arms?~
@36871 = ~Hah! Coward! There will be no surrender, crusader. The time has come for battle!~
@36872 = ~No. It is Caelar's now. Accept that or we've nothing more to talk about.~
@36873 = ~I cannot. I must cross that river. Caelar's given me little choice in the matter. It that means we must do battle, so be it.~
@36874 = ~Very well. You have the word of <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate, that we will not attempt to cross the bridge.~
@36875 = ~Then we've nothing more to discuss.~
@36876 = ~And that's what you get trying to negotiate with zealots.~
@36877 = ~When you negotiate from a distance. Had we been within reach of the Barghest's blade, things would not have ended nearly so well, I think.~
@36878 = ~The Barghest is vicious, but by all accounts, he's not without honor. If you can hold onto your equipment, we can try to take the bridge once Bridgefort's people are clear.~ [BD36878]

@36882 = ~Do so and no harm will come to you or your followers. I swear it on my lady's honor.~ [BD36882]
@36883 = ~No. You can't. Caelar—~ [BD36883]

@36885 = ~Their presence changes things. You don't understand. You can't do this.~ [BD36885]
@36886 = ~It's already done, Oloneiros. If you've a problem with it, take it up with Caelar when we return to Dragonspear. For now, however, I am in command, and you WILL obey me.~ [BD36886]

@36891 = ~Are we having tea or negotiating? Barghest, you have my offer. What do you say?~
@36892 = ~It is agreed.~
@36893 = ~His name is Oloneiros, and he doesn't speak for the Blinding White battalion. I do.~
@36894 = ~We will give you Bridgefort and all it holds—but those within must be allowed to go free.~
@36895 = ~Good. Here's the deal, Barghest—walk away. Return to Dragonspear now and you'll live to see another day dawn.~
@36896 = ~So you are the man who will die at my hand. Good to know.~
@36897 = ~I can accept those terms—~
@36898 = ~No. You can't do this, Barghest. Caelar needs—~

@36900 = ~<CHARNAME>'s presence changes things.~
@36901 = ~My orders are what they are. Now be silent, Hormorn.~
@36902 = ~<CHARNAME>. Are you and yours ready to leave? No member of the Blinding White will harm them, unless they attempt to cross Boareskyr Bridge. On my honor and Caelar's, I swear it.~
@36903 = ~I can ask for no better.~
@36904 = ~I wish I could accept your terms, but honor prevents me from doing so. I must cross that river. Caelar's given me little choice in the matter.~
@36905 = ~Your honor means nothing to me, and Caelar's even less. Prepare for battle, crusader!~
@36906 = ~On my honor, in Caelar's name, I tell you no member of the Blinding White shall raise up arms against any who leave Bridgefort immediately, save those who try to cross Boareskyr Bridge.~
@36907 = ~Works for me. Let's get out of here.~
@36908 = ~We'll be in a better position to deal with the crusade when the forces here unite with those at the Flaming Fist camp.~
@36909 = ~Lower the drawbridge! The fight is over!~
@36910 = ~No. You can't.~
@36911 = ~My n-name is Khalid. I speak for Bridgefort. I'm prepared to s-surrender the keep to you, provided you let those within go free.~ [BD36911]

@36913 = ~Be strong, Khalid.~
@36914 = ~Perhaps he isn't, Barghest—but I am. And I'll not allow you to cut these people down.~
@36915 = ~This isn't a negotiation, Barghest! Those are our terms, take them or leave them.~
@36916 = ~Who is it that speaks to me now? Whose hubris is so great that they believe they can deny Caelar Argent's will?~ [BD36916]
@36917 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, slayer of Sarevok and hero of Baldur's Gate. And I say you will let these people go, or lose a score of crusaders for each life of ours you take!~
@36918 = ~My name is unimportant. Do we have a deal or not?~
@36919 = ~The defenders will leave their supplies behind. I and my companions w-will retain our weapons. I mean to ensure the defenders' s-safety.~ [BD36919]
@36920 = ~You and your people may go free—unless you attempt to cross Boareskyr Bridge. Caelar has declared none but her devoted servants shall pass there.~
@36921 = ~I don't like it, but if we're going to cross that bridge, we'll need the Fist to do it.~
@36922 = ~No member of the Blinding White will harm any who leave the area immediately. On my honor and Caelar's, I swear it.~ [BD36922]
@36923 = ~Your orders, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?~
@36924 = ~Tell everyone to prepare to move out.~
@36925 = ~The Barghest believes we're ready to walk away from this. He's about to find out otherwise. We'll leave the fort, all right. But not to surrender, no. We're taking the battle to the crusade.~

@36927 = ~W-what do we do now, <CHARNAME>?~
@36928 = ~Bide our time and prepare for battle. Watch to the east. When the Fist marches on the crusade, lower the drawbridge and have your people attack.~
@36929 = ~I'm going to sneak into the crusader camp and see what I can do to undermine their efforts. If you see a disturbance, consider that your time to strike.~
@36930 = ~I'm going to sneak into the crusader camp and see what I can do to undermine their efforts. When I blow this horn three times, that will be your signal to strike.~
@36931 = ~Lower the drawbridge. We're taking the battle to the crusade.~
@36932 = ~We'll be ready.~
@36933 = ~We'll d-do as you say, <CHARNAME>. But I don't kn-know how much longer we can h-hold out...~
@36934 = ~Minsc's time has been bided. He is prepared for battle now!~
@36935 = ~Battle will come soon enough.~
@36936 = ~In the meantime, what is there to drink 'round this place? Old Voghiln has a mighty thirst upon him...~
@36937 = ~Undermine the foundation and the whole house falls.~
@36938 = ~Is that a good idea?~
@36939 = ~It seems this fort has no good ale, no fun womans. The best it offers is a fight. Voghiln says we take what we can get.~

@36948 = ~I'm afraid you were misinformed. I summoned you to give YOU a chance to surrender.~
@36949 = ~You disappoint me. But after these past weeks, you do not surprise me. Very well: When next we meet, it will be in battle.~
@36950 = ~Well. That was productive.~
@36951 = ~That is acceptable—provided none of you attempt to cross Boareskyr Bridge.~
@36952 = ~Agreed.~
@36953 = ~The bridge belongs to us all!~

@37001 = ~Is there a problem?~
@37002 = ~Not a problem, more a question. You are clearly a man of honor, yet you serve Caelar.~
@37003 = ~No, no problem. I just wanted to take a moment to ensure I never forget what happened here today.~
@37004 = ~Yes. You're not dead. That's a problem.~
@37005 = ~I gave you a chance. You should have taken it. Now you will pay the price!~

@37016 = ~You spread propaganda in service to those unworthy of their stations—people who feel their power threatened by Caelar's light.~
@37017 = ~You call me an honorable man, and it is true... now. But understand: I am not honorable in spite of the Shining Lady. I am honorable BECAUSE of her. Tell that to those who dismiss us as mindless puppets. Now go.~

@37031 = ~I swore to the Barghest I wouldn't try to cross the bridge.~
@37032 = ~Yeah. Now that you mention it, they did. Someone should do something about that.~

@37034 = ~And Minsc is that someone!~
@37035 = ~There must be enough materiel in those barrels to level a city...~

@37050 = ~I do what needs to be done. Nothing more.~
@37051 = ~Where the hells were you? The bridge was almost destroyed! I suppose I should expect no better—you abandoned Bhaal, now you've abandoned his child as well.~
@37052 = ~They really couldn't be.~
@37053 = ~Your arrogance wasn't exaggerated either, I see.~
@37054 = ~It really couldn't be.~
@37055 = ~Tales of MY skill and daring, however, are absolutely accurate. If anything, they don't do me justice.~
@37056 = ~Bhaal died. I have no desire to do the same.~
@37057 = ~Just a desire to deal death.~
@37058 = ~You think I do?~
@37059 = ~Then keep your distance. It'll be some time before I forgive your leaving me to save Boareskyr Bridge.~
@37060 = ~Not too long, I hope.~
@37061 = ~Sometimes I wonder, <CHARNAME>. Sometimes I wonder. But there must be more pleasant—or at least more productive—things we can do with our time.~
@37062 = ~Ha. I think the dead god's priest loves you, <CHARNAME>.~
@37063 = ~No. My lust for murder died here, the instant Cyric struck Bhaal down.~
@37064 = ~Yet you associate with Hammerlust.~
@37065 = ~That'd be easier to believe if you didn't take your orders from that duergar scum.~
@37066 = ~If you have no stomach for this life, Patrescus, you're on a bridge. Feel free to throw yourself from it.~
@37067 = ~Another time, perhaps, and definitely from another bridge. But enough talk of the future—what should we do with these barrels?~
@37068 = ~Former priests of Bhaal must take their friends where they can.~
@37069 = ~We should toss these barrels into the river.~
@37070 = ~We'll have to take them with us. If we leave them where they lay, someone will inevitably blow their own arms off.~
@37071 = ~Toss them in the river. They're too dangerous to leave and far too dangerous to have anywhere near us.~
@37072 = ~We'd be fools to throw away such potentially useful assets.~
@37073 = ~Wait. The crusade's loss is our gain. We can use these against Caelar.~
@37074 = ~I'll get rid of them. It's the least I can do.~
@37075 = ~Transporting highly explosive material onto a battlefield. THAT couldn't possibly go wrong...~
@37076 = ~I'll not go against Captain Corwin's wishes. Go ahead, I'll help load the barrels up when the rest of our troops cross. It's the least I can do, considering.~
@37077 = ~You would use the crusade's own weapons against them. I like it.~
@37078 = ~Go on ahead, then. Make sure the crusade isn't arranging another fire elemental—or worse—for us. I'll help load the barrels up when the rest of our troops cross. It's the least I can do, considering.~

@37107 = ~What should concern you is how I'm going to leave. Lower the drawbridge, now.~
@37108 = ~W-what is the meaning of this, <CHARNAME>?~

@37110 = ~Don't try to stop me, Khalid. This is for the best.~
@37111 = ~Bridgefort's is a hopeless battle, and I can't cross Boareskyr Bridge while it still stands. Therefore, it must fall.~

@37116 = ~I'm afraid that's not entirely true. What I'm actually here to do is lower the drawbridge and end this pointless siege.~
@37117 = ~Thank the gods.~
@37118 = ~F-follow me, <CHARNAME>. There's a b-breach in the wall we can talk to the c-c-crusade through over h-here.~

@37125 = ~Seriously? You should have discussed this with me, <CHARNAME>.~
@37126 = ~After all-all we've done, you decide to simply lower the drawbridge?~
@37127 = ~You c-c-could have m-mentioned this to m-me earlier, <CHARNAME>.~
@37128 = ~There's no good way to do this, my friend. You'll have to trust me when I say it's for the best.~
@37129 = ~You have a problem with my decision, Khalid? Learn to live with it. Now lower the drawbridge.~
@37130 = ~You make it sound like there's something to discuss here. Lower the bridge.~
@37131 = ~V-very well. Mari, lower the d-drawbridge.~
@37132 = ~I nearly burned this place down helping to defend it! You can't just turn it over to the crusade!~ [BD37132]

@37138 = ~Are you certain this is the right move, <CHARNAME>?~
@37139 = ~I am, Khalid. Lower the drawbridge.~
@37140 = ~You have to believe I didn't want this to happen, Khalid. But even though it did, the bridge still has to be lowered.~
@37141 = ~Damn the crusade! Damn them all! This woman's courage has inspired me. No, the drawbridge will not be lowered. If the crusade wants it, let them give their best!~
@37142 = ~Very well.~
@37143 = ~A pity you couldn't have come to that before slaughtering the poor girl.~
@37144 = ~I—I mourn Mari's loss, but I'm g-glad you changed your mind, <CHARNAME>.~
@37145 = ~I expected better of thee, <CHARNAME>. I no longer know why.~
@37146 = ~You would help the crusade? Perhaps you know something Mighty Voghiln does not?~
@37147 = ~I don't know you. How did you get in here?~
@37148 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. I'm part of a Flaming Fist contingent from Baldur's Gate, here to help you hold Bridgefort.~
@37149 = ~I'm here to negotiate a surrender with the enemy.~
@37150 = ~What should concern you is how I'm going to leave. Lower the drawbridge, now.~
@37151 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate is here to help us? Am I ever glad to see you. I'm Mari. The lump over there is Estebarre.~
@37152 = ~Greetings. Happy to have you here.~
@37153 = ~Stay strong, my friends. This will all be over soon.~
@37154 = ~It's my hope I can negotiate a surrender for Bridgefort that will see you free to leave this place in something other than chains or chunks.~
@37155 = ~You guard the drawbridge?~
@37156 = ~No. I suppose I don't. But neither do you. If you want to negotiate a surrender, you'll have to talk to Khalid. He's the one in charge around here. I hope he'll tell you we'd rather die than lay down our weapons before the enemy. Now I have matters to attend to. Excuse me.~
@37157 = ~Who are you?~
@37158 = ~<CHARNAME>. I come from Baldur's Gate to help you hold Bridgefort.~
@37159 = ~I'm called <CHARNAME>. I'm hoping to negotiate a surrender that will see you all set free from this place.~
@37160 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. If you know of me, you'll know why you should do what I command. Lower the drawbridge.~
@37161 = ~Then you can talk to Khalid about how to handle the negotiations. I've got better things to do than parley with the enemy. Excuse me.~
@37162 = ~Surrender? I'd rather die!~
@37163 = ~I don't want to fight you, Mari. But if you don't do as I say, I will.~
@37164 = ~And you speak for everyone in this fort, do you?~
@37165 = ~Don't be an ass, <CHARNAME>. I'm Captain Schael Corwin of the Flaming Fist. We got into Bridgefort through the gap in the eastern wall.~
@37166 = ~Tcha! You have no sense of drama whatsoever, do you?~
@37167 = ~You're an optimist then. Well, no harm in trying, I suppose.~
@37168 = ~Better to live in shackles than die in fear.~
@37169 = ~I nearly burned this place down helping to defend it! You can't just turn it over to the crusade!~
@37170 = ~Fine, I'll let it down. But whatever happens next? That's on your head, not mine.~
@37171 = ~So you say. I'm not convinced. If you want to try negotiating, you'll have to talk to Khalid. He's the one in charge here. Now excuse me, I have duties to attend to.~
@37172 = ~I don't care who you are—no crusader sets foot in Bridgefort while I still draw breath! Die, you dog!~

@37181 = ~When we reach Dragonspear, you will experience the Enlightenment. You will be reborn as I was. And on that day, we will stride forth together, as friends and allies, part of Caelar's righteous crusade. Have you any questions?~
@37182 = ~I have a question. What gives you the right to do what you've done? How do you justify the evil done in Caelar's name?~
@37183 = ~I've got one. Why am I among these others? I lowered the drawbridge and let you in per Lieutenant Kharm's instructions.~
@37184 = ~I do have one, now that you mention it. I lowered the drawbridge. Why am I still among this rabble?~
@37185 = ~Yes. Why did your Shining Lady try to have me assassinated in Baldur's Gate?~
@37186 = ~Kharm. Is this true?~
@37187 = ~Well, ah—yes, m'lord. It's true I told them to get into the fort and let us in.~ [BD37187]

@37209 = ~I do. Why am I among this rabble? I serve the Shining Lady—I lowered the drawbridge and let you in, as Lieutenant Kharm requested.~
@37210 = ~Nope, that about covers it. Thanks!~

@37354 = ~Sarevok achieved great things. You could too, had you the courage to embrace the divine essence that flows through your veins. If you will not use your power, another will. It is inevitable.~
@37355 = ~Already an enemy has claimed your power for their own. You may never reach the one who desires the strength that is seeded in your soul, but if you do defeat this foe, we may meet again. Until then, fare well, <CHARNAME>.~
@37356 = ~Pathetic. Sarevok achieved great things. He had the courage to embrace the divine essence that flowed through his veins. If you will not use your power, another will. It is inevitable.~
@37357 = ~That is a battle you cannot win, and battles that cannot be won should not be fought. Submit to nature and you may achieve great things. Resisting it serves those who would see you fall.~
@37358 = ~You dare attack me? Foolish. You have power, but not that much. Not yet.~
@37359 = ~Where to first?~
@37360 = ~The Elfsong Tavern.~
@37361 = ~Three Old Kegs.~
@37362 = ~The Iron Throne~
@37363 = ~Flaming Fist headquarters.~
@37364 = ~I'm going to keep looking around here for a bit.~
@37365 = ~Where to next?~
@37366 = ~Back to the Palace.~
@37367 = ~Fine.~
@37368 = ~Let's go.~
@37369 = ~I'll wait for you here.~
@37370 = ~Thank you. I'll return shortly.~
@37371 = ~Who am I here to see again?~
@37372 = ~No waiting required. I've seen enough of this place.~
@37373 = ~The sooner the better.~
@37374 = ~The bard Garrick, or the ne'er-do-wells Safana and Coran.~
@37375 = ~Right, of course. I'll be back shortly.~
@37376 = ~Garrick?~
@37377 = ~Safana and Coran?~
@37378 = ~I don't know any of these people.~
@37379 = ~Garrick's a bard of no little repute, at least to hear him tell it. Safana and Coran—well, let's not mince words here, they're thieves. All three have skills that might be useful in the journey ahead.~
@37380 = ~All right. I'll go see if I can find them.~
@37381 = ~They don't sound that useful to me, but now that we're here, I might as well have a look around.~
@37382 = ~I'll be the judge of that, assuming I can find them.~
@37383 = ~You need me, you know where to find me.~
@37384 = ~A bard of no little repute, at least to hear him tell it. His skills may prove useful in the journey ahead.~
@37385 = ~All right. I'll go see if I can find him.~
@37386 = ~He doesn't sound that useful to me, but now that we're here, I might as well have a look around.~
@37387 = ~I'll be the judge of that, assuming I can find him.~
@37388 = ~They're—let's not mince words here, they're thieves. Reasonably effective ones, as individuals. As a couple... they're less than the sum of their parts, or so I'm told. Even so, their skills may prove useful.~
@37389 = ~All right. I'll go see if I can find them.~
@37390 = ~They don't sound that useful to me, but now that we're here I might as well have a look around.~
@37391 = ~I'll be the judge of that, assuming I can find them.~
@37392 = ~The Rashemaar witch Dynaheir and her bodyguard, the ranger Minsc.~
@37393 = ~Right, of course. I'll go see if I can find them.~
@37394 = ~And Boo?~
@37395 = ~Who?~
@37396 = ~The hamster? Yes, I understand that's here too, though the innkeeper's not thrilled about it.~
@37397 = ~I'll see if I can find them. You stay here.~
@37398 = ~I don't know if I want to talk to the Rashemaar, but seeing as we're here, I might as well see what this place has to offer.~
@37399 = ~I would think not. I don't want to talk to these people. Let's get out of here.~
@37400 = ~A pair of Rashemaar adventurers. They're here on a quest of some sort—a dajemma, I think it's called? Dynaheir claims she's here to witness some unspecified great thing that's to occur on the Sword Coast. Minsc is to protect her until she sees what she's come to see.~
@37401 = ~By all accounts, they're both crazier than rabid hedgehogs, but I can't deny their skills could be useful when we confront the crusade.~
@37402 = ~All right. I'll go see if I can find them.~
@37403 = ~They don't sound that useful to me, but now that we're here I might as well have a look around.~
@37404 = ~I'll be the judge of that, assuming I can find them.~
@37405 = ~The religious lunatic Tiax. Don't ask me why—I think we should let him rot, but the dukes think he may be of use in the battle against Caelar. He's down the corridor to the right .Try not to get to close to the cell. He's been known to fling things at people.~
@37406 = ~I'll go speak to him.~
@37407 = ~Well, we're here. I might as well have a look around, at least.~
@37408 = ~I've no desire to be here and even less to speak to this Tiax.~
@37409 = ~You're a wise <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>.~
@37410 = ~His name's Rasaad. He's a member of the Sun Soul order and worshipper of the moon goddess Selûne. Don't ask me how THAT works. But his skills could prove useful in the days ahead.~
@37411 = ~Rasaad, of course. I'll go seek him out.~
@37412 = ~What's a monk of the Sun Soul doing in the Iron Throne building?~
@37413 = ~I've no desire to speak to this monk, but I would like to take a look at what's been done here.~
@37414 = ~Redeeming it, as much as a place can be redeemed. Several orders have banded together to offer refuge in the Iron Throne to those displaced by the crusade. The Selûnites are among them.~
@37415 = ~A worthy cause. I'll see if I can find this monk.~
@37416 = ~Interesting. I'll take a look around.~
@37417 = ~This place reeks of self-righteousness. I would spend no more time in this stench.~
@37418 = ~I imagine this place holds a lot of memories for you. I'll leave you to it.~
@37419 = ~Not a godly <PRO_MANWOMAN>, eh? I can see why. What little they've done for us mortals has rarely been to our benefit.~
@37420 = ~I don't know. Your friend Imoen, perhaps? Or your bed.~
@37421 = ~Yes, I should see how Imoen is doing. I'll go find her.~
@37422 = ~Sleep would be nice.~
@37423 = ~I doubt I'll be sleeping much this night.~
@37424 = ~I'll be coordinating the Flaming Fist's caravan work from here, if you need me. Do me a favor and don't need me.~
@37425 = ~Nor will I.~
@37426 = ~Your call.~
@37427 = ~Phossey Dugdeep~

@37430 = ~Marshal Nederlok~

@37432 = ~Hooded Man~
@37433 = ~Imoen lies still on the bed. Her chest rises and falls—she lives. That is all you can be sure of. For now, it will have to be enough.~
@37434 = ~Captain Corwin. Good to see you.~ [BD37434]
@37435 = ~And you, Marshal Nederlok.~ [BD37435]
@37436 = ~And this must be the so-called hero of Baldur's Gate I've heard so much about.~ [BD37436]
@37437 = ~The Grand Dukes have accorded me that honor. Given the sacrifices all the people of Baldur's Gate made during the iron crisis, I'm not completely comfortable with it.~
@37438 = ~That's what they call me. What the nice ones call me, at any rate. ~
@37439 = ~Where is Caelar? I would see this matter finished. ~
@37440 = ~If it makes you feel any better, don't expect a Baldur's Gate reception here. Word of what happened at Boareskyr Bridge is getting around. ~
@37441 = ~I'm afraid you'll not find a warm reception here. Word of what happened at Boareskyr Bridge is getting around. Many—too many—see you as Sarevok's heir apparent.~ [BD37441]
@37442 = ~I look forward to proving them wrong. ~
@37443 = ~Of course they do. Why wouldn't they? I only risked my life to save the Sword Coast from his diabolical machinations.~
@37444 = ~What they believe is of no consequence. But if they raise a hand against me, may the gods have mercy upon them. I won't.~
@37445 = ~If anyone gives you trouble, report it to me. I'll take care of it.~ [BD37445]
@37446 = ~Go get settled in now. When you're ready, come see me and the other commanders at the large tent south of here.~ [BD37446]
@37447 = ~We'll do that. Thank you, sir.~ [BD37447]
@37448 = ~You and me both. For the moment, she's safe behind Dragonspear's walls. I've been arguing for a full assault for days. The Waterdhavian commander, Torsin de Lancie, has been holding us back—and using you as an excuse.~ [BD37448]
@37449 = ~Of course. It's always the troops' fault.~ [BD37449]
@37450 = ~His claim is that he doesn't want to push into Dragonspear until reinforcements arrive. Now that you are here... Well, he'll probably think of another excuse not to act. He's good at that.~ [BD37450]
@37451 = ~Well, don't expect a Baldur's Gate reception here. Word of what happened at Boareskyr Bridge is getting around. ~
@37452 = ~Glad to hear it.~ [BD37452]
@37453 = ~Humility. Feh.~ [BD37453]
@37454 = ~To your face, anyway.~ [BD37454]
@37455 = ~Is—is that a goblin?~ [BD37455]
@37456 = ~Her name is M'Khiin. She's with me. Is that a problem?~
@37457 = ~A goblin? WHERE? WHERE? Oh, you're talking about M'Khiin? Yeah, a goblin. She's with me. ~
@37458 = ~That is M'Khiin. Any who interfere with her will answer to me. Am I understood? ~
@37459 = ~It's not like to win you any friends, let's put it that way. I'll spread the word, but for her sake and your own, it'd be best if you kept a low profile.~ [BD37459]
@37460 = ~I'll do what I can.~ [BD37460]
@37461 = ~The gossips' tongues will fall off before tomorrow dawns. Do what you can to keep a low profile—for all your sakes.~ [BD37461]
@37462 = ~I'll keep her out of trouble, sir.~ [BD37462]
@37463 = ~Finally, you're here.~ [BD37463]
@37464 = ~I was just about to say the same thing. I'm <CHARNAME>. And you are? ~
@37465 = ~No, no, please skip the formalities and go straight to complaining about trivialities.~
@37466 = ~I'm Kyrill Nederlok, marshal of the Burnt Stone cadre. I command the Flaming Fist contingent of the Dragonspear campaign.~ [BD37466]
@37467 = ~Good to meet you, Marshal. I'm sure you and your people haven't had it easy these past weeks. I hope our arrival will turn the tide somewhat.~
@37468 = ~I'm glad for you.~
@37469 = ~Where is Caelar? I would see this matter finished. ~
@37470 = ~And that would make YOU the so-called hero of Baldur's Gate. The stories of your glib tongue were no exaggeration.~ [BD37470]
@37471 = ~Good to meet you, General. I'm sure you and your people haven't had it easy these past weeks. I hope our arrival will turn the tide somewhat. ~
@37472 = ~That's a shame. Still, I suppose we can't all be called hero. People would get confused. ~
@37473 = ~Where is Caelar? I would see this matter finished. ~
@37474 = ~The lazy remember only that which is most convenient.~ [BD37474]
@37475 = ~Mm, not so much. I once drank so much I married three wenches in one night and remembered none of it come the morn. Ho ho! It was MOST inconvenient when the Mrs. Voghilns introduced themselves to each other!~ [BD37475]
@37476 = ~I hope you're right. I should warn you, though—don't expect a Baldur's Gate reception here. Word of what happened at Boareskyr Bridge is getting around.~ [BD37476]
@37477 = ~I should warn you—don't expect a warm reception here. Word of what happened at Boareskyr Bridge spread like wildfire. Many in this camp—too many—see you as Sarevok's heir apparent.~ [BD37477]
@37478 = ~No words will change their minds, but through my actions, they will know my heart.~
@37479 = ~Of course they do. Why wouldn't they? I only risked my life to save the entire Sword Coast from his diabolical machinations. ~
@37480 = ~What they believe is of no consequence. But if they raise a hand against me, may the gods have mercy upon them. I won't. ~
@37481 = ~Crusade, Flaming Fist, Shadow Thieves, Harpers, Zhentarim... I care not who is in service to what. Anyone fool enough to stand against me and mine will taste my steel.~ [BD37481]
@37482 = ~They don't care about your heart. Nobody cares.~ [BD37482]
@37483 = ~If anyone gives you trouble, report it to me. I'll take care of it.~ [BD37483]
@37484 = ~Go get settled in now. After you've done that, come see me and the other city commanders at the large tent south of here.~ [BD37484]
@37485 = ~Is good. Now whose patz do I slap to get an ale around here?~ [BD37485]
@37486 = ~You and me both. For the moment, she's safe behind Dragonspear's walls. I've been arguing for a full assault for days. The Waterdhavian commander, Torsin de Lancie, has been holding us back—and using you as an excuse.~ [BD37486]
@37487 = ~He's insisted on delaying any push into Dragonspear until reinforcements arrived. Now that you're here... Well, he'll probably think of some other excuse not to act. He has a talent for that.~ [BD37487]
@37488 = ~I should warn you—don't expect a Baldur's Gate reception here. Word of what happened at Boareskyr Bridge is getting around. ~
@37489 = ~Enough bootlicking, <CHARNAME>. This idiot owes you his thanks, not the other way around.~ [BD37489]
@37490 = ~Minsc is also glad! Boo, are you—? Yes, Boo is glad also. We are all glad! It is good.~ [BD37490]
@37491 = ~Do not worry thyself about it, Minsc. I will explain it all to thee later. ~
@37492 = ~Is—is that a goblin?~ [BD37455]
@37493 = ~Her name is M'Khiin. She's with me. Is that a problem? ~
@37494 = ~A goblin? WHERE? WHERE? Oh, you're talking about M'Khiin? Yeah, a goblin. She's with me. ~
@37495 = ~That is M'Khiin. Any who interfere with her will answer to me. Am I understood? ~
@37496 = ~It won't win you any friends, let's put it that way. I'll spread the word, but for her sake and your own, it'd be best for you to keep a low profile. ~
@37497 = ~I'll do what I can.~ [BD37497]
@37498 = ~The gossips' tongues will fall off before tomorrow dawns. Do what you can to keep a low profile—for all your sakes.~ [BD37461]
@37499 = ~I don't want any trouble.~ [BD37499]
@37500 = ~I'll spread word to the troops to ask first and attack later should they encounter any goblins. But it'd best for all if she stayed close to your side. ~
@37501 = ~You gutless worm! What gives you the right to tell me what to do with my men?~ [BD37501]
@37502 = ~You mean your fifty men? Why, my three hundred and fifty men, of course.~ [BD37502]
@37503 = ~A tenth of Daggerford's population, de Lancie! One in ten! That's what I'VE brought to this effort!~ [BD37503]
@37504 = ~And it is appreciated. But Baldur's Gate and especially Waterdeep have provided the majority of troops here. I'll not risk them needlessly.~ [BD37504]
@37505 = ~Can I be of assistance here? ~
@37506 = ~Inaction carries its own risks. ~
@37507 = ~Silence! Your voices grate. I'll listen to them no longer. ~
@37508 = ~Show a little respect, <CHARNAME>...~ [BD37508]
@37509 = ~In fairness to them, their voices really DO grate...~ [BD37509]
@37510 = ~Who the hells are you now?~ [BD37510]
@37511 = ~It is always better to do something instead of nothing. Right, Boo?~ [BD37511]
@37512 = ~It is always better to drink something instead of nothing. Where can old Voghiln find himself some ale?~ [BD37512]
@37513 = ~And who, pray tell, are you?~ [BD37513]
@37514 = ~Oh, aye? So what was that business on Boareskyr Bridge about? You know how many of our people worship Lathander? Tempus? And you burn the dead Lord of bloody Murder Bhaal's symbol into the ground where he died? Great, that's SURE to boost morale...~ [BD37514]
@37515 = ~Haither, please, show a LITTLE decorum...~ [BD37515]
@37516 = ~The General's suspicions are well-founded. You should know that I am a child of Bhaal, as was Sarevok. But I assure you, a father is all we shared.~
@37517 = ~Decorum doesn't seem to be a great concern for General Stonehand.~
@37518 = ~You ask what Boareskyr Bridge was about, General? I'll tell you: I was sending a message to Caelar—and to all who'd stand against me.~
@37519 = ~Too bad. We could use a Sarevok right now. At least he got things done. ~
@37520 = ~The forces you travel with are a welcome and much-needed asset. Your presence is... problematic. The rank and file have heard of your antics at Boareskyr. They are... agitated. ~
@37521 = ~The reinforcements you've brought are a welcome and much-needed asset, <CHARNAME>. YOUR presence is problematic. Many are... disturbed... by tales of Boareskyr Bridge. It would be best if you were away from the camp for a time.~ [BD37521]
@37522 = ~I am yours to command. What would you have me do? ~
@37523 = ~Considering what I endured to reach this place, this isn't exactly the welcome I'd hoped for. ~
@37524 = ~You would send me from here on account of some cowards' whining? What kind of commander are you? ~
@37525 = ~General Haither Stonehand, Torsin Cedric de Lancie, allow me to present the hero of Baldur's Gate.~ [BD37525]
@37526 = ~As it happens, there is something that requires attention a ways from here. ~
@37527 = ~Oh, gods, don't start with THIS again. ~
@37528 = ~Excuse us, Torsin, general.~ [BD37528]
@37529 = ~A highly successful one.~ [BD37529]
@37530 = ~A leader must support their troops if they want their troops to support them.~ [BD37530]
@37531 = ~To lead, one must instill fear in one's followers. They must know insubordination will cost them more than any enemy ever could.~ [BD37531]
@37532 = ~I've had worse.~ [BD37532]
@37533 = ~If we've any hope of defeating the crusade, troop morale must be maintained. Your presence works against that.~ [BD37533]
@37534 = ~Ah, I see it now. You think you're better than us. You think this is about you. Gods help us all.~
@37535 = ~Decorum is for nobles and their toadies. We're here to slay the Shining Lady, not enjoy a fine dinner with her.~ [BD37535]
@37536 = ~You are most perceptive. And, loath though I am to agree with her, General Stonehand has a point.~ [BD37536]
@37537 = ~As it happens, there is a matter that requires attention a ways from here. Word has gotten 'round that Caelar's forces are receiving supplies via caverns beneath Dragonspear Castle. We have a rough idea where the entrance is—beyond Dead Man's Pass, as the locals like to call it.~ [BD37537]
@37538 = ~That's assuming the information we have is accurate. Torture usually gets you answers, but it doesn't always get you the truth.~ [BD37538]
@37539 = ~That's why I want <CHARNAME> to establish the veracity of the claims.~
@37540 = ~That should be easy enough.~
@37541 = ~I come all the way from Baldur's Gate and you want me to go just a little bit farther. Not much of a welcome, Torsin de Lancie. ~
@37542 = ~You would waste my talents on a simple reconnaissance mission? ~
@37543 = ~Heh. Those are words no one who's spoken them has ever come to regret...~
@37544 = ~What are you playing at, monkey? Dragonspear Castle lies not half a mile from here, and you would have us go spelunking? (In caverns that may not even be real, no less!)~
@37545 = ~Would that that were all de Lancie wants of you. Tell <PRO_HIMHER>, Torsin. Tell <CHARNAME> how you would have <PRO_HIMHER> poison the crusade's supplies.~
@37546 = ~No Torsin of Waterdeep could condone an act so devoid of honor.~
@37547 = ~Poisoning the enemy? I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. ~
@37548 = ~No mercy for our enemies. I'll do it. ~
@37549 = ~They would doubtless do the same to us, given the chance. ~
@37550 = ~A convenient position to take, but one with no foundation I can see. ~
@37551 = ~I don't answer to the likes of you, goblin. Why are you here again? Forget it. I don't care. ~
@37552 = ~Oh, grow up. This is war, and in war victory redeems all crimes. ~
@37553 = ~I weary of this argument. Which is why I ensured the poison is non-lethal. It will... distract our enemies. Perhaps convince them some illness is sweeping through their ranks. ~
@37554 = ~No—no! It's not enough. He has to die! Die in the name of Skie Silvershield! Kill him!~ [BD37554]
@37555 = ~Incapacitating an enemy without killing them is an ideal situation. ~
@37556 = ~I still don't like it, but I've done a lot of things I don't like in this life. I'll be able to live with this one.~
@37557 = ~Death is death, and an enemy's death can't come quick or easily enough. I'll poison the crusade's stores if I can—but if I'm going to risk my life, I want to know my victory will take some of theirs. ~
@37558 = ~Hah! I like you, <CHARNAME>. Very well. Here is a concentrated version of the poison. One drop in a barrel of water, three in a crate of potatoes, and all who eat them will die. ~
@37559 = ~This is an evil thing you propose, de Lancie. No good will come of it. ~
@37560 = ~Let history be the judge of that. I doubt it will look unfavorably upon the men and women who ended Caelar's crusade. ~
@37561 = ~Go, then. Do what you're gonna do. It's on your head, and the cityboy's, if it comes back to bite us.~
@37562 = ~I hope you weren't seriously expecting a warm welcome after what occurred at Boareskyr. That doesn't bode well for the mission.~
@37563 = ~You've only told <PRO_HIMHER> part of the mission, de Lancie. Finding the entrance to the caverns is just the first part. ~
@37564 = ~Eh. I'd rather a sword in the chest or even a knife in the back, but I'll not argue this. Go, do what you're gonna do.~
@37565 = ~Here is the poison. One drop in a barrel of water, three in a crate of potatoes, and all who consume them will soon wish they hadn't.~ [BD37565]
@37566 = ~Before you leave, there's a tent near the camp entrance that belongs to a dwarf named Phossey Dugdeep. Go see her; she's been working on something you might find useful as you explore the underground river beneath Dragonspear.~ [BD37566]
@37567 = ~We'll do that. Thank you, sir.~ [BD37567]
@37568 = ~You show the enemy mercy. They would not do the same.~ [BD37568]
@37569 = ~Mercy is not a weakness, friend Dorn. ~
@37570 = ~"Friend"? You go too far, monk.~ [BD37570]
@37571 = ~Cut the dung and pay attention, half-orc. This is important. ~
@37572 = ~And if you can't, there is always the sweet embrace of drink to help us forget our shame, ja? Or is that just Voghiln...?~
@37573 = ~Or is that just Voghiln...? ~
@37574 = ~Well said, <CHARNAME>. ~
@37575 = ~Captain Corwin! Thank the gods!~ [BD37575]
@37576 = ~Steady on, Corporal. What's the problem?~ [BD37576]
@37577 = ~It's Skie Silvershield. She's left the camp.~ [BD37577]
@37578 = ~Do you know where she went? ~
@37579 = ~Well, of course she did. Why wouldn't she? The camp's the only safe, secure, place in the area. Why would she want that? Gods!~
@37580 = ~No great loss. ~
@37581 = ~Lord Silvershield might disagree. Violently. Do we know if Skie left willingly? Or was she taken?~ [BD37581]
@37582 = ~She was last seen heading towards Dragonspear Castle. Alone.~ [BD37582]
@37583 = ~Leave this to me. I'll find and return her before she stumbles into Caelar's grasp.~

@37587 = ~You are disgusting.~ [BD37587]
@37588 = ~Aye, and you are loving it. Ho ho ho!~ [BD37588]
@37589 = ~They don't know who she is. As far as they're concerned, she's just another Flaming Fist. This is bad. This is very bad.~ [BD37589]
@37590 = ~I'll get her back. She was heading towards Dragonspear, you say? ~
@37591 = ~It's even worse than that. You're going to ask me to rescue her, aren't you?~
@37592 = ~She knows of my presence here. If that information should fall into the crusade's hands... Very well. I'll retrieve the witless cow. ~
@37593 = ~That's what the guards tell me. Bring her back safely, <CHARNAME>—if the crusade takes his daughter, Entar Silvershield will have all our heads.~ [BD37593]
@37594 = ~Bring her back safely, <CHARNAME>—if the crusade takes his daughter, Entar Silvershield will have all of our heads.~ [BD37594]
@37595 = ~Girls will be girls.~ [BD37595]
@37596 = ~And rivvin will be idiots.~ [BD37596]
@37597 = ~I'm afraid they WON'T endure it.~ [BD37597]
@37598 = ~Someone has to. Or Silvershield will have all our heads.~ [BD37598]
@37599 = ~Grand Duke Silvershield won't lose his daughter if I've anything to say about it. I'll seek Skie out immediately.~
@37600 = ~My shoulders have become rather attached to my head over the years. You say Skie was heading towards Dragonspear?~
@37601 = ~If Caelar learns of my presence here, it won't be long before I'm dealing with more assassins... Very well. I'll retrieve the witless cow before she falls into the crusade's hands.~
@37602 = ~So the guards say. Bring her back safely, <CHARNAME>. Please.~ [BD37602]
@37603 = ~Try to do it quietly. The fewer people who learn of this, the better.~ [BD37603]
@37604 = ~You may not like her, <CHARNAME>, but such insults are uncalled for. In the future, mind your words.~
@37605 = ~<CHARNAME>, am I glad to see you. ~
@37606 = ~That does not bode well. ~
@37607 = ~That's got to be a first. What's going on? ~
@37608 = ~Would that I could say the same. ~
@37609 = ~I know we've had our differences, but I need your help. Badly. ~
@37610 = ~<CHARNAME>, am I glad to see you. I know we've had our differences, but I need your help. Skie Silvershield's left the camp.~ [BD37610]
@37611 = ~Do you know where she went? ~
@37612 = ~Well, of course she did. Why wouldn't she? The camp's the only safe, secure, place in the area. Why would she want that? Gods!~
@37613 = ~No great loss. ~
@37614 = ~Do you want to be the one to tell Duke Silvershield that? Because I don't.~ [BD37614]
@37615 = ~Perimeter guards said she headed in the direction of Dragonspear Castle.~ [BD37615]
@37616 = ~Leave this to me. I'll find and return her before she stumbles into Caelar's grasp.~
@37617 = ~And they just let her go?~
@37618 = ~She walks right into the clutches of the crusade. Good. Let them endure her endless nattering. ~
@37619 = ~You should not be so callous, <CHARNAME>. The young lady is obviously confused.~ [BD37619]
@37620 = ~Are you sure she's confused? Are you sure she's not just stupid?~ [BD37620]
@37621 = ~Why wouldn't they? ~

@37628 = ~They're more likely to kill her on sight.~ [BD37628]
@37629 = ~So the guards say. Bring her back safely, <CHARNAME>. And try not to attract attention. If word gets out about this—well, I'd rather word not get out about this. Now, go quickly.~ [BD37629]

@37634 = ~I'm just a <PRO_MANWOMAN>. No more and no less than you or any other person in this camp.~
@37635 = ~And a powerful presence it is. Soak it up, friends—I'll not be tarrying long. ~
@37636 = ~I've no time to waste on the likes of you. I understand a woman passed this way—yea tall, long dark hair, exuding an air of unearned entitlement and the exact opposite of intelligence. ~
@37637 = ~Gods, <CHARNAME>. I've met vipers with less venom than you.~ [BD37637]
@37638 = ~The one complaining about her blisters? Aye, she was here. Headed that way, towards Dragonspear.~
@37639 = ~You have my thanks, friend.~
@37640 = ~As you were. ~
@37641 = ~"As you were"? Get gone. I don't answer to you.~
@37642 = ~What a waste. We would wangle wealth from these worms with a wee fee to see thee. Why give it away for free?~ [BD37642]
@37643 = ~Tarry or not, as you will. Makes no difference to me. ~
@37644 = ~I'll leave you to your good work. Farewell.~
@37645 = ~I heard a girl passed this way not too long ago. Dark hair, pouty lips, probably pouty everything else. I don't suppose you've seen her?~
@37646 = ~Tell me, how do you feel? ~
@37647 = ~Confused. Why are you following me? Who are you? ~
@37648 = ~Increasingly agitated. Who are you? ~
@37649 = ~Hungry. Got anything to eat on you? ~
@37650 = ~Angry. How would you feel, awaking to find a strange man standing beside you? ~
@37651 = ~Anger is not without its uses. You must use it to your advantage if you have any hope to control the power within you. ~
@37652 = ~The Lord of Murder's blood flows through my veins. How can I hope to control that? ~
@37653 = ~You've got about ten seconds before you experience my anger unleashed firsthand. Begone. ~
@37654 = ~Hope's given me naught but grief. I abandoned it long ago. ~
@37655 = ~I've become well-acquainted with my anger this past year. You tell me nothing I don't already know. ~
@37656 = ~You sleep, but you do not rest. You thrash about, screaming, lashing out at shadows. For most sleep is a time of peace. But not for you. There can be no peace for those with the blood of Bhaal running through their veins. ~
@37657 = ~The hunger you feel will never be satiated. ~
@37658 = ~I hope you're wrong. ~
@37659 = ~Sure it will. A crust of bread, a little cheese and I'll be good to go. ~
@37660 = ~You know nothing of me. ~
@37661 = ~You believe mocking that which you fear will diminishing its power over you. But you are right to be afraid. I watched over you in your slumber. ~
@37662 = ~You feel anxious? Understandable. I watched over you in your slumber. ~
@37663 = ~You ask the wrong questions. Be not concerned with who I am. What matters is who you are—and what you shall become. ~
@37664 = ~"What" I shall become? ~
@37665 = ~I prefer to live in the moment. If I didn't, I'd most likely become dead. ~
@37666 = ~I shall become what I choose, nothing more or less. ~
@37667 = ~You are the child of Bhaal. Your destiny is written. ~
@37668 = ~There is no fate but the one I make for myself. ~
@37669 = ~Great! That saves me the trouble of having to make a destiny of my own. ~
@37670 = ~Fate is for lesser beings. I make my own destiny. ~
@37671 = ~You fight a battle against your own nature. You cannot win—not on your own. ~
@37672 = ~You can help me escape the shadow of Bhaal? ~
@37673 = ~Fortunately, I won't be fighting it alone. I have friends. ~
@37674 = ~I do not fight my nature. I embrace it. ~
@37675 = ~Others have plans for you. I cannot interfere—not yet. Until Caelar stands in triumph of fallen in defeat, I can offer little. ~
@37676 = ~The future is the one thing that cannot be avoided. No matter what you do, it will find you. You will have to make a decision, or perish. ~
@37677 = ~Fare well. Fare well and we may meet again. ~
@37678 = ~The taint of Bhaal is beyond them—it is beyond you. Dealing with it will require power on a level you've never known. My power. ~
@37679 = ~I know more than you think. I watched over you as you slumber. ~
@37680 = ~To embrace the taint of Bhaal is to welcome the obliteration of the self. <CHARNAME> will cease to be. Are you truly prepared to sacrifice yourself serving your father's ends? ~
@37681 = ~I am my own <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Bhaal is an aspect of me, nothing more. ~
@37682 = ~I'm not inclined to sacrifice myself for anyone's end, my own included. ~
@37683 = ~Only time will tell who will obliterate whom. ~
@37684 = ~The taint of Bhaal can be neither controlled nor denied—not by you. Dealing with it will require power on a level you've never known. My power. ~
@37685 = ~Pride goes before a fall. Continue to believe yourself above and apart from the divine taint within you and you shall fall further than you can imagine. ~
@37686 = ~What other choice do you have? ~
@37687 = ~I'll fight it to my last breath. ~
@37688 = ~I'd like to ignore it. ~
@37689 = ~I could embrace it. ~
@37690 = ~You may be satisfied to let the matter lie, but there are some who will not. Yet there may be a way to end your curse... To remove the Bhaal's stain from your soul for all time. I might be able to do it, were the circumstances other than they are. ~
@37691 = ~You are a long way from Dragonspear Castle. A long way from Caelar. Why do you waste time wandering these dank caverns when you know your enemy is above?~
@37692 = ~There may be a way to reach Caelar from here. I might catch her unawares, or at least sabotage her efforts and minimize the crusade's threat.~
@37693 = ~I serve at the pleasure of the Council of Four. Their representatives asked me to perform a task for them here.~
@37694 = ~You realize you're wandering these caverns too, right? ~
@37695 = ~That's no business of yours. Begone. ~
@37696 = ~You do the will of lesser beings: the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate, the Flaming Fist, the commanders of the Dragonspear siege. Even Caelar—she is not without power, but hers cannot compare to your own.~
@37697 = ~You suppress your own desires in order to fulfill those of others, putting the power of Bhaal in service to mortals. That power will not let itself be misused thus for long. Soon, it will erupt in all its fury.~
@37698 = ~Continue along this path and you and everyone you care for will pay dearly. ~
@37699 = ~These rationalizations may satisfy you—you may even believe them to be true. But the darkness inside you is deaf to your excuses. ~
@37700 = ~I do not wander; I know my purpose. Can you say the same? ~
@37701 = ~Prove yourself worthy of the gifts you possess. Leave this place. Seek out the Shining Lady and do what must be done. As long as she lives, there can be no safe place for you.~
@37702 = ~And here you are, despite my warnings of what would happen if you failed to deal with the taint of Bhaal.~
@37703 = ~How did you get in here? Who ARE you?~
@37704 = ~I don't understand how this happened. Nothing makes sense. ~
@37705 = ~You foresaw my fall but did nothing to stop it. Were I not in this cell, I'd choke the life from you with my bare hands!~
@37706 = ~I am just a man who sought to help you escape a dark fate. I failed. Bhaal's power overwhelmed you. His lust for murder led to Skie Silvershield's death at your hand. You are your father's creature, now and forever.~
@37707 = ~Bhaal's power overwhelmed you. His lust for murder led to Skie Silvershield's death at your hand. ~
@37708 = ~You are your father's creature, now and forever. ~
@37709 = ~But you ARE in a cell. You have ignored the reality of your situation for too long. Now it is inescapable. Bhaal's power overwhelmed you. His lust for murder led to Skie Silvershield's death at your hand.~
@37710 = ~It makes perfect sense. The logic is inescapable, the proof irrefutable. Bhaal's power overwhelmed you. His lust for murder led to Skie Silvershield's death at your hand. You are your father's creature, now and forever.~
@37711 = ~Rise. It is time.~ [BD37711]
@37712 = ~You know what you must do. Embrace the darkness coiling within you.~ [BD37712]
@37713 = ~Take the dagger. Kill her.~ [BD37713]
@37714 = ~Take it.~ [BD37714]
@37715 = ~Even now, you resist. You are more powerful than I thought.~ [BD37715]
@37716 = ~All that I truly require is your presence.~ [BD37716]
@37717 = ~You will have no allies now. No friends to save you. You will be cast out, as all who threaten the natural order are cast out.~ [BD37717]
@37718 = ~When that happens, we shall meet again.~ [BD37718]
@37719 = ~Curious. Your mind is not so open to me as it once was—you resist my will. Your power grows, child of Bhaal.~ [BD37719]
@37720 = ~Tell me. What did you see?~ [BD37720]
@37721 = ~I saw Skie Silvershield die. I saw the face of her killer. ~
@37722 = ~It was you. You killed Skie Silvershield—you set me up!~
@37723 = ~I saw your death. ~
@37724 = ~Despite my efforts, you remember. Impressive.~ [BD37724]
@37725 = ~I'll show you impressive, mage. When I escape, I am coming for you.~
@37726 = ~The truth will come out. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but soon.~
@37727 = ~I'll find a way out of here. And when I do, I'll find you. The day is coming, fiend. Your end is nearer than you know.~
@37728 = ~There are few more acutely aware of their own vulnerability than I, I assure you.~ [BD37728]
@37729 = ~You will escape this place. We will meet again. Fear that meeting, child of Bhaal. We have so far to go together.~ [BD37729]
@37730 = ~An inevitability, perhaps—but your eyes tell me another story. What did you SEE?~ [BD37730]
@37731 = ~You killed Skie Silvershield. I won't let you get away with it. ~
@37732 = ~I'll do you one better than telling you. When the time comes, I'll show you, you traitorous bastard!~
@37733 = ~I saw you die, screaming, at my hand. I looked down at your corpse and laughed, for my vengeance was complete. You had paid for your crimes against me—paid for Skie Silvershield's murder with your own wretched life!~
@37734 = ~Greater powers than you have challenged me, yet I still stand.~ [BD37734]
@37735 = ~Of that, I have no doubt.~ [BD37735]
@37736 = ~You are more powerful than I dared hope. But no matter. Sleep now. We must begin a long journey together. ~
@37737 = ~A happy worker's a more productive worker, Betror. That's a fact. I can prove it with numbers.~ [BD37737]
@37738 = ~Rhonda! Good t'see ya.~ [BD37738]
@37739 = ~I was wondering if you could do me a little favor. My cousin here needs to get up to the basement.~ [BD37739]
@37740 = ~Sure, no problem. Have him 'n his friends hop on.~ [BD37740]
@37741 = ~Sure, no problem. Have him 'n his friend hop on.~ [BD37741]
@37742 = ~Belben say no takin' people up without permission.~ [BD37742]

@37744 = ~Thanks, I'll do that. ~
@37745 = ~I'd like to get a better look 'round this place first, if that's all right. ~
@37746 = ~You have my thanks, ogres. And you, Rhonda. Stay safe. ~
@37747 = ~I will, Glint. You just make sure you do the same.~ [BD37747]
@37748 = ~You do whatever you want. No trouble to me.~ [BD37748]
@37749 = ~Thanks, boys.~

@37763 = ~Let me be blunt here: I need to get up into the castle. There must be something I can do to get you to give that wheel a turn or two on my behalf.~
@37764 = ~I'll put this plainly: Lift me up on your platform or I swear by every god that's ever lived I will kill you both and laugh while doing it.~
@37765 = ~Ya. Hop onna platform. We getcha where you goin'.~ [BD37765]

@37927 = ~A surprise, then, but not an unpleasant one, I hope. Certainly not once you hear what I've got to say. ~
@37928 = ~Fair enough. It was about the last place I ever expected to be. Looking on the bright side, though, I didn't come alone. ~
@37929 = ~It was an inevitable step on my path to wipe Caelar and her damnable crusade from the face of Faerûn. ~
@37930 = ~Jaheira lives? Th-thank the gods. I was s-so worried about her. But sure you had another purpose in coming here?~

@37947 = ~It's that bad? I'll go see your people—perhaps I can do something to improve morale.~
@37948 = ~As y-you wish. But don't expect much. S-start with Wynan H-hess. He's sh-shielded us from the cru—the crusade's magic thus far. You should find him in—in the fort, at the back.~
@37949 = ~What will the sign be? ~
@37950 = ~The Fist will attack from the southwest. Watch for movement in that part of the crusade camp. ~
@37951 = ~You'll know it when you see it, believe me. ~
@37952 = ~Screaming, Khalid. The sign will be the screams of crusaders, dying by the score. ~
@37953 = ~Oh. All—all right. B-before you do anything, though, y-you should probably talk to the magician Wy-wynan Hess. He's the b-best magician in the f-fort—he kept us safe—mostly safe from the crusade's magic. He'll be in-inside, at the back.~
@37954 = ~As y-you wish. But don't expect much. S-start with Wynan H-hess. He's sh-shielded us from the cru—the crusade's magic thus far. You should find him in-in the fort, at the back. When y-you've decided your next m-m-move, come and let me know.~
@37955 = ~Forgive me, my friend. I didn't think. Your people will be free soon. Get them ready and await the sign to strike. ~
@37956 = ~Do what you need to do. Just make sure you don't get in my way when I do the same. ~

@37965 = ~As you w-wish. ~
@37966 = ~You've brought help? ~
@37967 = ~A camp of Flaming Fist mercenaries a few miles the south await my word. We will smash the crusaders 'twixt your people and mine. ~
@37968 = ~Jaheira and fifty others stand ready to strike. All you need to do is be ready and wait for the sign. ~
@37969 = ~Yes. Not that I couldn't handle the crusaders myself. ~
@37970 = ~You would face Caelar? Jaheira w-won't be happy with that. ~
@37971 = ~She may not approve, but she lets me make my own decisions. ~
@37972 = ~She isn't. I'll make it up to her by reuniting you. ~
@37973 = ~Making Jaheira happy is a husband's job, not mine. I've fifty seasoned Flaming Fist mercenaries awaiting my word. We will smash the crusaders 'twixt your people and mine. ~
@37974 = ~I'm afraid Jaheira's no long in a position to care one way or the other. ~
@37975 = ~With a little help from your... friends. ~
@37976 = ~Are you seeking Caelar alone? ~
@37977 = ~No. More than two score Flaming Fist mercenaries are camped nearby. ~
@37978 = ~No. I've Corwin here, a Flaming Fist company, and others waiting to strike a blow against the crusade. ~
@37979 = ~I can handle the Caelar's minions. ~
@37980 = ~N-now? ~
@37981 = ~A Flaming Fist company waits nearby. As soon as we attack, they'll move to help us. ~
@37982 = ~The longer we wait, the greater the risk of crusade reinforcements arriving. ~
@37983 = ~Now. ~
@37984 = ~We need no assistance. The crusaders shall fall before us like blades of grass beneath the scythe. ~
@37985 = ~Very well. I'll summon everyone, and... we'll do this. ~
@37986 = ~A quick confrontation could cool the crusaders' characteristic contrariness. ~
@37987 = ~How soon can you mobilize your troops? ~
@37988 = ~Calling them troops may be a little g-generous. But what they lack in discipline, they make up with det-determination. ~
@37989 = ~Well, get them ready and wait for the sign. ~
@37990 = ~I'm surprised they haven't done so already. ~
@37991 = ~We need to hit them before they hit us. Gather your people. It's time to strike a blow against the crusade. ~
@37992 = ~I think they're hoping you'll burn the fort down without their having to get involved. ~
@37993 = ~They're hoping to starve you out. Secure a surrender without bloodshed. ~
@37994 = ~If I could ensure the safety of the people here, I'd gladly surrender the fort. ~
@37995 = ~Thou art in charge of Bridgefort's defense! What sort of talk is that?~
@37996 = ~Caelar's people already control Boareskyr Bridge. They'll find little of use in these walls. Certainly nothing worth dying over—for either side. ~
@37997 = ~Perhaps I can arrange a peaceful surrender. ~
@37998 = ~Crusades are not renowned for sensibility. Force is the only language they'll understand. ~
@37999 = ~Yet many will die to hold this place—and soon. Gather your forces. We're taking the battle to the crusaders.~
@38000 = ~Or perhaps we could kick their butts! Now THAT is a plan Minsc could get behind. ~
@38001 = ~Sensibility? Overrated. ~
@38002 = ~I just want these people's lives sp-spared. Do you think you can do that? ~
@38003 = ~I can try. ~
@38004 = ~Your people aren't leaving here without a fight. Fortunately, I've brought friends. Gather your forces and wait for the sign. This is where we break the crusade. ~
@38005 = ~I could, but I won't. You've been on the defensive too long. Gather your forces. We're taking the battle to the crusade. ~
@38006 = ~Can you leave the fort undetected? ~
@38007 = ~I'll manage. ~
@38008 = ~Ehh... I was hoping you could help me out with that. ~
@38009 = ~If I wished. But if we're going to negotiate a surrender, there's no reason for subterfuge. Take me to the main gate. ~
@38010 = ~B-before we n-negotiate, you should s-speak with the wizard Wy-wynan Hess. Inside the f-f-fort, at the back, you'll f-find him. He's shielded us f-from the worst of the c-c-crusade's magic. How much longer he c-can do so will surely af-affect our bargaining p-position.~
@38011 = ~With the wild mage in here, that's a d-distinct possibility. ~
@38012 = ~I'm proud of you, Khalid. You've done well here. ~
@38013 = ~She's right. But you'll soon do better. ~
@38014 = ~Holding the fort in the face of the crusade is impressive. Would you mind if I took a look around? ~
@38015 = ~She's too kind. Why haven't you taken the battle to the crusade? ~
@38016 = ~W-we have been hard-pressed just to d-defend the fort. ~
@38017 = ~It is the crusade that will be hard-pressed now that mighty Voghiln fights at your side. ~
@38018 = ~You do not know what Khalid had to work with here, <CHARNAME>. I do. That he has held the fort is nigh miraculous. ~
@38019 = ~I'd like to look around and see what he's been working with for myself. ~
@38020 = ~Holding the fort is impressive, but we need to do more than that if we're to cross Boareskyr Bridge. How are your people doing? Are they able to fight?~
@38021 = ~That it has been held with him in command is miraculous indeed. But the time to hold the fort is past. The crusade is ill-prepared for an assault. ~
@38022 = ~I'm sure w-word of your arrival's spread through the fort b-by now. If-if-if anyone interf-feres with you, just come see me. ~
@38023 = ~Come with us, Khalid. It's been too long since I've been in your company. ~
@38024 = ~A good idea. Join us. ~
@38025 = ~I'm sure he's much to do, but if you'd rather stay with Khalid than come with me, I'll understand. ~
@38026 = ~I've no interest in listening to this stammering buffoon. ~
@38027 = ~Of course. ~
@38028 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. We'll speak again soon, I'm sure. ~
@38029 = ~That stammering buffoon is my husband, <CHARNAME>. ~
@38030 = ~D-don't make a fuss, darling. Y-you have to go with <PRO_HIMHER>. We made a p-promise to Gorion. ~
@38031 = ~...Very well. Let's go see the fort, then. ~
@38032 = ~There are fifty fighters camped less than a mile to the east, ready to take the battle to the crusade. ~
@38033 = ~Now is the time for Bridgefort to take its revenge upon Caelar's disciples. ~
@38034 = ~Await the sign, Khalid. The crusaders' screams will mark the start of the battle for Bridgefort. ~
@38035 = ~The question is, are you? ~
@38036 = ~I'll get my p-people ready. ~
@38037 = ~My people have been beaten down for I don't know h-how long. I don't know how much more they have to give. ~
@38038 = ~Perhaps there's another way to end this. We could try to negotiate. ~
@38039 = ~May we take a look around? See exactly what we have to work with when it comes to fighting the crusade? ~
@38040 = ~They've been beaten down? Then lift them back up, man. Bridgefort's vengeance is at hand.~
@38041 = ~Negotiate with those zealots? Ridiculous. ~
@38042 = ~Yes, well. Not EVERYONE here attempted to slaughter their priest. ~
@38043 = ~It pains to me to say it, but the half-orc's right. Has anyone else seen any indication that the crusade is willing to bargain? Because I haven't. ~
@38044 = ~Maybe, m-maybe such a thing is p-possible. By all-all accounts the crusade commander is an hon-honorable man, if a fearf-ful one. Enjoy what little h-hospitality the fort can p-provide while I th-think on this.~
@38045 = ~I can try. ~
@38046 = ~If you're willing to leave your supplies here, there's a chance I can talk them into letting your people go. ~
@38047 = ~Of course I could. But if the choice is between talking to the enemy or killing them, I know what I would choose. ~
@38048 = ~Another pointless battle. Joy. ~
@38049 = ~I don't know that I like our ch-chances, <CHARNAME>. But say the word and I'll have the drawbridge lowered. If we must die, let it be in battle! ~
@38050 = ~In battle at my side, you mean. ~
@38051 = ~Of course, d-dear. I'd have it n-no other way. ~
@38052 = ~Come with us, Khalid. We'll face the enemy together. ~
@38053 = ~Jaheira, you'll stay with me. Khalid, you go rally your people. The battle for Bridgefort begins now! ~
@38054 = ~I would. You have proven yourself useful to me, Jaheira. Your husband has not. Until he does, he's naught to me but excess weight. ~
@38055 = ~As you wish. ~
@38056 = ~Victory or d-d-death! ~
@38057 = ~Have a care, <CHARNAME>. You're talking about the man I love. ~
@38058 = ~D-don't make a fuss, darling. Y-you have to go with <PRO_HIMHER>. We made a p-promise to Gorion. ~
@38059 = ~...You are right, Khalid. But when this is over, we WILL be together again. ~
@38060 = ~Then let us end it quickly. ~
@38061 = ~And my people are ill-prepared f-for a fight. ~
@38062 = ~Do it, then. Please. Even with your help, I fear we could n-not repel the crusade if they attack ag-again. ~
@38063 = ~Come with me. We're going to talk to the crusade.~
@38064 = ~Gather your people together and prepare. If negotiations fail, battle will be our only option. ~
@38065 = ~The crusade should be worried about repelling us, not the other way around. ~
@38066 = ~As you w-wish. ~
@38067 = ~I'll get them ready. ~
@38068 = ~Good work. We've still got fighting in the east and west, but the bulk of Caelar's forces have been routed.~ [BD38068]
@38069 = ~Glad to hear it. What now? ~
@38070 = ~Not a moment too soon. Arguably several minutes too late, but that's water under the bridge. ~
@38071 = ~Save the compliments, Nederlok. Tell me what I want to hear: Tell me we're taking the battle to Caelar's door. ~
@38072 = ~Let us not take battle only to the door, but to the entire castle!~ [BD38072]
@38073 = ~The crusade's falling back into Dragonspear. We'll never have a better chance of finishing this than we do now. Get what you need from the camp and rendezvous with the siege commanders at Dragonspear's gates.~ [BD38073]

@38075 = ~N-now we end this. ~
@38076 = ~Our soldiers return, Hephernaan. What news do you bring me? ~
@38077 = ~The first battle is lost, my lady. Our forces fall back to the castle even now.~

@38362 = ~Peace and justice are all well and good, but I will have my revenge before this is done.~
@38363 = ~Remember this, then. When everything's said and done, you had a chance. You could have stood in the light. You choose darkness. You will pay for it.~ [BD38363]
@38364 = ~You could have walked with me in the light, but you chose blood and darkness. You will pay for that.~ [BD38364]
@38365 = ~You ask me to surrender now, when I stand on the threshold of victory? No! I will not stop now. I cannot!~ [BD38365]
@38366 = ~This one'll be a touch easier—fewer arrows flying at my bloody head!~
@38367 = ~All right boys and girls, have at 'em. I'll be back at the camp drinking myself into a stupor. *hic* Haha!~
@38368 = ~Everyone spread out to make sure the courtyard doesn't hold any surprises.~ [BD38368]
@38369 = ~I'm going into the Castle.~
@38370 = ~What can I do?~
@38371 = ~Where's Caelar? I want to parade her cold corpse through camp.~
@38372 = ~Go. We'll be right behind you.~ [BD38372]
@38373 = ~Caelar's in the castle. Go in; we'll be right behind you.~ [BD38373]
@38374 = ~She's fallen back into the castle. Go find her; we'll be right behind you.~ [BD38374]
@38375 = ~What're you waiting for? Take the castle, godsdamnit!~ [BD38375]
@38376 = ~When you're in the castle, keep an eye out for Skie. We still don't know what happened to her.~ [BD38376]
@38377 = ~We'll secure the courtyard. You head into the castle.~ [BD38377]
@38378 = ~Coalition or crusade? Coalition? Well, what're you standing around for, then? Take the castle!~
@38379 = ~You're still here? I'd have thought the hero of Baldur's Gate would be storming the castle by now.~ [BD38379]
@38380 = ~The courtyard's under control. Head into the Castle.~
@38381 = ~Be about your business, soldier.~
@38382 = ~Aren't you supposed to be in the castle?~
@38383 = ~Dragonspear awaits, "hero."~
@38384 = ~Where's Marshal Nederlok?~

@38389 = ~Die inside it, you bloody fool!~
@38390 = ~The light shines upon me now. I shall not falter. I swear Caelar's enemies will go no farther.~
@38391 = ~No farther!~
@38392 = ~We're with you, Alachi! Death to the darkness!~
@38393 = ~Idiots! Do as you will, then. I'll not risk my life for the likes of you.~

@38403 = ~These crusaders make better rugs than doorways, ja?~
@38404 = ~You should not have stood against us.~
@38405 = ~Can these crusaders do anything but yell and die? How dreadfully tedious.~
@38406 = ~What a shallow sham of a show. Come now, crusaders! Supply slightly more spunk, a smidgen less skedaddle; what do you say?~
@38407 = ~Let's go, let's go!~

@38415 = ~Ysseth Dareeli answers to no one but Caelar.~
@38416 = ~We all answer to the gods in the end.~
@38417 = ~Ysseth Dareeli will answer to me.~
@38418 = ~Then Ysseth Dareeli will die.~
@38419 = ~We shall see. Righteous Soldiers—take them!~
@38420 = ~And his mistress will soon follow.~
@38421 = ~True enough. When that day comes, I know I shall find their favor as I have Caelar's. Can you say the same? I think not. Righteous servants of the Shining Lady—take <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@38422 = ~Oh, for the love of all the gods, Hephernaan, what is it now—? Wait. You're not Hephernaan. Who are you?~
@38423 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. Can you tell me anything of the man who lives here?~
@38424 = ~Who are you?~
@38425 = ~Do not take that tone with me, dwarf.~
@38426 = ~Mind your tone, ghost. You speak to the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@38427 = ~Baldur's Gate? That den of pirates and thieves has a hero? Since when?~
@38428 = ~Since I defeated Sarevok.~
@38429 = ~Much has changed since you lived, I think. You don't know what Baldur's Gate became. Names like Belt and Silvershield and Sarevok mean nothing to you.~
@38430 = ~A man named Sarevok schemed to overthrow the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate. I stopped him.~
@38431 = ~Sarevok. Hephernaan has spoken this name, from time to time...~
@38432 = ~Wait. Are you the child of Bhaal?~
@38433 = ~You know of me?~
@38434 = ~In the flesh.~
@38435 = ~The one and only, now that Sarevok is dead.~
@38436 = ~The man who TRESPASSES here, you mean. Aye, I can tell you about Hephernaan. He's not what he seems. He plays the pious priest, oh yes, he plays it well—but I hear him in the night, him and his servants, speaking to their dark master.~
@38437 = ~What does this dark master want?~
@38438 = ~Dark master? Hephernaan serves Caelar Argent.~
@38439 = ~Tell me what you know, dwarf.~
@38440 = ~Tell me all that you know.~
@38441 = ~I'm no mage. Sounded like vague nonsense to me. They were always on about divine blood, getting the child of some dead murder god to come here...~
@38442 = ~I am the child of Bhaal.~
@38443 = ~They WANTED me to come here?~
@38444 = ~If that was their goal, they succeeded, for I am here.~
@38445 = ~You? You're the Bhaalspawn? You must leave this place, immediately.~
@38446 = ~Would that I could, but honor demands that Caelar Argent's threat be ended, once and for all time.~
@38447 = ~Yeah, all right. That works for me.~
@38448 = ~I'm not leaving—not until Caelar has paid for her sins.~
@38449 = ~Hephernaan serves Caelar the way a chef serves a meal. I don't know who his true master is, but I've heard them speak, Hephernaan at his altar and his master somewhere else, far from here.~
@38450 = ~Don't be a fool. Hephernaan brought you here for a reason. Go, now. Flee Dragonspear Castle before Hephernaan gets his claws into you.~
@38451 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate is here?~
@38452 = ~You know of me?~
@38453 = ~In the flesh.~
@38454 = ~I just said as much.~
@38455 = ~You're all Hephernaan and his dark master have spoken of of late.~
@38456 = ~Truly? What have they said?~
@38457 = ~Hephernaan serves Caelar. Who is this dark master you speak of?~
@38458 = ~Tell me what you know, dwarf.~
@38459 = ~Tell me all that you know.~
@38460 = ~Go, now. Flee Dragonspear Castle before Hephernaan gets his claws into you.~
@38461 = ~I'm no mage. Sounded like a buncha vague nonsense to me. But they want you here, badly, which is more than reason enough to leave. Go, now. Flee Dragonspear Castle before Hephernaan gets his claws into you.~
@38462 = ~I'm Daeros bloody Dragonspear, that's who I am! You're in my home. Who in the Hells are you?~
@38463 = ~Well met, Daeros Dragonspear. I am <CHARNAME>. Is there anything you can tell me of the man who lives here?~
@38464 = ~Daeros Dragonspear? I thought you were a dwarf.~
@38465 = ~This castle belongs to Caelar now, though not for much longer. She will fall before me, the same as Sarevok.~
@38466 = ~A dwarf. You think me a dwarf? Any other asinine comments you'd like to make?~
@38467 = ~You damned fool, you've marched right into the dragon's mouth! Go, now, flee Dragonspear before Hephernaan gets his claws into you!~
@38468 = ~That was no dwarf.~
@38469 = ~Still here? You damned fool, I told you to get out. You're in danger!~
@38470 = ~It's strange to be so close to her. Finally, we get a chance to end this once and for all.~ [BD38470]
@38471 = ~It's nearly over, <CHARNAME>. Caelar retreated into this vault. There's no way out. Our mage reports a strange magical aura behind the door—we've got to be careful. Are you ready for the final battle?~ [BD38471]
@38472 = ~And so we reach the end of a long, long journey. If you only knew the sacrifices I made to bring us to this point. All of them worthwhile.~ [BD38472]
@38473 = ~Change is upon us. Great and righteous change. You've come to face me, so do so! Now is our time.~ [BD38473]
@38474 = ~You'll find out soon enough, my puppet, once the devils begin their march into this world. Bleed, Bhaalspawn. Bleed for my master.~ [BD38474]
@38475 = ~Hephernaan... what have you done? I will not let him corrupt our work by bringing forth an army of fiends! Crusaders, with me!~ [BD38475]
@38476 = ~HEPHERNAAN!~
@38477 = ~You're outnumbered, Bence! Go for reinforcements, now!~ [BD38477]
@38478 = ~Gods help us all, they've opened the portal to the Nine Hells! Out, everyone! Get out and get the vault door locked NOW!~ [BD38478]
@38479 = ~Sir? What about...?~
@38480 = ~Leave them. There's no time—we have to secure the vault immediately! Devils could flood this place any second!~ [BD38480]
@38481 = ~What has happened?~
@38482 = ~You would know better than I.~
@38483 = ~Caelar's priest laid us low. All of us, your mistress included.~
@38484 = ~You were betrayed.~
@38485 = ~They're not alone in that.~
@38486 = ~Closing the vault was the right move. De Lancie couldn't risk something escaping Avernus. ~
@38487 = ~That is doubtlessly true. Even so, he might have done us the courtesy of getting us out of it before locking it up.~
@38488 = ~So... What do we do now?~
@38489 = ~That is up to you.~
@38490 = ~I could use something to eat.~
@38491 = ~You die. I kill you, then proceed to Avernus to do the same to Caelar.~
@38492 = ~We have no argument with you. We never have.~
@38493 = ~Yet the woman you served ordered my death. She nearly killed my oldest friend.~
@38494 = ~No argument? Caelar tried to have me killed.~
@38495 = ~Unfortunately, I do have an argument with you—but not for much longer, I think.~
@38496 = ~Not killed—kidnapped. You were no good to her dead. She needed divine blood. 'Tis the key that unlocks the door to Hell.~ [BD38496]
@38497 = ~Divine blood. 'Tis the key that unlocks the door to Hell.~
@38498 = ~And we delivered it right to her. Or, more accurately, her stooge.~ [BD38498]
@38499 = ~I swore I would follow Caelar into Avernus. And I will.~
@38500 = ~As will I.~
@38501 = ~As will we all.~
@38502 = ~We go together, then. Glory to the Shining Lady!~
@38503 = ~Hephernaan betrayed us.~
@38504 = ~He could have killed us all. Caelar could have killed me. Why didn't they?~
@38505 = ~There seems to be a lot of betrayal going around today.~
@38506 = ~And he will pay a heavy price for that betrayal.~
@38507 = ~I no longer know Hephernaan's motives. But Caelar never wanted you dead. She wanted—needed your blood, blood of the divine. The key that unlocks the door to Hell.~
@38508 = ~Vile cur! You have tainted Toril for too long. It ends now!~
@38509 = ~She never wanted you dead—you'd be little use to her that way. All she wanted was your blood.~
@38510 = ~Vampire!~
@38511 = ~Hardly. She didn't want any blood—just <CHARNAME>'s. Divine blood. It's the key that unlocked this gate to Hell.~
@38512 = ~Who's that? Who's there?~ [BD38512]
@38513 = ~De Lancie? What are you doing out there? It's me, <CHARNAME>.~
@38514 = ~Oh great. On top of everything else I have to deal with you now.~
@38515 = ~Baalzebul, Archduke of Maladomini, the Fallen One.~
@38516 = ~Open the damned door!~
@38517 = ~Is it wise to joke about such things, my friend?~ [BD38517]
@38518 = ~Glad you're still alive, <CHARNAME>.~
@38519 = ~The portal to Avernus is open, de Lancie.~
@38520 = ~As am I. I'd be more glad if I were alive and on that side of the door.~
@38521 = ~Unlock this door. NOW.~
@38522 = ~Corporal Duncan summoned the commanders when the portal opened. We have to keep the vault locked for now. Devils could easily overwhelm the castle otherwise. I'm sure you understand.~ [BD38522]
@38523 = ~I have no intention of leaving this vault, not till I see the portal closed. Farewell, Torsin de Lancie. Gods willing, we will meet again.~
@38524 = ~The portal? It's closed. You can let us out now.~
@38525 = ~Let me out of here, damn you!~
@38526 = ~Would that I could, my friend. But I cannot.~
@38527 = ~We need to close that portal.~ [BD38527]
@38528 = ~Are you certain of that, Captain? Because I'm reasonably sure we should be getting as far away from that damned portal as possible.~
@38529 = ~As far as possible is not far at all, in this instance.~ [BD38529]
@38530 = ~Who is it I have the honor of addressing...? I'm afraid I don't recognize your voice.~ [BD38530]
@38531 = ~De Lancie? What are you doing out there? It's me, <CHARNAME>.~
@38532 = ~You know, de Lancie, as a jester, you make a fine military strategist.~
@38533 = ~You'll recognize my face, you pompous jackass! It'll be the last thing you see before you die!~
@38534 = ~I saw. What are you going to do?~
@38535 = ~Find a way to close it.~
@38536 = ~The only sensible thing I can do—run from this place as far and as fast as I can.~
@38537 = ~Let me out of here and we can discuss our next move.~
@38538 = ~The fate of Toril is in your hands. May the gods smile upon you.~ [BD38538]
@38539 = ~Such obvious deception will fool no one, not even the monkeys outside. Anyone with the slightest sensitivity can feel the infernal power of the First Hell radiating out from this place.~
@38540 = ~It galls me to admit it, but the Thayan's right.~
@38541 = ~My mages tell me the portal is open. And for as long as that remains the case, these doors are staying closed. You must find a way to seal this rift between planes.~ [BD38541]

@38553 = ~Me happier not being beaten, so no more resting talk! Got it?~ [BD38553]
@38554 = ~What?! Who that there?~ [BD38554]
@38555 = ~Hello, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. What we do for you this fine day?~ [BD38555]
@38556 = ~Did I hear you say someone's been beating you? That's appalling. Unforgivable.~
@38557 = ~Well met, gentlemen. How does this <DAYNIGHTALL> find you? It is <DAYNIGHTALL>, right? It's hard to tell down here.~
@38558 = ~I need lifting up. I'm on urgent crusade business. See, I hold the crest of Caelar.~
@38559 = ~I wish to be raised up.~
@38560 = ~I just heard you say you're happier not being beaten. That's excellent. I'll be happy not to thrash you—provided you transport me up on your lift.~
@38561 = ~You can turn that wheel and send me where I want to go, and quickly.~
@38562 = ~You don't smell like crusader.~ [BD38562]

@38564 = ~I assure you I am.~
@38565 = ~Smells can be deceiving, my imposingly hairy friend. Here, I have Caelar's seal.~
@38566 = ~You think your nose is more reliable than trained crusade soldiers? How would I even be here if I weren't a loyal follower of Caelar?~
@38567 = ~And if I admitted I wasn't? What would you do then, you loyal servants of Caelar, all glory be unto her?~
@38568 = ~Stupid Einer. They got the Shining Lady's seal. "Doesn't smell like crusader," what kind of talk is that?~ [BD38568]
@38569 = ~Einer not very smart. Hop on, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. We take you up.~ [BD38569]
@38570 = ~Hop on, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. We take you up.~ [BD38570]
@38571 = ~That's what me said. With shorter words.~ [BD38571]
@38572 = ~Most of you kind do, don't you? But wait...~ [BD38572]
@38573 = ~We not take anyone up without Belben saying so.~ [BD38573]
@38574 = ~I bear the Shining Lady's seal. Is that permission enough?~

@38576 = ~Belben said I could go up. He said it wouldn't be a problem.~
@38577 = ~I'M giving you permission.~

@38582 = ~Belben say lotta things. Me want drink. You got anything to beat my thirst, <PRO_RACE>?~ [BD38582]
@38583 = ~I do, actually. I found several bottles of wine lying around.~

@38585 = ~I'll beat YOU to a bloody pulp if you don't do your damned job and get me up into the castle.~
@38586 = ~Well, hand 'em over!~ [BD38586]

@38608 = ~Where is this Belben?~
@38609 = ~I don't want to hurt you, ogre. I do, however, want to kill you.~
@38610 = ~A dill-what?~ [BD38610]
@38611 = ~I think they saying Belben up there and they down here, so is hard to get Belben to tell you to let them go up because to get Belben they have to go up, an' you won't let them up 'less Belben say so.~ [BD38611]
@38612 = ~Hn. That IS stumper. Good luck wit' that.~ [BD38603]

@38616 = ~I need to get into the castle.~
@38617 = ~Turn the wheel, you primitive brute. Raise me up into Dragonspear.~

@38619 = ~When I've done what I need to do above, I'll return and free you.~
@38620 = ~I've got money.~

@38622 = ~Right. An' if you die up there, where that leave us? Right where we were, that where, getting beaten even worse for good measure. No, no. You have to give me somethin' before me send you up. Get me some wine. Then we talk.~ [BD38622]
@38623 = ~We could do it easy enough. But...~
@38624 = ~Money don't mean much down here. Whatcha got to drink?~ [BD38624]
@38625 = ~Aye. The soldiers down here get plenty of wine. They act high 'n mighty, but they like their drink as much as next ogre. Hint hint.~ [BD38625]
@38626 = ~I'll get you some wine and return shortly.~
@38627 = ~Turn the wheel and send me up to Dragonspear or I'll take your thrice-damned head off, ogre. Hint hint.~

@38630 = ~An enemy.~
@38631 = ~Right, an emmeny! Pray to whatever god you've got—ye're about to meet 'em!~
@38632 = ~Don't say "we gotta kill you now," Betror. Bad enough we stuck here turnin' this wheel. I don't wanna fight crusade's battles for it as well.~ [BD38632]
@38633 = ~That does it. Y'wanna go up, <PRO_RACE>? Me like to see you try it with your arms and legs tore off!~ [BD38633]
@38634 = ~And if you Belben, that permission worth somethin'. But you not, so shove off before something gets shoved off for you.~ [BD38634]
@38635 = ~If I understand you correctly then, you're willing to surrender your troops and abandon Dragonspear Castle. All we have to do is give you the Bhaalspawn.~ [BD38635]
@38636 = ~You better not be considering this offer, de Lancie. We all know you're a coward—don't be a traitor too.~ [BD38636]
@38637 = ~You understand my position, then. I need the child of Bhaal, but only for a short time. I shall return them safe, unharmed, within the week and disperse my troops from Dragonspear Castle.~ [BD38637]
@38638 = ~With all respect due, how can we trust you're bargaining in good faith?~
@38639 = ~You doubt my sincerity?~
@38640 = ~You would too, in our boots.~
@38641 = ~Ah. Speak of a devil and <PRO_HESHE> shall appear. It is good to see you again, <CHARNAME>. Please, join us.~
@38642 = ~What's going on here?~
@38643 = ~Said the spider to the fly.~
@38644 = ~Negotiation is for bureaucrats and cowards. When it's time to do battle, let me know. I'll be in the camp till then.~
@38645 = ~I only intended to clarify the offer, Stonehand. No need for accusations. Ah, <CHARNAME>, there you are. We've only just started negotiations.~ [BD38645]
@38646 = ~Any progress?~
@38647 = ~Then by all means, continue.~
@38648 = ~The only way this ends is with blood. Caelar's light WILL be snuffed out for all time.~
@38649 = ~I think there are some promising avenues we can explore.~ [BD38649]
@38650 = ~She wants you, <CHARNAME>. She says she'll disband her army and surrender if you go with her. Sounds too good to be true, doesn't it?~ [BD38650]
@38651 = ~Three days to finish my business. That's all it will take. Come with me, <CHARNAME>. March beside me into Avernus. Together we shall liberate the souls of those lost in the Dragonspear Wars.~
@38652 = ~You can't go with that madwoman, <CHARNAME>.~
@38653 = ~We're not going to let you take <PRO_HIMHER>, Caelar.~
@38654 = ~Watch your back, <CHARNAME>. De Lancie seems to think you're a chip to bargained away in these discussions...~
@38655 = ~I'll keep an eye on <PRO_HIMHER>, sir. Let's go, <CHARNAME>.~
@38656 = ~Listen to me, <CHARNAME>. The lost souls of the Dragonspear dead need a hero. That hero is you. Join me, and together we shall liberate the souls trapped in the Nine Hells.~ [BD38656]
@38657 = ~You make a strong case for aiding you. I admit I'm tempted.~
@38658 = ~You're up to something, Caelar. If it were that simple you would have just asked for my help instead of drumming up an army and sending assassins after me.~
@38659 = ~I may very well join you in the Hells, Caelar—but I will never stand at your side.~
@38660 = ~Please! There's no need for such inflammatory language. We're all working toward the same end here.~ [BD38660]
@38661 = ~Time is now our enemy. If someone else seeks the Bhaalspawn... I cannot wait any longer for you to see the light. What will not be given freely must be taken.~ [BD38661]
@38662 = ~As you command, my lady.~ [BD38662]
@38663 = ~When next you see my banner, it will be at the head of the army that marches on you. For righteousness. For justice.~ [BD38663]
@38664 = ~Unpalatable compromises must sometimes be made, for the greater good.~ [BD38664]
@38665 = ~If it will help end this madness, I will go with Caelar.~
@38666 = ~Ordinarily I'm all for cooperation, but I don't think we have the whole story here. I'm not going anywhere with you.~
@38667 = ~Caelar Argent doesn't "cooperate." Nor shall I.~
@38668 = ~You know nothing of me, godling. You have no idea of the compromises I've made, the people I lost, to stand here today. If you did, you would not be so quick to condemn me.~ [BD38668]
@38669 = ~I told you, my lady. Boareskyr Bridge was an omen. This—this person cannot be trusted. You cannot rely on them to do the right thing.~ [BD38669]
@38670 = ~We know you would. But it's too dangerous.~ [BD38670]
@38671 = ~If it'll save the troops—~ [BD38671]
@38672 = ~What Caelar plans for the hero may be worse than loss of life. I understand your position, Stonehand, but you must see that cooperation could end in a bigger disaster than a battle.~ [BD38672]
@38673 = ~It is.~
@38674 = ~It pains me to say it, but Nederlok is right. This time. Though I'd happily sacrifice the Bhaalspawn's life to end this war, we don't know what sending <PRO_HIMHER> off with Caelar means. ~
@38675 = ~It pains me to say it, but Nederlok is right. This time. Though I'd happily sacrifice the Bhaalspawn's life to end this war, we don't know what sending them off with Caelar means.~ [BD38675]
@38676 = ~I still think surrender is the best option. I'd gladly give my life to save those around me.~
@38677 = ~Thank you for the touching display of support, de Lancie.~
@38678 = ~Darkness awaits you, lady ssussun.~ [BD38678]
@38679 = ~Ahdzekharrin, you faithless cur! I should cut you down where you stand!~
@38680 = ~It is good to see you again, Edwin. My mood has been bleak of late. Your buffoonery always brought a smile to my face.~
@38681 = ~Then as a personal favor to you, allow me to arrange it so your face does nothing BUT smile for the rest of eternity.~
@38682 = ~Oh no, <CHARNAME>. No, no, no. Bad idea. Oh no.~ [BD38682]
@38683 = ~That is hardly a compromise at all— Ah. Wait. I understand your meaning now.~
@38684 = ~No prisoner for you, Light Lady of Shiny Evil Brightness!~ [BD38684]
@38685 = ~The Voice~
@38686 = ~Waterdhavian Soldier~
@38687 = ~Crusader Sergeant~
@38688 = ~Flaming Fist Sergeant~
@38689 = ~Ashatiel~
@38690 = ~Daggerford Militia~
@38691 = ~I can hear you singing, Garrick.~
@38692 = ~There are some who like my singing, dearest Alyth.~
@38693 = ~They can like it somewhere else. Only one singer is allowed here, as you well know.~
@38694 = ~The Elfsong takes its name from a ghost that haunts it—an unknown elven maiden who died under mysterious circumstances countless years ago. ~
@38695 = ~They say that those who listen can still hear her mournful song. And the owner is steadfast in her insistence that no one who patronizes the tavern will hear anyone else's song.~
@38696 = ~I should leave this place—go somewhere people might appreciate my talents. But let's not dwell on that. I have good news...~
@38697 = ~She still resists my charm, <CHARNAME>. But I'll wear her down eventually.~
@38698 = ~I admire your persistence.~
@38699 = ~Tell me a tale, Garrick. A tale of the Shining Lady Caelar Argent.~
@38700 = ~What sort of man desires a worn-down woman?~
@38701 = ~An artist often faces rejection. The great artist doesn't let that stop him.~
@38702 = ~She's the talk of the town, quite literally. Thousands of those now inside the Gate were driven here by Caelar's crusade in the north.~
@38703 = ~As I hear it, Caelar is the stuff of legends, the heroine of a thousand stories yet to be told. Stories are your business, Garrick. Surely you know more than this?~
@38704 = ~This is all you've heard?~
@38705 = ~This is something any <PRO_MANWOMAN> with eyes to see is already well aware of. Do you know anything useful about her?~
@38706 = ~Rumors. Whispers of echoes, nothing more. Some say she is an aasimar. Others the child of a god. Some believe she is Sarevok's own sister.~
@38707 = ~Whatever the case, it is indisputably true that she inspires great loyalty in her followers. Many of those seeking refuge were driven from their homes by their own families.~
@38708 = ~She seeks to gather a great army to her side, to what end I can only guess. Considering the progress her forces have made these past weeks, I'd not bet against her achieving her goal, whatever it may be.~
@38709 = ~And that is what I know of Caelar Argent. If you intend to challenge her... Well, you did defeat Sarevok Anchev. I suppose you know what you're doing. I'd not want to face her myself, if I could possibly avoid it. Luck to you.~
@38710 = ~Not all. There are... how best to put this...?~
@38711 = ~One who is consumed by love.~
@38712 = ~I don't think that's love.~
@38713 = ~If you say so...~
@38714 = ~You're consumed by something, there's no doubting that.~
@38715 = ~Then you do not know love. I pity you.~
@38716 = ~You question my devotion? You know nothing. You have not felt love as I feel it now, cannot possibly understand the furious complexity of the emotions that spur me to action.~
@38717 = ~I believe we're done talking. And so I shall bid you farewell.~
@38718 = ~You see, Boo? I said we would meet again soon, and here we are, meeting again not so long afterward. Yes, my friend, what is it Minsc can do for you?~ [BD38718]
@38719 = ~I would speak with you and Dynaheir about an adventure I intend to embark upon shortly.~
@38720 = ~I leave the city with a contingent of Flaming Fist mercenaries heading north to face Caelar the Shining Lady on the morrow. Would you care to join me?~
@38721 = ~There is little you can do for me. Or anyone else, I suspect.~
@38722 = ~It has been too long since Minsc had evil butts to kick. And Boo, well—Boo says there are too many feet in this city now. We would like to come with you.~ [BD38722]
@38723 = ~Boo says you should walk with care, friend. You would do well to heed the wisdom of the giant miniature space hamster.~ [BD38723]
@38724 = ~Yes? Is there something else thou dost need?~ [BD38724]
@38725 = ~No, no. Is there anything I can do for you?~
@38726 = ~I've changed my mind. I don't think I'll need your assistance on the journey ahead of me after all.~
@38727 = ~No, there isn't. I was just considering my next move.~
@38728 = ~Hmm. Hast thou any knowledge of thy foe? I would know more of this Caelar Argent.~ [BD38728]
@38729 = ~As would I. Unfortunately, all I really know of her is that she's driven thousands from their homes and she tried to kill me and Imoen.~
@38730 = ~You know as much as I do. Probably more.~
@38731 = ~She tried to kill me and Imoen, and she will pay for that mistake. That is all you need to know.~
@38732 = ~Perhaps in time she may reveal more of herself. Good luck on thine quest. Should you require mine assistance after all, you need but speak to me.~ [BD38732]
@38733 = ~I hope you're right.~
@38734 = ~So it would seem.~
@38735 = ~Speaking for myself, I know more than enough already.~
@38736 = ~Thy certainty is one of thy greatest strengths, but some of us are less sanguine about the idea of killing those we do not know.~ [BD38736]
@38737 = ~But this is not the time to discuss such things. Minsc and I have much to do to prepare for the journey. Go, we'll see thee at the High Hall soon.~
@38738 = ~If that is thy wish, then we shall not travel too close at thy side. But thou hast made me curious about this Caelar now. I would know more of her. Perhaps thou shalt see us again sooner that thou thinks. Fare thee well, <CHARNAME>. Until we meet again.~
@38739 = ~Fare thee well, <CHARNAME>. Until we meet again.~
@38740 = ~There is wisdom in that. When thou hast reached a decision, let me know of it.~ [BD38740]
@38741 = ~Minsc and I have much to do and precious little time to do it. Leave us to our preparations. We'll see thee soon at the High Hall.~
@38742 = ~Quiet, please, <CHARNAME>. Boo is deep in contemplation.~ [BD38742]
@38743 = ~Now tell me what I speak of:

A useful tool, though most despise it.
In light, it can topple kingdoms; in shadows, it sustains nations.
Paupers fear it daily; kings fear it deeply. 
You were born to serve it, but because of it, you will die.

What is it?~ [BD38743]
@38744 = ~Any sign of Caelar? We have to find the witch...~
@38745 = ~All right. I'm sure this could be worse. Exactly how it could be worse, I don't know, but there must be a way. Right?~
@38746 = ~Oh, hells. This is a fine, fiery fix.~
@38747 = ~Least it's not cold.~ [BD38747]
@38748 = ~Get me out of here, <CHARNAME>. Quickly, please.~ [BD38748]
@38749 = ~It's been too long since I traversed the infernal planes... Good times. Good times.~
@38750 = ~What have you brought me to, <CHARNAME>? This is not the Hell for Dorn Il-Khan.~ [BD38750]
@38751 = ~Let's do what we c-c-came to do and begone from here.~ [BD38751]
@38752 = ~ 'Tis everything the Harpers feared and more...~
@38753 = ~Thou dost always take me to such interesting places, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD38753]
@38754 = ~Selûne... May your light shine upon me even in this dismal place...~ [BD38754]
@38755 = ~The whole place is burning...~
@38756 = ~I didn't do it.~
@38757 = ~Out of the frying pan into... THIS. Well DONE, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD38757]
@38758 = ~By the Oak Father's leafy arse! Old Voghiln's been in some hot spots before, but this is a kettle of a different kind.~ [BD38758]
@38759 = ~Hell is no place for heroes! With me, Boo! We will fight till this place is naught but ashes!~ [BD38759]
@38760 = ~You should never have come to this place, mortals. But we're so very glad you did!~
@38761 = ~Back, you devils! Back, I say!~ [BD38761]
@38762 = ~We're the ones who should be going back, Darnas!~
@38763 = ~Back to what, Val? Dragonspear belongs to our foes.~
@38764 = ~And Avernus belongs to devils! Damn Caelar! The Shining Lady led us to our ruin!~
@38765 = ~There is no going back for you, mortals, nor forward either. Your journey ends here!~
@38766 = ~Take heart, crusaders! Together we will slay this fiend.~
@38767 = ~This doesn't look like a battle I want to be a part of. I'm going to stay out of this.~
@38768 = ~I could watch crusaders meet their horrible ends for hours...~
@38769 = ~You're in my way, foul fiend. Now meet your death.~
@38770 = ~Now die on my talons, foolish crusaders!~
@38771 = ~How wonderful—another mortal comes to entertain the poxbringer Illaruel! Join the fun!~
@38772 = ~Join the fun!~
@38773 = ~You would let these dirty devils do as they will? Boo says this is no good. And Minsc is VERY good!~ [BD38773]
@38774 = ~Yes! Tear them wing from limb!~ [BD38774]
@38775 = ~More mortals come to entertain the poxbringer Illaruel? How wonderful. Minions! Rip them to shreds and bring me their hearts!~
@38776 = ~You know, I don't think I've ever slain a fiend before. This should be fun.~ [BD38776]
@38777 = ~You have my thanks. Without your help, we would surely be dead by now.~ [BD38777]
@38778 = ~Did you expect some other result when you charged headlong into one of the Nine Hells?~
@38779 = ~Do not think you are saved yet, crusader. You live only because you might be of use to me.~
@38780 = ~There is a bridge not far from here that leads to a gray stone tower. When last I saw Caelar, she was making her way toward it in pursuit of Hephernaan.~ [BD38780]
@38781 = ~Go back to the portal. Return to Dragonspear, and pray I can end this ere devils tear you apart.~
@38782 = ~You mean that dark, sinister tower yonder? I don't suppose there's a less ominous and foreboding tower in the area, by any chance? No, of course not, that would be too easy. All right then, off I go.~
@38783 = ~Then that is where I must go.~
@38784 = ~Thank you! Thank you and may the gods bless you.~
@38785 = ~Minsc, get this man back through the portal.~
@38786 = ~Voghiln, would you be so kind as to escort our friends here back to Toril?~
@38787 = ~Khalid. Watch over these people as you did those in Bridgefort.~
@38788 = ~Rasaad. You cared for the weak and needy in Baldur's Gate. I need you to do the same here now.~
@38789 = ~Corwin, I know you won't to like this, but you're these peoples' best chance of getting out of here alive.~
@38790 = ~Edwin, only a Red Wizard can see these people back to Toril alive. Will you do it?~
@38791 = ~Neera, get these people back to Prime Material Plane, please.~
@38792 = ~Jaheira, escort these people back to the Dragonspear portal.~
@38793 = ~Safana, you don't really want to be here. Get these people back to Dragonspear.~
@38794 = ~Dynaheir. Get thyself back to Dragonspear and take these people with you.~
@38795 = ~Glint, I know you'd rather take the tour of Avernus, but these people need your help.~
@38796 = ~Baeloth, take care of this man. Get him back to Toril.~
@38797 = ~Viconia, guide these people as Shar has guided you. Get them back to Dragonspear. If I survive the coming trials, I'll see you there.~
@38798 = ~Dorn, see this man back to Toril. Alive, if it's possible.~
@38799 = ~M'Khiin, show these people not all goblins are monsters. Do what you can to get them back to Dragonspear alive.~
@38800 = ~Actually, now that I've considered the matter, I've changed my mind. I'll need all the help I can get to face your mistress. You're on your own.~
@38801 = ~Wait! Before I was fool enough to commit myself to Caelar's idiocy, I was a man of means.~
@38802 = ~And what of us?~
@38803 = ~There's nothing but death for you here. Return to Dragonspear. I shall deal with Caelar.~
@38804 = ~Do as you will, for as long as you're able. I doubt you'll last long.~
@38805 = ~You? You shall die, as your damnable mistress and all who dare stand against me shall die. You expected nothing more, surely?~
@38806 = ~So that's the way of it, then? Fine. But know this: Though I die on this godsforsaken plane, you have not seen the last of me. I will avenge myself and my followers, I swear it.~
@38807 = ~I hope, in time, you'll see that I do what I must. The betterment of many sometimes comes at the expense of the few. I wish it were not so.~
@38808 = ~Good luck with that.~
@38809 = ~Avenge yourself on the Shining Lady, fool. It was she who brought you to this ignoble end.~
@38810 = ~I shall do as you say. May the Lady—I mean... Tymora favor you. Farewell.~ [BD38810]
@38811 = ~Do not leave us here alone to die. Will none of you see us back through the portal?~
@38812 = ~Would that my anger, like Caelars', could silence my conscience—then I could leave you to your fiery fate. But I cannot. One of my friends will take you back.~
@38813 = ~Give me the damned ring. One of my friends will see you home.~
@38814 = ~You'll not die alone. Your men are with you.~
@38815 = ~Yes, all I own will be yours, I swear it. What do you say? Don't leave us here to die, I beg you.~
@38816 = ~Minsc, get this man back through the portal.~
@38817 = ~Voghiln, would you be so kind as to escort our friends here back to Toril?~

@38831 = ~No, I don't think so.~
@38832 = ~It is your lucky day, crusader man! You're in good hands with Minsc.~
@38833 = ~My lucky day, you say? It sure doesn't feel like it.~
@38834 = ~Take care of thyself, my friend. I'll see thee soon on the other side of the portal.~
@38835 = ~The Lion of Luskan will see to it no harm comes to these invaders. May the Oak Father watch over you, <CHARNAME>. I will see you on the other side of the portal.~
@38836 = ~Is there no one else who can do this? After what happened at Bridgefort, I d-don't want to be anywhere but at my wife's side.~
@38837 = ~F-follow me, servants of Caelar. I'll see y-y-you back to Toril. I'll t-try to, anyway.~
@38838 = ~~
@38839 = ~V-very well. Follow me, crusaders. I'll s-see you back to Dragonspear. Or try to, at least.~
@38840 = ~These men and women followed a false light to this dark place. I will guide them back to Toril and truth, or die in the attempt.~
@38841 = ~You're right. I don't like it. But I haven't liked a lot of what I've had to do these past weeks. All right, crusaders! Pick yourselves up, we're heading back to Dragonspear. Let's go, let's go!~
@38842 = ~I suppose I can keep these poor unfortunates safe in the Dragonspear vault while you confront Caelar, Hephernaan, and all the devils of Avernus. (And if I discover a way to close the portal on my own? The needs of the many outweigh those of the few, and Odesseiron's needs outweigh all.)~
@38843 = ~Nowhere to go but up, right?~
@38844 = ~As you wish.~
@38845 = ~I don't want to be here, but a vault with an open portal to Hell's hardly an improvement. Fix this, <CHARNAME>. Fix it quickly. Come on then, crusaders, it's back to Toril for us.~
@38846 = ~What? Minsc cannot leave his witch alone in this place!~
@38847 = ~Calm thyself, my friend. We shall not be apart long. Go, find Caelar, make her tell you how to close the portal.~
@38848 = ~I shall do what I can to get these people back home.~
@38849 = ~Fine, I'll get them back. But you better not have any fun without me.~
@38850 = ~Draft the drow to defend the dullards, eh? Very well. Don't dawdle, dimwits! To Dragonspear!~
@38851 = ~Follow me, oolos, and you may yet survive your service to the Shining Lady.~
@38852 = ~I'll see what I can do. Crusaders! Come with me if you want to live.~
@38853 = ~You shining fools followed the orange woman and see where you are now? Come with me if you want to live.~
@38854 = ~Kill us now, then. Better to die at your hands than those beast's claws.~
@38855 = ~Take heart. You live when countless of your brothers and sisters do not. Where there's life, there's hope.~
@38856 = ~I'd indulge you, but I haven't time to kill you while Caelar's still on the loose.~
@38857 = ~What kind of talk is that? At least TRY to act like a man of honor, not some sniveling coward.~
@38858 = ~~
@38859 = ~I tell you I'll not let myself die in a devil's grasp! Kill me now or by all that's holy I will kill you!~

@38866 = ~After her! She's our only hope to seal the portal.~
@38867 = ~Your part in this is done, <CHARNAME>. Now let me do mine!~ [BD38867]
@38868 = ~This has to end, Caelar. Come back to Dragonspear. We will seal the portal together.~
@38869 = ~You can't free the dead of the Dragonspear Wars, Caelar. It can't be done!~
@38870 = ~My part is done? I've barely started, "Shining Lady." You'll not leave this place alive.~
@38871 = ~I cannot stop. There's no turning back for me, not now. I swore an oath once long ago. I must keep it.~ [BD38871]
@38872 = ~You may be right—I no longer know. But there's no turning back for me now. I swore an oath many years ago. I will keep it.~ [BD38872]
@38873 = ~I don't expect to. But there is one here who WILL leave this place—no matter the cost!~ [BD38873]
@38874 = ~Uh, what?~
@38875 = ~You fight well, <CHARNAME>. Thrix the Profane is impressed.~ [BD38875]
@38876 = ~Thrix's master bid him bar all but the Argent, for a time. And Thrix would not want to disappoint his master. UNLESS...~ [BD38876]
@38877 = ~If Thrix believed his master would not be his master much longer—if he believed YOU might slay his master—then Thrix might allow you passage. Master has been most vexing since the business with Crenshinibon. Thrix is weary.~ [BD38877]
@38878 = ~I haven't time for your nonsense, devil. Will you let me pass, or no?~
@38879 = ~If Thrix REALLY wanted his master to fall, Thrix might offer more assistance than merely standing aside.~
@38880 = ~Open the doors, devil! Caelar must die at my hand.~
@38881 = ~You have a new master now, devil, and <PRO_HISHER> name is <CHARNAME>.~
@38882 = ~Die at OUR hands.~
@38883 = ~Thrix fights when and where he wills. You have chosen violence, and violence will come to you. Watch your shadow, child of murder. Some day you may find Thrix lurking within it.~
@38884 = ~If Thrix's master discovers his betrayal, Thrix will find you before his master finds him. You will suffer more at Thrix's claws than he ever will at his dark lord's. Do not disappoint Thrix.~
@38885 = ~Thrix fights when and where he will. You have chosen violence and violence will come to you, in time. Watch your shadow, child of murder, for one day soon you will find Thrix lurking within it.~
@38886 = ~You are in the first and greatest of the Hells, little thing. Nothing here comes free. But perhaps you might be interested in a wager?~ [BD38886]
@38887 = ~Thrix has three items that might be of use to one who would storm the basalt tower. This blade, sharper than the loudest shriek. This helm that cradles the head more softly than a mother does her newborn babe.~
@38888 = ~This staff is gnarled and ugly—all but useless. But if you win my bet, it or one of the others would be yours.~
@38889 = ~If I take this bet and win, I get one of your items. And if I lose?~
@38890 = ~I'll take your wager.~
@38891 = ~Thrix is glad to hear it, though you should have let Thrix finish telling you the terms before agreeing. For if you lose the bet, you will also lose one of your friends to Thrix's service.~
@38892 = ~What? No, no, I can't accept that. The bet is off.~
@38893 = ~I said yes, and I meant it. Who do you want?~
@38894 = ~Foul wretch! You think to trick me into sacrificing an ally? I withdraw my agreement!~
@38895 = ~Aha. Thrix does not know how this sort of thing works in the Prime Material Plane. But in Avernus, a contract is a contract. The wager is made. Win and one of these items will be yours. Lose and Thrix takes one of your friends.~ [BD38895]
@38896 = ~Then Thrix takes your soul.~
@38897 = ~Very well. I agree to your terms.~
@38898 = ~You want my soul, fiend? Then fight for it—there's no other way you'll get your claws into anything of mine.~
@38899 = ~Thrix thought you might. But who, who shall the profane one take when—I mean if—you lose our wager?~ [BD38899]
@38900 = ~The monk will do. There is a delicious darkness within him. Fail to answer the riddle and he will become Thrix's.~
@38901 = ~So be it. Ask me your riddle. If I cannot answer it true, Rasaad is yours.~
@38902 = ~Rasaad is too good a man to risk losing to such as you, Thrix.~
@38903 = ~It's a poor <PRO_MANWOMAN> indeed who'd risk a steadfast friend like Rasaad in so cavalier a fashion. No, this will be our wager: If I fail to answer your riddle, mine is the soul you will take. Agreed?~
@38904 = ~Stand aside and let me into the tower, Thrix, lest you face the darkness within me.~
@38905 = ~The woman there, the one with the empty smile. If you cannot answer Thrix's riddle, he will take her.~
@38906 = ~Ask the riddle. If I can't answer it, you can take her. Sorry, Safana. I need to get through that door.~
@38907 = ~There's more to Safana than a smile, Thrix. I'll not lose her, not to you.~
@38908 = ~No. I'll not risk Safana's life on a devil's wager. If I can't answer your riddle, mine is the soul you take. Agreed?~
@38909 = ~No more games, Thrix. I'm in no mood to play. Let me into the tower or pay the price.~
@38910 = ~Red Wizards make for a tasty meal. If Thrix wins, if you cannot answer his riddle, he will eat Red Wizard this very night.~
@38911 = ~You want Edwin? All right. Ask me your riddle. If I can't answer it, you can take him.~
@38912 = ~Prepare to go hungry, Thrix—the Thayan is of use to me, and for as long as that's so, you'll not have him. Pick another of my party as a prize or stand aside and let me pass.~
@38913 = ~He has his faults, but I'll not risk Edwin Odesseiron's soul in so blithe a fashion. If I cannot answer your riddle, mine is the soul you will take. Agreed?~
@38914 = ~I'll feed you your own limbs if you don't let me into the tower, you wretched creature. I'm done playing games with you.~
@38915 = ~Your drow magician seems an entertaining distraction. If you cannot answer Thrix's riddle, you will lose the wager, and lose him.~
@38916 = ~Very well. Though if I lose this bet, I hope you enjoy alliteration.~
@38917 = ~I'm loathe to lose a lackey like Baeloth. What can I say? The lighthearted loon makes me laugh.~
@38918 = ~It's a poor <PRO_MANWOMAN> indeed who'd sacrifice a friend in such a way. If I can't answer your riddle, it's not Baeloth's soul you will take—it is mine. Agreed?~
@38919 = ~Let me into the tower now, Thrix, or the last thing the distraction I provide will be is entertaining.~
@38920 = ~There is something about the goblin that walks by your side... Thrix is fascinated by her potential. If Thrix wins, if you cannot answer his riddle, he will take her.~
@38921 = ~Ask your riddle then. If I cannot answer, M'Khiin is yours.~
@38922 = ~M'Khiin has endured more than enough pain in her life. I won't add to it. Choose another prize, fiend.~
@38923 = ~M'Khiin's been too often treated as another's property—she deserves better and she'll get it, from me at least. Here's the bargain, devil: If I fail to answer your riddle, mine is the soul you will take. Agreed?~
@38924 = ~I'll not play this game with you, devil. Stand aside, or pay the price.~
@38925 = ~Thrix mislikes the gleam in that gnome's eye. If you do not answer Thrix's riddle correctly, Thrix will take him. We'll see how long he smiles then.~
@38926 = ~I've only known Glint Gardnersonson a short time, yet I think even you would have trouble suppressing his smile, profane one. Ask me the riddle; if I cannot answer, you'll get to find out.~
@38927 = ~No, we won't. I'll not leave Glint in your claws, Thrix. If you truly want to do this, choose another for your prize.~
@38928 = ~It'd take more than you to dim Glint's passion, Thrix—not that you'll ever find out, for mine is the soul we will wager upon. Agreed?~
@38929 = ~Stand aside and let us into that tower, now, or I promise you you'll never smile again.~
@38930 = ~Thrix knows a servant of Ur-Gothoz when he smells one. The half-orc will serve as Thrix's prize should you fail to answer the riddle.~
@38931 = ~Agreed.~
@38932 = ~Hah! I'm halfway tempted to take you up on the offer, as I know you'd not survive long with Dorn Il-Khan as your prisoner. But no, he is too valuable to me. Choose another for your prize.~
@38933 = ~I suspect Dorn Il-Khan's patron would take issue with one or both of us were I to agree to this wager and lose. There's just one soul I can speak for here, and it is my own. If I can't answer your riddle, I am yours. Agreed?~
@38934 = ~I'll not play your twisted game, devil. Stand aside, or pay the price.~
@38935 = ~The wild mage is a fiery one, isn't she? Thrix could have fun with her. If you lose the bet, if you can't answer the riddle, you lose her to Thrix, yes?~
@38936 = ~I accept your terms, but you should know: If anyone can find a way to burn Hell down, it is Neera.~
@38937 = ~As fiery as she is fair. You think I'd risk losing her to you? Think again. Choose someone else as your trophy—you'll never have Neera.~
@38938 = ~I'll not risk a friend's soul on a devil's wager—only my own. If I fail to answer your riddle, take me as your prize. What say you?~
@38939 = ~I'll not play your twisted game, devil. Stand aside, or pay the price.~
@38940 = ~It's a rare drow indeed that finds herself here. Most belong to the Spider Queen... but not this one. If you cannot answer Thrix's riddle, she will belong to him.~
@38941 = ~Better you have her than the Spider Goddess. I accept your terms. If I cannot answer your riddle, Viconia is yours.~
@38942 = ~Viconia will never belong to you, Thrix. If you want to wager, pick someone else to be your prize.~
@38943 = ~Viconia belong to Shar and Shar's she shall remain. If I fail to answer your riddle, mine is the soul you will take. What say you?~
@38944 = ~I'll not play your twisted game, devil. Stand aside, or pay the price.~
@38945 = ~A Luskan skald makes even the direst of pits less dreary. If you can't answer Thrix's riddle, I will take yours to keep me company.~
@38946 = ~And fine company he'd be, if I fail to answer your riddle—which I won't. I accept your terms, devil. If you win the wager, Voghiln will remain with you.~
@38947 = ~I'm not in the habit of denying myself pleasure, and Voghiln's company is a pleasure indeed. You cannot have him; choose another prize for this wager of yours.~
@38948 = ~It's a poor <PRO_MANWOMAN> indeed who'd sacrifice a friend in such a way. If I can't answer your riddle, you will take me, and let them go on their way. Agreed?~
@38949 = ~I'll not play your twisted game, devil. Stand aside, or pay the price.~
@38950 = ~You willingly gamble your own soul? Oh, Thrix LIKES you. And he agrees—you'll make a fine addition to his collection. And now, the riddle.~ [BD38950]
@38951 = ~"Lackey"? Methinks my meretricious myrmidon misunderstands my most favored maxim on this matter: "You're not the boss of me."~ [BD38951]
@38952 = ~You should like this, child of Bhaal. Thrix's riddle was devised for you and you alone.~ [BD38952]
@38953 = ~It can only be my father.~
@38954 = ~It is I, the Bhaalspawn.~
@38955 = ~You speak of murder, devil.~
@38956 = ~Sabotage!~
@38957 = ~It is irrelevant, as is this ludicrous wager. You should have stood aside when you had the chance, Thrix.~
@38958 = ~Something so petty? No. Thrix will now take what is his.~
@38959 = ~The dead Lord of Murder? No. That is not the answer.~ [BD38959]
@38960 = ~You believe yourself a tool, child of Bhaal? It will take more than a mere tool to defeat Thrix the Profane's master.~
@38961 = ~Your soul is Thrix's now, Selûnite. There will come a night, Selûnite, darker than any you have ever known. On that night, you will gaze up into the sky and see not your mistress but Thrix's glorious visage.~
@38962 = ~I am sorry, Rasaad.~
@38963 = ~The hells he will. A dead devil takes no souls.~
@38964 = ~Your soul is forfeit, woman. Live on, knowing you are forever marked by Thrix.~
@38965 = ~I have failed you, Safana. But a bargain's a bargain.~
@38966 = ~The hells she is. A dead fiend takes no souls.~
@38967 = ~The Red Wizard's soul will make a fine feast for Thrix... someday. Savor each moment left to you, Thayan. You will not know which is your last.~
@38968 = ~Sorry to lose you, Edwin.~
@38969 = ~The hells it will. A dead fiend eats no souls.~
@38970 = ~The drow's soul is marked now. When the time is right, the master of one pit shall become Thrix's slave in this one.~
@38971 = ~Sorry, Baeloth, but you more than anyone know the importance of fulfilling your commitments.~
@38972 = ~A dead devil is a master of nothing. Your end is nigh, fiend!~
@38973 = ~Your soul is marked, little goblin. Someday Thrix will collect that which is his.~
@38974 = ~I have failed you, M'Khiin. Forgive me.~
@38975 = ~You'll collect nothing, Thrix. You'll be dead.~
@38976 = ~There is much light within you, gnome, but that light is stained forevermore. Thrix has marked your soul. Someday, Thrix will collect that which is his.~
@38977 = ~This isn't right, Glint. I know that. But a bargain's a bargain.~
@38978 = ~You'll collect nothing, Thrix. You'll be dead.~
@38979 = ~Thrix has marked your soul, half-orc. Kneel before thy new master!~
@38980 = ~Go ahead, Dorn. Kneel before Thrix.~
@38981 = ~Dorn Il-Khan kneels before one devil and one alone, Thrix. You aren't him. Your end is nigh.~
@38982 = ~Your soul is marked, elf.~
@38983 = ~Half-elf.~ [BD59477]
@38984 = ~You are Thrix's now. The day I come to collect what is mine, no magic will save you.~
@38985 = ~A bet's a bet, Neera. I'm sorry.~
@38986 = ~You'll collect nothing, Thrix. You'll be dead.~
@38987 = ~Your soul is marked, daughter of Shar. A time will come, a night darker than any you have known, and on that night Thrix will collect what is his. Then you shall serve the Profane One.~
@38988 = ~This isn't what I wanted, Viconia. But a wager was made, and I lost. Forgive me.~
@38989 = ~She'll not serve any devil, Thrix—certainly not one as dead as you will soon be.~
@38990 = ~Your soul bears Thrix's mark, skald! Your tale will end at the Profane One's discretion.~
@38991 = ~Forgive me, Voghiln. I'm sorry this had to happen.~
@38992 = ~The hells it will. Your tale ends now, fiend.~
@38993 = ~Such fear, such dread—Thrix would savor it a time. Go, little mortal, but do not forget that your soul is marked. You belong to the Profane One. Soon, very soon, he will take what is his.~
@38994 = ~That moment is not now, though. Keep your bargain, fiend. Open the way and begone from my sight.~
@38995 = ~Not soon enough, devil, for I will take your life now!~
@38996 = ~Thrix's master should be finished with the Shining Lady by now. Enter freely, and of your own will.~ [BD39028]
@38997 = ~I'm not sorry at all.~ [BD38997]
@38998 = ~Beware, my friend. One who bargains with devils may become a devil if they are not careful.~ [BD38998]
@38999 = ~Avernus is a suitable home for a she-devil such as yourself.~ [BD38999]
@39000 = ~You just made the biggest mistake of your life, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD39000]
@39001 = ~Speak for thyself.~ [BD39001]
@39002 = ~What are you talking about, you wretched chimp? You seriously expect me to accept this, this, this—THIS? (Where are the words when you need them, Odesseiron?)~ [BD39002]
@39003 = ~No! Odesseiron will not be tossed aside like so many banana peels!~ [BD39003]
@39004 = ~A contract is conclusive. Custom compels my cooperation.~ [BD39004]
@39005 = ~No! I'll not be taken again—I'll die first!~ [BD39005]
@39006 = ~A bargain with a devil is no bargain at all!~
@39007 = ~It's all right. I've enjoyed our adventures together. I look forward to this new one. Just—if you should ever happen to cross paths with my mother—her name's Helena, Helena Gardnersonson—tell her I love her, yes? It might not have always seemed so. I'd like her to know.~ [BD39007]
@39008 = ~I don't think he's going to kneel before Thrix.~ [BD39008]
@39009 = ~There is but one master Dorn Il-Khan will kneel before. Ur-Gothoz! Guide my hand in destroying this devil who dares command your servant!~ [BD39009]
@39010 = ~And you, <CHARNAME>. Your betrayal will not go unpunished!~ [BD39010]
@39011 = ~Say it is not so, <CHARNAME>! You cannot give the funny fire elf to this fiend!~ [BD39011]
@39012 = ~That is cold. I mean really cold. There's snow, and there's ice, and then there's... you.~ [BD39012]
@39013 = ~Nay, this cannot be! You cannot give this beautiful, ebon-skinned lass to that pit-fiend!~ [BD39013]
@39014 = ~Shar take your soul, you vile traitor!~ [BD39014]
@39015 = ~This is an evil thing, my friend. Do not let the devil take him.~ [BD39015]
@39016 = ~My father always said I'd meet a bad end. And my mother said my soul would be gambled away to a fiend of the fiery pits. I must admit, I didn't give her much heed at the time.~ [BD39016]
@39017 = ~You have answered my riddle. Aren't you clever? Clever, clever Bhaalspawn. Now choose your prize.~ [BD39017]
@39018 = ~I would have that sword.~
@39019 = ~Give me the helm.~
@39020 = ~I want the staff.~
@39021 = ~You want this gnarled piece of wood? No, Thrix thinks not. The sword is what you want, the sword or the helm.~
@39022 = ~We had a deal, Thrix. Give me the staff.~
@39023 = ~You're right. Give me the sword.~
@39024 = ~Perhaps you're right. I'll take the helm, then.~
@39025 = ~Take it, then.~
@39026 = ~An excellent choice. You won't regret it.~
@39027 = ~You are most wise. It will serve you well in the struggles ahead.~
@39028 = ~Thrix's master should be finished with the Shining Lady by now. Enter freely, and of your own will.~ [BD39028]
@39029 = ~OUT! Get out, you vile, poxy snake!~ [BD39029]
@39030 = ~In the future, I would appreciate a warning that I might be offered up as a potential sacrifice to infernal entities prior to the offer being made, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD39030]
@39031 = ~I acted in haste, and in doing so, I risked your life. I am sorry. Forgive me, Rasaad.~
@39032 = ~Have a little faith, Rasaad. I was never going to let that devil take you. I just needed to play its game. ~
@39033 = ~If you were not so quick to whine, I'd not have been so quick to agree to Thrix's wager.~
@39034 = ~Of course I forgive you. You have done much for me. There is little I would not do for you—but please, let me know what I might be called upon to do in advance next time.~ [BD39034]
@39035 = ~I do trust you, my friend. And you know there is little I would not do for you. I just ask that, in the future, you let me know what I might be called upon to do before being volunteered to do it.~ [BD39035]
@39036 = ~So you offering me up as a prize to a fiend of this pit was my fault? An interesting perspective... and one I find more than a little unsettling.~ [BD39036]
@39037 = ~What were you playing at there, <CHARNAME>? You would risk my life, my soul, to advance your cause?~ [BD39037]
@39038 = ~In the heat of the moment, I did wrong by you. I see that now and I deeply regret it. Forgive me, Safana.~
@39039 = ~I would PRETEND to risk your life and soul, but I was never going to let Thrix take you. ~
@39040 = ~Understand this and make peace with it, Safana: Everyone is expendable. There is no one I'll not sacrifice to achieve my goals. ~
@39041 = ~I will forgive you. But don't think I'll soon forget this little episode.~ [BD39041]
@39042 = ~You are more skilled at deceit than I gave you credit for, then. Forgive me for doubting you.~ [BD39042]
@39043 = ~I see. Well. If that's what I can expect from you, in future, expect no different from me.~ [BD39043]
@39044 = ~A lesser man might resent you for serving him up to a devil, <CHARNAME>. But I know you would never have allowed that horned baboon to consume the savory Thayan flesh of the Odesseirons.~ [BD39044]
@39045 = ~I am glad you're not a lesser man. ~
@39046 = ~You're right, of course, Edwin. Now never speak of your savory Thayan flesh again, please. ~
@39047 = ~If it suits you to believe that, go ahead. I care not.~
@39048 = ~And so you should be.~ [BD39048]
@39049 = ~As you wish. (You don't know what you're missing.)~ [BD39049]
@39050 = ~Of course, of course. You must maintain the facade of indifference for these other monkeys' sake. Yours is a devious mind. I like it.~ [BD39050]
@39051 = ~It is wise of you to retain this facade of indifference. We cannot know who may watch us from afar, but it's best they do not suspect my true value to you.~ [BD39051]
@39052 = ~What the hells, <CHARNAME>? You forsake a fruitful friendship, putting your faith in fickle fortune to spare me from that foul fiend?~ [BD39052]
@39053 = ~Forgive me, Baeloth. I acted in haste, without thought. ~
@39054 = ~Relax, Baeloth. Everything turned out for the best, didn't it? ~
@39055 = ~Fortune had nothing to do with it. I had faith in myself—you would be wise to do the same. You are still with me, are you not? ~
@39056 = ~Mark me on this: Haste makes mistakes. Mistakes make misery. Next time, think a moment before making your move.~ [BD39056]
@39057 = ~I'll concede the contention, but I must confess I find myself considerably less comfortable cooperating with so contemptuous a character as you.~ [BD39057]
@39058 = ~I am, though I'm considerably less comfortable cooperating with so contemptible a character as yourself.~ [BD39058]
@39059 = ~Now I know what you think of me, <CHARNAME>. I was happier not knowing.~ [BD39059]
@39060 = ~I am truly sorry, M'Khiin. In the heat of the moment, I did wrong by you. I will never forgive myself for it.~
@39061 = ~You have to know I was never going to let that vile devil take you. ~
@39062 = ~Understand this and make peace with it, goblin: Everyone is expendable. There is no one I'll not sacrifice to achieve my goals. ~
@39063 = ~Neither will I.~ [BD39063]
@39064 = ~I don't know that. I don't know it at all. I just know what you said.~ [BD39064]
@39065 = ~You're the same as the rest. I was stupid to think different.~ [BD39065]
@39066 = ~I know you were never going to let that devil take me, <CHARNAME>. You weren't, were you? Of course not. Right? Right, right. I am right, aren't I?~ [BD39066]
@39067 = ~If you felt any concern over my wager with Thrix, I am deeply sorry, Glint.~
@39068 = ~I was never going to let the devil take you, Glint. Never doubt that.~
@39069 = ~If you know it already, there's no reason for me to say it.~
@39070 = ~Well, that's some apology. I can't help but notice you didn't actually say you weren't prepared to sacrifice me, though. Were we somewhere else, I might be disturbed by the omission, but this place has made me as uneasy as I can possibly be already.~ [BD39070]
@39071 = ~I'll admit to some momentary concern, but I'll take you at your word. Thank you for the reassurance.~ [BD39071]
@39072 = ~Yeah... Were we somewhere else, I might be disturbed by that, but this infernal pit has made me as disturbed as I possibly can be already.~ [BD39072]
@39073 = ~You tossed me to that devil like a piece of meat before a rabid dog. Explain yourself.~ [BD39073]
@39074 = ~I made a mistake, I see that now. I know you'll not accept an apology, so I'll not insult you by offering one. Just know that I'll take more care in the future.~
@39075 = ~Do you really think I was going to let that devil take you, Dorn? Really?~

@39079 = ~You played Thrix's game to quicken your progress, and having lost the bet, you knew you couldn't afford to lose me. Yes, I see it now. I would have done the same. Very well, then. The Shining Witch still lives. Let us find her and rectify that situation.~ [BD39079]
@39080 = ~You played Thrix's game hoping to hasten our progress, and you were successful in that. But you knew you couldn't afford to lose me; you never intended to honor the agreement if it did not serve your purpose. Yes, I see it now. I would have done the same. Very well, then. Caelar still lives—a situation I would see rectified sooner than later.~ [BD39080]

@39084 = ~Do you really think I was going to let Thrix take you, Viconia? Really?~
@39085 = ~Understand this and make peace with it, Viconia DeVir: Everyone is expendable. There is no one I'll not sacrifice to achieve my goals.~
@39086 = ~That makes two of us.~ [BD39086]
@39087 = ~You tell me you weren't? Very well. I will accept this explanation—for now. But I'll not soon forget what happened here.~ [BD39087]
@39088 = ~I will remember this. And you should know: I feel exactly the same about you.~ [BD39088]
@39089 = ~You played with fire there, <CHARNAME>. But I notice it was mighty Voghiln who took the heat.~ [BD39089]

@39093 = ~Wellll... It all seems to have worked out for the best, ja? Voghiln cannot argue with results. Let us go to the Basalt Tower now, and bring an end to the Shining Lady's tale.~ [BD39093]
@39094 = ~Ho ho! And Voghiln thought Luskans were cold. You have ice water in your veins, mine friend. Perhaps this place will warm you up—but I am doubting it.~ [BD39094]
@39095 = ~Everyone stay alert. We don't know what we're heading into.~ [BD39095]

@39113 = ~What is this? The spawn of Bhaal...? Damn! I'll have Thrix's hide for this!~ [BD39113]
@39114 = ~What's going on here, Caelar? Who is this Aun? What does he have to do with your crusade?~
@39115 = ~He really is a treacherous weasel. Then again, he is a devil and his name is Thrix the Profane. What did you expect, really?~
@39116 = ~The Profane One is the last thing you should be concerned about, fiend.~
@39117 = ~Ah, the child of Bhaal. Welcome, welcome! You're just in time to witness the fall of Caelar Argent.~ [BD39117]
@39118 = ~What's going on here, Caelar? ~

@39120 = ~We shall see.~
@39121 = ~There is nothing you or anyone can do to save her now, godling. She will hang in the hall of my lord Belhifet, and you will hang beside her.~ [BD39121]
@39122 = ~Damn you, Hephernaan! It was your treachery that brought me to this!~ [BD39122]
@39123 = ~This is the secret of Caelar's crusade, <CHARNAME>. There is only one soul in Avernus Caelar has ever cared for. Her uncle, Aun Argent—the man who sacrificed all to save her.~ [BD39123]
@39124 = ~Is this true, Caelar?~
@39125 = ~I thought Caelar threw the Sword Coast into chaos. Now, the true villain stands revealed, and he will answer for his perfidy.~
@39126 = ~And what was my role in this? Why did you try to have me killed?~
@39127 = ~Wait, wait. Slow down. Aun sacrificed himself for Caelar?~
@39128 = ~The crusade, the carnage it wrought, the death and destruction it left in its wake—it was all for one man?~
@39129 = ~So long I was trapped here, unable to reach the Material Plane. And then this child walked willingly, blindly into my domain. No mere mortal either, but an aasimar, and an Argent, and mine, all mine.~ [BD39129]
@39130 = ~I know not what lies brought Caelar here, Belhifet, and I care not. The fiend behind the crusade stands revealed, and you will pay for the Sword Coast's suffering!~
@39131 = ~If she was yours, how does she fight against you now?~
@39132 = ~Caelar is mine, monster. She must pay for her crimes against me.~
@39133 = ~Take her, then. Snuff the Shining Lady's light out for all time. I'll shed no tears for her.~
@39134 = ~I offered him my soul in exchange for my niece's. You should not have returned here, Caelar. I hoped, I prayed you would learn from your mistake, that time would bring you wisdom and humility.~ [BD39134]
@39135 = ~All in vain. She never forgot her uncle's sacrifice. Never forgave herself for his loss. And never stopped seeking a way to restore him.~ [BD39135]
@39136 = ~No. NO! If I could have freed the Dragonspear dead, I would have.~ [BD39136]
@39137 = ~But you could not. No one could. And in your heart of hearts, you knew that.~ [BD39137]
@39138 = ~I never wanted you dead—I needed you alive. The men I sent to Baldur's Gate—good and righteous men—were meant to capture you. We—Hephernaan thought my aasimar blood might open the portal to Avernus, but its divine power had been diluted over generations. Despite the rumors, I am no spawn of Bhaal. We needed the blood of a god, or the next best thing—the child of a god's.~
@39139 = ~And we would get it, one way or another. Caelar knew her men's failure would bring you to her as surely as your capture. The hero of Baldur's Gate could not let such a provocation go unanswered.~
@39140 = ~You wanted my blood to free your uncle from a pit of hell—I can think of few goals more noble or worthy. I would have given it freely, Caelar, had you but asked.~
@39141 = ~You wanted me in Dragonspear, yet the Trade Way bridge was destroyed even as I sought to cross it. Why?~
@39142 = ~I see now it was not Caelar who sought to provoke me, but you, you and your accursed master. You wanted my blood to open the portal to Hell, and so it did. But you will never step over that threshold, not while I draw breath.~
@39143 = ~How many have scorned me these past months? How many believed it mad to open the portal to Avernus? I could not ask. I could not risk your refusal.~
@39144 = ~When the crusaders realized the hero approached the bridge unescorted by Caelar's elite, panic spread like wildfire. ~
@39145 = ~The bridge's destruction was intended to prevent those in Baldur's Gate from following you. Instead it put an obstacle 'twixt you and us. But you would not be turned you from your course.~
@39146 = ~And so I have a Bhaalspawn to add to my collection. You, Aun Argent, Caelar—all will be part of my menagerie of souls.~ [BD39146]
@39147 = ~When I offered her a way to free her uncle, she didn't hesitate. Thousands were killed or driven from their homes in her name. She did not waver. She would put all Toril to the torch to ensure Aun Argent's release.~ [BD39147]
@39148 = ~I wanted my uncle freed, yes. But if the Dragonspear dead could have been restored, I would have done so.~ [BD39148]
@39149 = ~You have defeated me. I see that now. But consider a moment the ways I might be of use to you.~ [BD39149]
@39150 = ~Caelar, no! Do not do this!~ [BD39150]
@39151 = ~You would serve me, Caelar Argent? You would be a blackguard in service to Belhifet?~ [BD39151]
@39152 = ~No, Caelar—you can't have fallen so far as that! Fight with me. Belhifet's death will be the first stone laid on the path to your redemption.~
@39153 = ~She's served you well enough thus far...~
@39154 = ~Blackguard or no, her fate was sealed the moment her men raised arms against me.~
@39155 = ~You DARE challenge the great Belhifet, here in his place of power?~ [BD39155]
@39156 = ~I'll not do it alone. Caelar! Join me! Let Belhifet's death be the first stepping stone on your path to redemption.~
@39157 = ~Well... Yeah.~
@39158 = ~I don't see that I have a lot in the way of options, at this point.~
@39159 = ~I give him the same choice I give all my prey: Flee or fall before me. Which would you prefer, devil?~
@39160 = ~After everything I've done, you would have me at your side...?~ [BD39160]
@39161 = ~You are as arrogant as my "mistress," <CHARNAME>. And you will share her fate!~ [BD39161]
@39162 = ~A Bhaalspawn is a valuable thing, one I'll not part with willingly. You, Aun Argent, and Caelar, all will be part of my menagerie.~ [BD39162]
@39163 = ~Everything I've done has been your will, Belhifet. I should rather face the truth than live in ignorance. Free my uncle, and I will be your faithful servant.~ [BD39163]
@39164 = ~Oh, my child, please, please don't do this...~ [BD39164]
@39165 = ~But I humbly beseech you, Lord Belhifet, grant your servant one other boon. Destroy Hephernaan.~ [BD39165]
@39166 = ~An Argent as my blackguard... Very well, Caelar. I shall do as you ask. And you shall do as I command—forever.~ [BD39166]
@39167 = ~Master, no, you cannot just cast me aside!~ [BD39167]
@39168 = ~Now, Caelar, my servant—prove yourself to me. Bring me the Bhaalspawn.~ [BD39168]
@39169 = ~Your journey is at an end, <CHARNAME>. Look upon my visage and see that I am your doom!~ [BD39169]
@39170 = ~I'll deal with that riddling wretch after you've joined the aasimar and her uncle in my menagerie of souls.~ [BD39170]
@39171 = ~You think I should fear you, then? Caelar? Her uncle? No, little Bhaalspawn, none of you concern me in the slightest. But you will make fine additions to my menagerie of souls.~ [BD39171]
@39172 = ~I never thought I'd see arrogance to match the Argent simpleton's. Pay the price of your foolishness!~ [BD39172]
@39173 = ~Pay the price for your treachery, Hephernaan!~ [BD39173]
@39174 = ~CAELAR! NO! ~ [BD39174]
@39175 = ~You followed in the aasimar's footsteps, Bhaalspawn. Now share her fate!~ [BD39175]
@39176 = ~At last I am free of that wretched cage. Tell me your name, friend, that I may thank you properly.~ [BD39176]
@39177 = ~I am <CHARNAME>.~
@39178 = ~Some call me the hero of Baldur's Gate. I wish they wouldn't, but there's no talking to some people. My name is <CHARNAME>.~
@39179 = ~<CHARNAME>. The <PRO_MANWOMAN> who slew Belhifet and ended the mad crusade of Caelar Argent.~
@39180 = ~I am called <CHARNAME>. And I am no friend of yours.~
@39181 = ~Forgive me; I do not recognize the name. Regardless, I am in your debt, <CHARNAME>. You have my thanks.~
@39182 = ~How long have you been in this foul place?~
@39183 = ~No apologies necessary. Were I in your place, I doubt I'd know my own name, let alone another's.~
@39184 = ~You will. In time, everyone in all the Hells will know the name of the slayer of Belhifet, hero of Baldur's Gate, the <PRO_MANWOMAN> who ended the Siege of Dragonspear the Shining Lady's mad crusade.~
@39185 = ~It felt like a thousand years, yet it could not have been. Caelar was ten when I saw her last—Caelar. Gods, no! NO!~
@39186 = ~Caelar. Gods, no. NO!~
@39187 = ~You slew Belhifet and freed me from my cage. Call yourself whatever pleases— Oh, gods. Caelar. CAELAR!~
@39188 = ~Aye. Belhifet was able to do little but torment his pets these past decades. He filled each second with a millennium's agony. My faith in Lathander let me survive the ordeal with mind intact, but I must admit that faith was sorely tested. Now where is my niece...?~
@39189 = ~The Shining Lady... Oh no. No. CAELAR!~
@39190 = ~I can scarcely believe it. Everything I did, every sacrifice I made, all to reach this moment... You are free at last, Uncle.~ [BD39190]
@39191 = ~I know not what you did to make this happen, Caelar. Whatever it was, the cost was too great.~ [BD39191]
@39192 = ~I have no family of my own, sir, but if I did, there is little I wouldn't do to save them.~
@39193 = ~You have no idea how right you are.~
@39194 = ~Tell him, Caelar. Tell him the price the Sword Coast bore that he might be freed from Belhifet's clutches.~
@39195 = ~I sacrificed myself to ensure my niece never saw this place again. You knew my wishes, Caelar. Why did you defy them?~ [BD39195]
@39196 = ~Do you think so little of me, Uncle? Did you truly believe I would leave you to rot in the devil's claws?~ [BD39196]
@39197 = ~I expected my niece to honor her uncle's wishes. How long has it been since we last spoke, Caelar? Have you learned nothing in all those years?~ [BD39197]
@39198 = ~What is this? Caelar and I have our differences, no question, but I am shocked by what I see here. Where is your gratitude?~
@39199 = ~I'm pretty sure she's learned quite a bit in the past few hours.~
@39200 = ~She learned much, though not, I think, the lessons you would have had her take from her experiences.~
@39201 = ~The better question is, where is mine?~ [BD39201]
@39202 = ~I was brought up in the Order of the Aster. My aasimar heritage and the Argent name assured me a place of honor as a paladin of the Morninglord. Or so I thought at the time. I had such confidence then. Such certainty of purpose. I knew I would rise to greatness, knew it in my bones.~ [BD39202]
@39203 = ~I had such confidence, then. Such certainty of purpose. I knew I would rise to greatness, knew it in my bones. The only thing stopping me were my superiors in the Order of the Aster.~
@39204 = ~All that barred my ascent were my superiors in the Order. They sought to teach me humility; I see that now. But I could not bring myself to bow to their authority. To any authority but Lathander's, perhaps not even his.~ [BD39204]
@39205 = ~I was told to watch over the library. To guard the volumes within, for they held knowledge critical to the order's success in the battle against darkness.~
@39206 = ~I was told to watch over the library. To guard the volumes within, for they held knowledge critical to the order's success in the battle against darkness. I coveted that knowledge. In my arrogance, I read aloud from the pages, not understanding the forces I was invoking...~ [BD39206]
@39207 = ~That was how a girl not yet ten years old found herself in this pit, in that cage.~ [BD39207]
@39208 = ~Yet you escaped its bars. You must have.~
@39209 = ~We all make mistakes.~
@39210 = ~Then you have experience in being caged. Good. It will serve you well when we return to the Material Plane.~
@39211 = ~I was freed, yes. But the cost... It was too much to bear. I couldn't do it, Uncle. Forgive me, I just—I couldn't.~ [BD39211]
@39212 = ~Aun offered himself to Belhifet in your place.~
@39213 = ~I begin to understand. Aun gave up his own freedom that yours might be restored. We should all have such an uncle.~
@39214 = ~You ask HIS forgiveness? Aun Argent is perhaps the one person who benefited from your lunatic crusade.~
@39215 = ~She had come here willingly, if in ignorance. By the Nine Hells' laws, she was Belhifet's. An innocent. An aasimar. An Argent. A soul with value beyond measure.~ [BD39215]
@39216 = ~All I could do was offer another soul, in trade. One without the stain of arrogance. One that was of the Argent line, of a paladin at the height of his powers.~ [BD39216]
@39217 = ~I made the sacrifice hoping that Caelar might someday find redemption for her sins. But she is here before me and I now know she chose another path.~ [BD39217]
@39218 = ~A heavy toll was paid, by me and those who followed me. A heavier one still was exacted from those who stood in my path. Am I without regret? No. Would I do it again? Without hesitation.~ [BD39218]
@39219 = ~Then you have learned nothing. Retribution is all that is left. You will return to the Material Plane, close the portal to Avernus, and stand trial for your crimes.~
@39220 = ~If you'd hesitated just once in your life, one time somewhere along the line, countless lives might have been spared.~
@39221 = ~I must admit, I'm impressed. You cling to righteousness as a hungry wolf does a piece of meat, without thought or doubt or any consideration of others.~
@39222 = ~I am an Argent. I hold myself to the highest standard. I know I did evil, though I did it in pursuit of good. I must answer for my crimes.~ [BD39222]
@39223 = ~You say he benefited from my actions? Were it not for me, my uncle would never have been caged.~ [BD39223]
@39224 = ~You may admire me or not, as you wish. I am an Argent. I hold myself to the highest standard. I know I did evil, though I did it in pursuit of good. I must answer for my crimes.~ [BD39224]
@39225 = ~And you will, once we're out of this damned inferno. Let's go.~ [BD39225]
@39226 = ~I do have family, and I would tear down the gates of all the Hells to spare them suffering.~ [BD39226]
@39227 = ~The paladin will see it for himself soon enough.~ [BD39227]
@39228 = ~Tell him of all those innocent men and women lost at B-bridgefort.~ [BD39228]
@39229 = ~I would have.~ [BD39229]
@39230 = ~This is not the great revelation you might think, my half-orc friend.~ [BD39230]
@39231 = ~Did I think you would leave me to Belhifet?~ [BD39231]
@39232 = ~We all learned much in that time, I think.~ [BD39232]
@39233 = ~This is a family affair, <CHARNAME>. Best not to meddle.~
@39234 = ~Hah! A Harper advising another not to interfere. There's not a dessert in all of Thay so rich as the irony that drips unwittingly from your full, luscious lips, Jaheira.~
@39235 = ~Every second we stand here talking, more devils make their way into Dragonspear. I don't mind talking, but the standing's at an end. Let's go.~ [BD39235]
@39236 = ~Might as well ask a fish not to swim. The orange lady is what she is.~ [BD39236]
@39237 = ~Lives are lost every day with no purpose that any but the gods can see. Those who sacrificed themselves in my name have saved a great man from an unjust fate.~ [BD39237]
@39238 = ~Evil done in a righteous cause is evil still.~ [BD39238]
@39239 = ~I have a couple uncles like that. It's pretty terrific, actually.~ [BD39239]
@39240 = ~Your grasp of the obvious is, as always, vice-like in its consistency, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD39240]
@39241 = ~More than I ever wanted to know. I knew no happiness in my ignorance, yet the misery I felt while convinced I trod a righteous path was nothing compared to the guilt I must carry now.~ [BD39241]
@39242 = ~Caelar, my child. What happened to you? I wanted to spare you this. I gave myself willingly that you might never again see this place.~ [BD39242]
@39243 = ~It was for you, Uncle. It was always for you. I sacrificed everything to see you freed from Belhifet's clutches...~
@39244 = ~I wanted to spare you this. I gave myself willingly that you might never again see this place.~
@39245 = ~And I gave myself so that you might see Toril once more. It was worth it, Uncle. It was all... worth it...~ [BD39245]
@39246 = ~Forgive me, Caelar. I did everything, everything I could, and still I failed you. ~ [BD39246]
@39247 = ~Forgive my impertinence, sir, but I don't believe that's even remotely true.~
@39248 = ~You failed her? How do you figure that?~
@39249 = ~But she did not fail you. You are free, from Belhifet's cage if not yet from Avernus.~
@39250 = ~There is nothing to forgive. You could not know the path that brought me here—the path I thought, HOPED would end with me in Belhifet's cage for the rest of eternity.~ [BD39250]
@39251 = ~Divine blood runs through the Argents, but it had lain dormant generations. In Caelar, the family's heritage shone bright as the sun for all to see. Red hair, topaz eyes, bronze skin... She was an aasimar, destined for great things. Like many of our family, like I myself, Caelar was raised in service to Lathander by the Order of the Aster.~ [BD39251]
@39252 = ~Like many of our family, like I myself, Caelar was raised in service to Lathander by the Order of the Aster. Even as a child, her talents were obvious. But she was a wilful girl, resentful of any who attempted to assert authority over her.~
@39253 = ~Even as a child, her talents were obvious. She was tasked to watch over the Order's library in Waterdeep—volumes that held the knowledge collected over its centuries of existence. But she was a willful girl, resentful of anyone asserting authority over her.~ [BD39253]
@39254 = ~Perhaps it was too much to expect a child of nine to simply stand guard over such forbidden lore. I question what we did now, but it seemed a simple matter, then...~ [BD39254]

@39272 = ~As a girl, she was tasked to watch over the Order of the Aster's library in Waterdeep. The volumes within held the knowledge collected over the Order's centuries of existence.~ [BD39272]
@39273 = ~This pit has left its mark on me. I will never be free of it. But let us leave, all the same.~ [BD39273]
@39274 = ~Sounds good to me. Let's go.~
@39275 = ~Forgive me, Master Argent, but we must leave this place. Belhifet's fallen, but the portal to Dragonspear is still open...~ [BD39275]
@39276 = ~It will not remain so for long.~ [BD39276]
@39277 = ~She paid the penalty for her hubris.~
@39278 = ~There is no consolation in that for me. But I shall grieve later. For now, let us be done with this place.~ [BD39278]
@39279 = ~Boo says the paths we choose will take us where we're meant to be.~ [BD39279]
@39280 = ~Ja. Be in good cheer! Soon, you will breathe unfouled air, feel wine upon your lips, take a lady to—well, maybe not that one. But these other pleasures await you.~ [BD39280]
@39281 = ~An idiotically noble gesture. Sounds about right.~ [BD39281]
@39282 = ~And child's play for the gargantuan hamster of space.~ [BD39282]
@39283 = ~Everyone get comfortable... I sense a story waiting to be told.~ [BD39283]
@39284 = ~Not on her own. Not from this place.~ [BD39284]

@39297 = ~If you expect me to waste time arguing with you over whether or not to leave this place, you'd best think again.~
@39298 = ~This is where we part ways, friend. Here, take this key I retrieved from Caelar's body. I know not what it opens, but I'm certain it's nothing in this infernal place.~
@39299 = ~I don't understand, Aun. We're not back to Dragonspear yet.~
@39300 = ~Seriously? After all you've endured, you would remain in Avernus?~
@39301 = ~If you expect me to waste time arguing with you over whether or not to leave this place, you'd best think again.~
@39302 = ~The portal cannot be closed from the Prime Material Plane. Someone must remain here to seal the door to Hell—and to guard it, holding the hordes of Avernus at bay should the rift between planes be opened again.~
@39303 = ~Then I shall do it.~
@39304 = ~I see. Farewell, then, Aun Argent. I'll see to it the world knows of the sacrifices you've made—for Toril and for Caelar.~
@39305 = ~It's your choice to make.~
@39306 = ~A generous offer, but few outside the Order of the Aster can perform the closing ritual. Go back from whence you came, I beg you, before Avernus's legions attack.~
@39307 = ~I'll not leave you to face this place alone.~
@39308 = ~May Lathander look kindly upon you, Aun Argent. Your sacrifice will not be forgotten.~
@39309 = ~You would face Avernus alone?~
@39310 = ~May it in some way redeem the Argent name. Fare thee well.~

@39314 = ~It's over, <CHARNAME>. Let's go.~
@39315 = ~Here, take this key. It will open the Dragonspear vault. I'll not be returning to Toril.~ [BD39315]
@39316 = ~What? No, Caelar, I'll not allow it.~ [BD39316]
@39317 = ~Nor will I. You will return to Toril, Mistress Argent. You must answer for your crimes.~
@39318 = ~You'd remain in this accursed place rather than face the Sword Coast's justice, Caelar? You fear the Council of Four and the Lords of Waterdeep more than you do the denizens of Avernus?~
@39319 = ~She is the one who brought you to this place, Aun Argent. She is the one who has nearly unleashed the hordes of Belhifet upon Toril. I can think of no more fitting punishment than her spending what remains of her life in this foul pit.~
@39320 = ~The rift 'twixt the planes was opened by me—not by my hand, but I am responsible nonetheless.~ [BD39320]
@39321 = ~The portal can only be closed from this side. Someone must remain behind. I shall sever Avernus's connection to Toril, and then stand guard. Whosoever would cross the threshold to Dragonspear will first face Caelar Argent.~ [BD39321]
@39322 = ~I can do nothing to change the past. What future I have is here, in this place. That was true from the moment I first summoned Belhifet. Uncle, please, go now, before Avernus's legions overtake us. Do what you can to redeem the Argent name of the shame I brought upon it, I beg you.~ [BD39322]
@39323 = ~Go now, uncle, before the legions of Avernus overtake us. Redeem the Argent name, I beg you.~

@39325 = ~And you, uncle. Now go!~
@39326 = ~It's over, <CHARNAME>. Let's go.~
@39327 = ~It's done. Thank the gods.~ [BD39327]
@39328 = ~The portal is closed. Voghiln needs a drink.~ [BD39328]
@39329 = ~Shar smiles upon you, <CHARNAME>. I don't know why.~ [BD39329]
@39330 = ~The portal is closed once again. Thank Selûne.~ [BD39330]

@39333 = ~The rift 'twixt the worlds is closed.~ [BD39333]
@39334 = ~The portal is closed. Let's get that vault door open. I would speak with Torsin de Lancie about his decision to lock me in here with the hordes of the Hells.~ [BD39334]
@39335 = ~Nowhere to go but up. ~
@39336 = ~It's a sad state of affairs that a dreary vault has as much appeal as this one now does.~ [BD39336]
@39337 = ~I went to Avernus and came back. I really did. And nobody who wasn't here will ever believe it...~ [BD39337]
@39338 = ~Eh. Our Avernal victory won't mean very much till we vacate this vile vault.~ [BD39338]
@39339 = ~Hellhole's closed. That's good. Still trapped, though. That's not so good.~ [BD39339]
@39340 = ~The rift between the planes is healed. Avernus's threat to Toril is ended.~
@39341 = ~It is d-done. Avernus will threaten us no more.~ [BD39341]
@39342 = ~You were as good as your word, and I shall be no less. I shall arrange the transfer of my lands to you as soon as I am able. ~
@39343 = ~We would not have survived Avernus but for you and your friend. I owe you a debt I shall never be able to repay. ~

@39347 = ~Caelar is dead. The portal to Avernus is closed.~
@39348 = ~The portal to Avernus is closed.~
@39349 = ~That is a very long story.~
@39350 = ~I imagine you've quite a tale to tell.~ [BD39350]
@39351 = ~More than one. In the hands of any bard worthy of the title, the machinations of Caelar, Hephernaan, and the devil Belhifet would be fodder for any number of epics.~
@39352 = ~I'll leave the telling to others. What happened while I... well, not to put too fine a point on it, but while I was saving the world from the forces of Hell?~
@39353 = ~I just told it. How goes the siege?~
@39354 = ~Our forces are sweeping the castle now, checking for traps or pockets of resistance. The surviving crusaders have either fled or surrendered. The siege is ended, as is the threat of the Nine Hells. I believe the time has come to celebrate.~ [BD39354]
@39355 = ~We are triumphant, then.~
@39356 = ~So it's over.~
@39357 = ~The crusade will crumble without its leader. This business is done.~
@39358 = ~The siege is over. The celebration has yet to begin.~
@39359 = ~Music to mine ears. Someone give Voghiln a drink!~ [BD39359]
@39360 = ~And what of our Shining Lady?~ [BD39360]
@39361 = ~Torsin de Lancie of Waterdeep, let me introduce you to Aun Argent, knight of the Order of the Aster. I'll let him tell you what's happened to Caelar.~
@39362 = ~Outside of the tales that will doubtless be told of her rise and fall, we'll hear no more of the Shining Lady.~
@39363 = ~The crusade's mistress fell before me, as all who oppose me ultimately do.~
@39364 = ~It is an honor to make your acquaintance, Master Argent. I wish it were under different circumstances. If there is anything I can do for you, please don't hesitate to let me know.~ [BD39364]
@39365 = ~Ja, it's some pretty good stuff.~ [BD39365]
@39366 = ~I look forward to hearing it.~ [BD39366]
@39367 = ~Is that all you've got for the savior of Dragonspear? You can do better than that! Three cheers for the hero of Baldur's Gate!~ [BD39367]
@39368 = ~You know what you must do. ~
@39369 = ~Embrace the darkness that flows within you. ~
@39370 = ~Even now, you resist. You are more powerful than I thought. ~
@39371 = ~No matter. All that I truly require is your presence.~
@39372 = ~What the hells—? No—gods, NO!~ [BD39372]
@39373 = ~What have you done, <CHARNAME>? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?~ [BD39373]
@39374 = ~There was a monster—it attacked me!~
@39375 = ~I—I don't know.~
@39376 = ~That seems obvious. The better question is why I might have done it.~
@39377 = ~There's only one monster here—the one that stood on Boareskyr Bridge, a skull scorched into the stone around her. The one covered in Skie Silvershield's blood.~ [BD39377]
@39378 = ~You killed the daughter of a Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate. Gods help you—no one else will be able to.~ [BD39378]
@39379 = ~May the gods help you. No one else will.~ [BD39379]
@39380 = ~I wish that I could.~
@39381 = ~Slow down now—I didn't kill anyone!~
@39382 = ~Skie Silvershield was hardly an innocent.~
@39383 = ~And now you mock your victim? Are you without shame?~
@39384 = ~You call Skie Silvershield "no one"? Your villainy is without end!~
@39385 = ~I see it now. You stood in the fiery skull and tears scorched upon the bridge of Boareskyr. Now you stand in the blood of the innocent. You truly are your father's child, aren't you?~
@39386 = ~I hope you've got a good explanation for this, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD39386]
@39387 = ~I know how this looks, Corwin, but I swear to you I'm innocent.~
@39388 = ~I was asleep and then I woke up and came in here and Skie wasn't here, it was a, a, a monster—an unspeakable horror! I don't know what happened.~
@39389 = ~I'll not explain myself, to you or anyone.~
@39390 = ~I want to believe you. I really do.~
@39391 = ~If you know how it looks, then you know why I have trouble believing you.~
@39392 = ~Keep talking like that and you'll face the headsman's axe—if you last that long. I doubt Duke Silvershield's justice will wait for the law to catch up to it.~
@39393 = ~Well, you better figure out what happened and be quick about it. Duke Silvershield's justice may not wait on the law.~
@39394 = ~Baravar's fog! We'd won—we'd won! What could have possessed you to do this, <CHARNAME>? Tell me, why?~ [BD39394]
@39395 = ~Tell me you did not do this, my friend. I beg you, tell me this is not what it appears to be.~ [BD39395]
@39396 = ~I never knew you had it in you, <CHARNAME>. I knew you had something within you, but this? No.~ [BD39396]
@39397 = ~Someone fetch me some ale. Lots of ale, and quick! I would blot this horror from mine mind. Poor, poor lass.~ [BD39397]
@39398 = ~This can't be. I can't believe it. I WON'T believe it. This must be a... a ruse of some sort. Gorion can't have been wrong!~
@39399 = ~You did a lot for me, <CHARNAME>. I—I wish I could help you. I think I gotta get out of here.~ [BD39399]
@39400 = ~You cretinous baboon! We had the world ready to kneel before us and kiss our feet, and you go and do this? You've ruined everything!~ [BD39400]
@39401 = ~Why did you d-do this? There must be s-s-some other explanation, <CHARNAME>. Tell me, please, I-I-I have to know!~ [BD39401]
@39402 = ~A brutal, bloody business—this bad behavior blemishes the biography of Baldur's Gate's best.~ [BD39402]
@39403 = ~Avert your eyes, Boo! We cannot see our friend in such a shamed state! No space hamster should be exposed to such a scene.~ [BD39403]
@39404 = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, have you lost your mind, or did you not actually have a mind to begin with and I somehow missed it...?~ [BD39404]
@39405 = ~It is hard for me to believe, yet... I see it with mine own eyes. Am I deceived? Thou hast shed innocent blood as thou didst villains', and in the doing, thou hast made thyself a villain.~ [BD39405]
@39406 = ~I see I was not the only one who found the wench's incessant whining grating. Even so, I'm glad you struck the killing blow. I've had my fill of cages.~ [BD39406]
@39407 = ~I think I'm going to be sick. This can't really be happening, right? You didn't... actually... and in front of everyone!~
@39408 = ~This is it, "hero." Journey's end. Well, almost the end. There'll be a trial, of course, but Silvershield won't rest till you breathe your last. ~
@39409 = ~Listen to me, please. I didn't kill Skie Silvershield. I've been falsely accused.~
@39410 = ~You think this is the end? Well, perhaps you're right. It'd be a relief if it were.~
@39411 = ~Caelar Argent fell because of me. You should thank me for that, no matter what crime I'm falsely accused of.~
@39412 = ~Falsely accused my prodigious backside. They say you were covered in her blood. ~
@39413 = ~I didn't do it. I could never commit such a heinous crime.~
@39414 = ~My stink? When was the last time YOU had a bath?~
@39415 = ~Believe what you will, dog. Your opinion means nothing.~
@39416 = ~Maybe so, but I heard what happened at Boareskyr Bridge. The symbol of Bhaal? You're no different from Sarevok.~
@39417 = ~Skie Silvershield was a spoiled brat, and everyone knows it. But she was the daughter of one of the Council, and no one deserves what she got. I'll watch you hang, and smile to see your body twitch at the end of that rope.~
@39418 = ~Clever words won't change the facts. I know what happened at Boareskyr Bridge. The Lord of Murder is reborn in you. Or he would be if you weren't gonna die.~
@39419 = ~Good morning, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD39419]
@39420 = ~Is it morning? It's hard to tell in here.~
@39421 = ~You're half right. Why have you come here?~
@39422 = ~What do you want, traitor?~
@39423 = ~You call me a traitor? That's rich. ~
@39424 = ~I am accused of a senseless murder and none defend me. I am betrayed by all I once cared for.~
@39425 = ~Why are you here?~
@39426 = ~After everything we've endured, everything I've done for this damned city, you believe I murdered Skie Silvershield. I called you traitor, but treachery I might forgive. Stupidity is another matter.~
@39427 = ~That's not entirely true. Your friend, Imoen has been quite vocal speaking in your defense.~
@39428 = ~Not true. Your friend Imoen has been hounding the Grand Dukes relentlessly, begging them to pardon you.~
@39429 = ~Thank the gods, someone believes me.~
@39430 = ~Imoen! Damn me, in all the uproar, I hadn't given her a moment's consideration. How is she?~
@39431 = ~An innocent <PRO_MANWOMAN> should need no pardon.~
@39432 = ~Fully recovered from the wounds she took at the crusade's hands. Your circumstances cut her deeper than that, though.~
@39433 = ~I must see her.~
@39434 = ~Damn it. She probably blames herself for all this... Can I talk to her?~
@39435 = ~She'll survive.~
@39436 = ~Duke Belt doesn't believe she'd willingly leave here without you. He can't allow that, no matter how much he might wish otherwise. For her sake, she must stay away.~
@39437 = ~I'm not here to discuss the time. I'm here to ask you to end this madness. The city's endured much of late—the iron crisis, Sarevok, the crusade... Now this.~
@39438 = ~I'm here to ask you to end this madness. The city's endured much of late—the iron crisis, Sarevok, the crusade... Now this.~
@39439 = ~The dark days must end. And they won't, not with you languishing here claiming innocence. If you care for Baldur's Gate, even a little... admit your crime. Accept the punishment given you.~
@39440 = ~I've fought and bled for Baldur's Gate. I've nearly died for it more times than I can count. I care about the city—but I also care about justice.~
@39441 = ~I'd be more than happy to declare my innocence while languishing somewhere else.~
@39442 = ~You'd have me throw myself on the sword for what? The benefit of those who betrayed me?~
@39443 = ~Maybe you are innocent. Maybe the eyes of all those who saw you standing over Skie's corpse deceived them. It doesn't matter. The city is all that matters now. My father taught me that a hero—a real hero—is prepared to sacrifice <PRO_HIMHER>self for the greater good. They called you the hero of Baldur's Gate. Now you have the chance to earn the name.~
@39444 = ~My father taught me that a hero—a real hero—is prepared to sacrifice <PRO_HIMHER>self for the greater good. They called you the hero of Baldur's Gate. Now you have the chance to earn the name.~
@39445 = ~You don't get it, do you? You can't see beyond yourself to understand what's truly at stake here. This isn't about you. It's about Baldur's Gate. The city's been through so much of late—the iron crisis, Sarevok, the crusade... and now this.~
@39446 = ~I'm not here to talk about Imoen. I came to ask you to end this madness. The city's endured much of late—the iron crisis, Sarevok, the crusade... Now this.~
@39447 = ~She has the luxury of doubt. She wasn't there. She didn't see you standing over the body, a bloody dagger in hand...~
@39448 = ~For the benefit of those who still believe in you. They called you the hero of Baldur's Gate. A true hero will sacrifice <PRO_HIMHER>self for the greater good. Give the city a chance to heal. Please.~
@39449 = ~My father told me not to come here. My superior officer ordered me to stay away from you. They're right, I know they are, yet here I stand. ~
@39450 = ~The heart has its way with the best of us.~
@39451 = ~You shouldn't be here, Schael. I don't want you to see me like this.~
@39452 = ~And here I rot, accused of a crime I didn't commit.~
@39453 = ~I don't love you. I barely even know you. ~
@39454 = ~Yet there you stand. Why have you come here, Schael?~
@39455 = ~I'm easier to love when you don't know me. Free me. Open this cage. We'll leave Baldur's Gate, go someplace no one knows us.~
@39456 = ~So you believe I did what they accuse me of?~
@39457 = ~I had to see you, one last time. ~
@39458 = ~I'm glad you did.~
@39459 = ~Get out of here. Please go, before your commander finds you've disobeyed him. Take care of Rohma. Live a good life. Forget you ever knew me.~
@39460 = ~It doesn't need to be the last time. Free me. We'll leave Baldur's Gate, go someplace no one knows us.~
@39461 = ~I wish I could. I do. Were it just you and me, I might take you up on your offer. But I have a family, and a duty. I cannot turn my back on them. ~
@39462 = ~I should never have suggested you abandon your family. Forgive me.~
@39463 = ~Then go, quickly, before your commander learns you've disobeyed him. Take care of Rohma. Live a good life. Forget you ever knew me.~
@39464 = ~So you turn your back on me.~
@39465 = ~This was a mistake.~
@39466 = ~I'll never forget you.~
@39467 = ~I want to believe you, <CHARNAME>. I thought—I don't know what I thought.~
@39468 = ~I saw you there. I saw you standing over Skie Silvershield's body, a bloody dagger in hand. You're a child of Bhaal. What am I supposed to think?~
@39469 = ~What does your heart tell you?~
@39470 = ~You're supposed to think I'm innocent. You're supposed to think that because I AM innocent.~
@39471 = ~Think what you will of me. I no longer care.~
@39472 = ~I've lived long enough to know better than to listen to my heart.~
@39473 = ~I'm not. This was a mistake. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I'm so sorry.~
@39474 = ~I can forgive you that easily enough. Skie Silvershield, though... You broke my heart, <CHARNAME>.~
@39475 = ~My eyes saw what they saw. But my heart—it knows what it knows. There was a time, when I was younger, before I had to think of Rohma or my father, there was a time that would have been enough. That time is past.~
@39476 = ~This is it, "hero." Journey's end, or near enough, at any rate. Silvershield won't rest till you breathe your last.~ [BD39476]
@39477 = ~You can't believe I did this, Duncan. I DIDN'T kill Skie.~
@39478 = ~You think this is the end? Well, perhaps you're right. It'd be a relief if it were.~
@39479 = ~Then he'd best get used to being tired.~
@39480 = ~Tell it to the magistrate, <CHARNAME>. I was there. I SAW you covered in her blood.~ [BD39480]
@39481 = ~I really don't.~
@39482 = ~Oh, right. You're... Duncan, is that right?~
@39483 = ~You flatter yourself. You shouldn't.~
@39484 = ~Clerics have been trying to revive Skie from the moment we found her body, but her soul is gone, destroyed by some foul magic. Bhaal's stink lingers over the whole thing. YOUR stink.~ [BD39484]
@39485 = ~I regret her loss more than you can imagine.~
@39486 = ~You do me a disservice, Duncan. After everything I sacrificed in the name of this city, how could you believe me capable of this heinous crime?~
@39487 = ~Believe what you will, dog. Your opinion means nothing.~
@39488 = ~There was so much I thought I had to say to you. But all those words on the tip of my tongue, the lofty speech I rehearsed every spare second since we left Dragonspear—they're gone. So I'll just say this, then: I'll enjoy watching you die. And I'll not be alone in that.~ [BD39488]
@39489 = ~How could I resist the opportunity to see the great hero of Baldur's Gate laid low? You killed a lot of people, <CHARNAME>.~
@39490 = ~I just wanted you to know that.~
@39491 = ~She was a good woman. A good soldier. A great leader. And she died for you. She died BECAUSE of you, like so many others have.~
@39492 = ~Me? I'm fine this morning. I've never been better. Do you know why I'm so happy this morning? I'll tell you: because it finds you chained in a cell. A cell you'll only leave to face justice. Not just for Skie, but for all the people you've gotten killed. People like Schael Corwin.~
@39493 = ~I'll tell you: because it finds you chained in a cell. A cell you'll only leave to face justice. Not just for Skie Silvershield, but for all the people you've gotten killed. People like Schael Corwin.~
@39494 = ~I warned you. I told you what would happen if you failed to deal with the taint of Bhaal. ~
@39495 = ~You! How did you get in here? Who ARE you?~
@39496 = ~I don't understand how this happened. Nothing makes sense.~
@39497 = ~You foresaw my fall, but did nothing to stop it. Were I not in this cell I'd strangle the life from you!~
@39498 = ~I am just a man who sought to help you escape a dark fate. I failed.~
@39499 = ~Bhaal's power overwhelmed you. His lust for murder led to Skie Silvershield's death at your hand.~
@39500 = ~You are your father's creature, now and forever.~
@39501 = ~But you are in a cell. For too long, you have tried to ignore the reality of your situation. Now it is inescapable.~
@39502 = ~It makes perfect sense. The logic is inescapable, the proof irrefutable.~
@39503 = ~Rise. It is time.~
@39504 = ~You know what you must do. Embrace the darkness that flows within you.~
@39505 = ~Take the dagger. Kill her.~
@39506 = ~Take it.~
@39507 = ~Even now, you resist. You are more powerful than I thought.~
@39508 = ~No matter. In truth, all I require is your presence.~
@39509 = ~You will have no allies now. No friends to save you. You will be cast out, as all who threaten the natural order are cast out.~
@39510 = ~And when you are cast out, we will meet again.~
@39511 = ~You are lost. Follow my voice. Come back to me. ~
@39512 = ~What happened? What did you see? ~
@39513 = ~I saw Skie Silvershield die. I saw the face of her killer.~
@39514 = ~You set me up. You killed Skie Silvershield.~
@39515 = ~I saw your death.~
@39516 = ~So you know the truth—despite my efforts, you remember. Most impressive. A pity it will not protect you from the justice of the Grand Dukes. ~
@39517 = ~Nor will it protect you from MY justice.~
@39518 = ~The truth will come out. Maybe not today or tomorrow, perhaps not in my lifetime—probably not in my lifetime, considering how abbreviated it's likely to be. But somehow, someday, you will pay for what you've done.~
@39519 = ~I'll find a way out of here. And when I do, I'll find you. The day is coming, fiend. Your end is nearer than you know.~
@39520 = ~There are few more acutely aware of their own vulnerability than I.~
@39521 = ~I hope you do escape this place. There is much we could accomplish together. Farewell.~
@39522 = ~Tell me more.~
@39523 = ~You killed Skie Silvershield. I won't let you get away with it.~
@39524 = ~I'll do you one better than that. When the time comes, I'll show you, you traitorous bastard!~
@39525 = ~I saw you die, screaming, at my hand. I saw myself look down on your corpse, and laugh, for my vengeance was complete. You had paid for your crimes against me—paid for Skie's murder with your own wretched life!~
@39526 = ~Am I supposed to fear your justice? I've taken greater liberties with beings of greater power than you. Your words are nothing but the hollow bravado of the doomed.~
@39527 = ~Perhaps you are right. Perhaps not. There are some truths only time can tell. Farewell. I fear we shall not meet again.~
@39528 = ~Hey—hey, wake up. Wake up and move your ass while you still got an ass to move.~ [BD39528]
@39529 = ~What's going on?~

@39533 = ~Who are you?~
@39534 = ~I'm not going anywhere.~
@39535 = ~This is your time, is it? How do you figure that?~
@39536 = ~Don't matter. What matters is the bag o' gold your friend Imoen gave me to get you outta here, and the four other bags o' gold she's givin' me when I pull it off.~ [BD39536]
@39537 = ~Imoen sent you? Where is she?~
@39538 = ~FIVE bags of gold? I hope she doesn't expect me to pay her back.~

@39540 = ~I just said that, didn't I? ~
@39541 = ~Where is she?~
@39542 = ~How do I know you're telling the truth?~
@39543 = ~This is a jailbreak, then? Running away isn't my style.~
@39544 = ~A jailbreak, that's what's goin' on. Yer friend Imoen's payin' me t' get you out o' here. And quite handsomely, I might add. C'mon, we gotta move. Yer stuff—whatever the stickier Fists haven't purloined—is on a table in the central chamber.~ [BD39544]
@39545 = ~C'mon, we gotta move.~
@39546 = ~Is getting cut down by Entar Silvershield yer style? 'Cuz that's the only Plan B you've got. C'mon, we gotta move.~ [BD39546]
@39547 = ~You know who says that? Everyone that's ever been accused of a crime ever. It won't save yer neck. C'mon, we gotta move. Yer stuff—what the stickier Fists haven't made off with—is on a table in the central chamber.~ [BD39547]
@39548 = ~Oh, you're goin' somewhere. Yer friend Imoen's payin' me t' get you out o' here, and quite handsomely, I might add. You wanna live, you'll come with me now. Move it!~
@39549 = ~The girl's waitin' fer ya, 'long with my gold. So let's go!~ [BD39549]
@39550 = ~My time, your time, whoever's time it is, we don't got much of it. Yer friend Imoen's payin' me t' get you out o' here, and quite handsomely, I might add. You wanna live, you'll come with me now. Move it!~ [BD39550]
@39551 = ~Take it up with her, AFTER I've been paid. Let's go! Yer things're in the central chamber. You can pick 'em up on the way out.~ [BD39551]
@39552 = ~How do you—? You want out o' this place or not?~ [BD39552]
@39553 = ~I do.~
@39554 = ~I don't need to get out. I'm innocent.~
@39555 = ~You would have me flee? Running away isn't my style.~
@39556 = ~Let me out! Please, I can help you!~
@39557 = ~Guards! Guards! The slayer of Silvershield has escaped!~
@39558 = ~I didn't do it either, hero! Don't leave me here! DON'T LEAVE ME HERE!~
@39559 = ~Sure, good, that's just great—run away, leave the rest of us here to rot.~
@39560 = ~Ya can't go out that way. Well, you can, but only in chains, an' I doubt you'd live long after. Follow me.~
@39561 = ~Well, you can, but only in chains an' I doubt you'd live long once you went through. Follow me.~
@39562 = ~Over here. You can get out through the basement.~ [BD39562]
@39563 = ~What happened to the guards?~
@39564 = ~Wait, slow down. Who ARE you?~
@39565 = ~And then what?~
@39566 = ~They came down with a severe case o' slit throat. Come on, let's get outta here.~ [BD39566]
@39567 = ~I'm the guy try'na save yer arse, and you aren't making it easy. Move it!~
@39568 = ~Then we escape and you get to see yer girlie again.~
@39569 = ~We are not involved; Imoen is like a sister to me. It would be too strange.~
@39570 = ~You think Imoen and I are lovers? Where'd you get that from?~
@39571 = ~Imoen and I are friends, nothing more. I'd rather we weren't even that, as often as not.~
@39572 = ~That's fascinating, it really and truly is. Can we leave now, please?~ [BD39572]
@39573 = ~Whatever she is to you, if you ever wanna see her again, get into the basement.~
@39574 = ~Someone's gonna realize ye're gone an' then we'll be done for. Get movin'!~
@39575 = ~Are you sure it was Imoen who hired you?~
@39576 = ~This doesn't add up. Something here doesn't make sense...~
@39577 = ~I'll move when I'm ready. Now be silent.~
@39578 = ~The only thing doesn't make sense here is I'm offerin' you a way out of this hellhole and you're dawdling around admirin' the decor. When ye're ready t'go, come find me.~
@39579 = ~Awright, Yer Highness. I'll await yer pleasure down in the basement then, shall I? Bloody hells. Ya try an' help someone an' this is the thanks you get...~
@39580 = ~Bloody hells. You try an' help someone an' this is the thanks you get...~
@39581 = ~The only thing I'm sure of right this second is that the longer we fiddle around here, the less likely it is I'm gonna get paid. Now come on!~
@39582 = ~Through here.~ [BD39582]
@39583 = ~Where does this go?~
@39584 = ~A secret exit in the basement of the Flaming Fist's headquarters? Gods, I love this city...~
@39585 = ~Enough! I'll not be herded about like some mindless farm animal.~
@39586 = ~The sewers. When you get down, there's a waterfall to the east. Under it, there's a lake in a cavern. Imoen'll be waitin' for ya at the cave entrance. Got it? Good.~ [BD39586]
@39587 = ~Well, the city don't love you no more. Now listen: When ya get down, there's a waterfall to the east, flows down into a lake in a cavern. You'll find Imoen near the entrance.~ [BD39587]
@39588 = ~Then stick around an' get slaughtered like one. Your choice.~
@39589 = ~Now go, quickly!~
@39590 = ~Using the sewers to escape justice might have worked for Sarevok, murderer, but you'll not be so lucky.~
@39591 = ~I am no murderer. I don't want to fight you.~
@39592 = ~You want to fight a murderer in a confined space? In what world does that make any kind of sense?~
@39593 = ~Save your breath, fool. It will be your last.~
@39594 = ~I'll give you this, traitor—you've chosen a fit place to die!~
@39595 = ~Please! I'm innocent; you must believe me!~
@39596 = ~Would you be so kind as to point me in a way that does have an escape?~
@39597 = ~Words won't stop me. What else have you got?~
@39598 = ~For Skie Silvershield—DIE!~
@39599 = ~Your glib tongue won't save you. For Skie Silvershield—DIE!~
@39600 = ~You dare plead innocence? I'll not hear your lies. For Skie Silvershield—DIE!~
@39601 = ~Crawling through others' leavings to escape Baldur's Gate justice? You really are no different from Sarevok, are you?~
@39602 = ~Justice for Silvershield! Die! ~
@39603 = ~I'll have your head off, you scum! ~
@39604 = ~There's no escape for you. ~
@39605 = ~Lord Eltan's ordered your death—accept your fate! ~
@39606 = ~I'll see you dead, monster!~
@39607 = ~Silvershield will pay handsomely for the head of his daughter's killer. ~
@39608 = ~No one escapes the Flaming Fist! ~
@39609 = ~This is for Skie Silvershield! ~
@39610 = ~Surrender and I'll end you quick.~
@39611 = ~You betrayed us! You betrayed all of Baldur's Gate! Die, "hero"!~
@39612 = ~No escape for you, scum. The only place you're going is a cell—or your grave!~
@39613 = ~Hands in the air. Get away from the opening.~ [BD39613]
@39614 = ~I don't want to fight you, Corwin. I'm INNOCENT. You have to believe me!~
@39615 = ~Schael, please, I beg you, don't do this. I love you.~
@39616 = ~You would prevent my escape? I thought we had something, you and I.~
@39617 = ~After all we've been through, this is what it comes to. I should have known you'd betray me in the end.~
@39618 = ~Don't try to stop me, Corwin. I need to get out of here if I'm to have any chance of proving my innocence.~
@39619 = ~And if I don't, what will you do? Cut me down? Is that any worse than what I can expect from Entar Silvershield?~
@39620 = ~You think I want to do this? You think this isn't killing me? We should be together in my bedchamber or a meadow under a cloudless blue sky—ANYWHERE but here!~ [BD39620]
@39621 = ~But here we are. I have a job to do. You know me. You know I can't let you go.~ [BD39621]
@39622 = ~This is madness. I tell you I'm INNOCENT. You have to believe me!~
@39623 = ~I know who murdered Skie. Come with me. Help me find him.~
@39624 = ~You know what I'm capable of, Corwin. Please, don't try to stop me.~
@39625 = ~Rohma's already lost a father. Don't make her lose a mother too.~
@39626 = ~You'd have me turn my back on the Fist? On my family?~ [BD39626]
@39627 = ~I hoped to talk you out of this madness, but I see words alone won't get this job done. All right then. Let's go.~ [BD39627]
@39628 = ~Let's go.~
@39629 = ~Under the circumstances, I wouldn't be so quick to assume.~
@39630 = ~This is madness. I tell you I'm INNOCENT. You have to believe me!~
@39631 = ~I didn't do it. You must know that.~
@39632 = ~I need to go past you—it's my only way out of here. Please, don't try to stop me. You know what I'm capable of.~
@39633 = ~Think about Rohma, Corwin. She's already lost a father. Don't make her lose a mother too.~
@39634 = ~I know what I saw. You were standing over the body of Skie Silvershield. Duke Entar's daughter. His DAUGHTER.~ [BD39634]
@39635 = ~Ah. I understand now. This is about Rohma.~
@39636 = ~Do you truly believe me so mad that I would, that I could even be capable of doing this thing I'm accused of? Do you truly think so little of me?~
@39637 = ~And how many people have you slain, Corwin? Everyone is someone's child.~
@39638 = ~I'm not going to argue with you, Captain. I will, however, kill you, if you don't get out of my way.~
@39639 = ~Have I killed before? Yes—but never a defenseless girl. Never in cold blood. Never without cause. Don't give me cause now. Surrender.~ [BD39639]
@39640 = ~Don't give me cause now, <CHARNAME>. Please. Surrender.~
@39641 = ~...Very well. I didn't kill Skie Silvershield, whatever you may believe. But I'll not make an orphan of your daughter.~
@39642 = ~I don't WANT to fight you, but I will, if you make me.~
@39643 = ~Never. Not while this body still draws breath.~
@39644 = ~Don't bring her into this. You won't like where that ends.~ [BD39644]
@39645 = ~I've done things I regret in my life, Schael. Making an orphan of Rohma won't be one of them. I surrender.~
@39646 = ~Listen, just listen to me, please. Do you truly believe me so mad that I would, that I could even be capable of doing this thing I'm accused of? Do you truly think so little of me?~
@39647 = ~Rohma's already lost one parent, Captain Corwin. Don't let your pride cost her another.~
@39648 = ~It's the right thing to do. On your knees. Hands behind your head.~
@39649 = ~I know EXACTLY what you're capable of. I've seen it. Now put your hands behind your head and get on your knees or by the gods I swear I will put you down.~ [BD39649]
@39650 = ~If that's the only way to end this... Very well. I didn't kill Skie Silvershield. I'll not have your death on my conscience.~
@39651 = ~I don't WANT to fight you, Corwin. But I will, if you make me. If you make me, I will kill you.~
@39652 = ~Not while I still draw breath.~
@39653 = ~Even if that's true, running away won't put anything right. ~
@39654 = ~You're right. I know it.~
@39655 = ~It might stop things getting worse. For a time, at least.~
@39656 = ~It can scarcely make things worse.~
@39657 = ~Do you have any idea what you've done? Any clue how much chaos the Silvershield murder has caused? The city's tearing itself apart because of you. It has to stop. It HAS to.~
@39658 = ~The city's tearing itself apart. It has to stop. It HAS to. And it won't until someone pays for what happened at Dragonspear. If you know anything about me, anything at all, you know I can't let you go.~ [BD39658]
@39659 = ~Very well. For the sake of the city that once called me hero, I surrender.~
@39660 = ~This is madness. I tell you I'm INNOCENT. You have to believe me!~
@39661 = ~You know what I'm capable of, Corwin. Please, don't try to stop me.~
@39662 = ~Rohma's already lost a father, Captain Corwin. Would you have her lose a mother too?~
@39663 = ~Then you surrender? ~
@39664 = ~If that's the only way to end this... Yes. I surrender.~
@39665 = ~I don't WANT to fight you, Corwin. Please don't make me. Please.~
@39666 = ~That will never happen.~
@39667 = ~Damn you, <CHARNAME>...! All right, then. Let's go.~ [BD39667]
@39668 = ~You threaten my daughter, <CHARNAME>? You just made your last mistake. Take <PRO_HIMHER>!~ [BD39668]
@39669 = ~It has to stop. It HAS to. And that won't happen until you answer for Skie. Now get on your knees, hands behind your head. Do it.~ [BD39669]
@39670 = ~If that's the only way to end this... Very well. I surrender. I didn't kill Skie Silvershield. I'll not kill you.~
@39671 = ~I don't WANT to fight you, but I will, if you make me. Don't do this. ~
@39672 = ~Think about your family, Captain. Think of Rohma. Walk away from this; leave me to deal with these others. No one ever has to know.~
@39673 = ~What I believe doesn't matter anymore. You tried to escape. And now we have to do what we must. Let's go.~ [BD39673]
@39674 = ~Thank the gods... On your knees, hands behind your head.~ [BD39674]
@39675 = ~No—no! It's not enough. She has to die! Die in the name of Skie Silvershield! Kill her!~ [BD39675]
@39676 = ~Damn it, Duncan! Run, <CHARNAME>! The cavern beyond the opening will get you out of the city! Go!~
@39677 = ~It's over, <CHARNAME>. There's no way out of this. ~
@39678 = ~I didn't do it, Duncan. I didn't kill the girl.~
@39679 = ~There's always a way out. Right now you're standing in front of mine.~
@39680 = ~I can go past you or through you. Which would you prefer?~
@39681 = ~It's over, <CHARNAME>. Come away from the edge of the falls. You'll find nothing but death beyond them.~ [BD39681]
@39682 = ~You've got to let me go, Duncan. I know who murdered Skie now. I need to find him.~
@39683 = ~Skie Silvershield is dead, much as I'd wish it otherwise. Are you really so eager to join her?~
@39684 = ~And that is worse than what awaits me on this side of it?~
@39685 = ~No. But on this side, you die at MY hand. Cut her down! For Grand Duke Silvershield and the Flaming Fist!~ [BD39685]
@39686 = ~But I liked her, in spite of all that. She deserved better than what she got from you. Schael Corwin deserved better too.~
@39687 = ~As it pleases you, so long as you DO die. Take her! Death to the enemies of Baldur's Gate!~ [BD39687]
@39688 = ~Of course you'd say that.~
@39689 = ~This is about more than a girl now. Half the city wants you drawn and quartered; the other is ready to revolt on your behalf. Baldur's Gate survived Sarevok, the iron crisis, and Caelar's crusade... I'll not let it fall on your account.~ [BD39689]
@39690 = ~I would die for this city—I nearly have more times than I care to count. But I won't die for a crime I didn't commit.~
@39691 = ~The city's bigger than any one <PRO_MANWOMAN>. It will survive this. So will I.~
@39692 = ~You'll not live long enough to see what happens either way, fool.~
@39693 = ~You're half right.~ [BD39693]
@39694 = ~Here's an action for you—!~
@39695 = ~If you won't go back, you WILL go down.~
@39696 = ~We'll see about that soon enough! Cut him down! Let him feel the wrath of the Flaming Fist!~ [BD39696]
@39697 = ~Heya! Over here! ~
@39698 = ~You made it! That's great, I was—I was scared you wouldn't.~ [BD39698]
@39699 = ~It is good to see you again, Imoen.~
@39700 = ~You and me both.~
@39701 = ~You should never have doubted I would find a way to freedom. I never did.~
@39702 = ~I wanted to visit you in jail, but they wouldn't even let me through the door. I thought you were done for.~ [BD39702]
@39703 = ~I'm so sorry, <CHARNAME>. I should never have let you go to Dragonspear without me.~ [BD39703]
@39704 = ~I missed you too. More than you know.~
@39705 = ~I'm glad you weren't there, Imoen. Some of the things I saw will haunt me the rest of my days.~
@39706 = ~You make it sound as though you could stop me.~
@39707 = ~But if I'd been there, maybe, I don't know—maybe things would've been different.~ [BD39707]
@39708 = ~Well, we're together again now, and that's the way it's going to stay. I'm not letting you out of my sight ever again. Come on, let's get a move on. It's only a matter of time before the Flaming Fist figures out where you are.~ [BD39708]
@39709 = ~We should get moving. It's only a matter of time before the Flaming Fist figures out where you are.~
@39710 = ~Boy, <CHARNAME>! Do you have to take every little thing as a personal affront? Come on, let's get a move on. It's only a matter of time before the Flaming Fist figures out where you are.~ [BD39710]
@39711 = ~Rejoice, Boo! Our friends have returned to us!~ [BD39711]
@39712 = ~But people have said one of our friends has been up to no good...~ [BD39712]
@39713 = ~I never thought I'd see thee again, <CHARNAME>. Knowing what I know, I would have preferred it that way. Thou art lucky to have a supporter as passionate as Imoen.~ [BD39713]
@39714 = ~Were it not for her, neither I nor Minsc would deign to look upon thee, never mind assist thee in escaping justice.~ [BD39714]
@39715 = ~So Imoen's hireling told it true. You have escaped the Fist and Silvershield's justice—for the moment. I promised Gorion to watch over and protect you. Your actions make me question that promise. ~
@39716 = ~Do not th-think I'm pleased to be here, <CHARNAME>. What I do, I do for Gorion and Imoen. If you did indeed murder Skie Silvershield, you will answer for it.~ [BD39716]
@39717 = ~Could we maybe talk about this someplace, you know—far away from here?~ [BD39717]
@39718 = ~Before we do that, I need to thank you, all of you, for, if not believing in me, at least supporting me in my hour of need. Especially you, Imoen. If you hadn't arranged my escape, I'd still be languishing in that cell.~
@39719 = ~Before we do that, I need to thank both of you for believing in me. Especially you, Imoen. If you hadn't arranged my escape, I'd still be languishing in that cell.~
@39720 = ~You go to all the effort to have me sprung me from the Fist's headquarters, and you don't include transportation in the plan? Bad form, Imoen. Bad form.~
@39721 = ~Agreed. Let's waste no more time in this place.~
@39722 = ~You think I got you out? ~
@39723 = ~You didn't?~
@39724 = ~The man who freed me said as much.~
@39725 = ~That is what I was told.~
@39726 = ~You think I got you out? No, no, no. A message came to the Ducal Palace, telling me where and when to meet you. I thought it was some scheme of yours.~ [BD39726]
@39727 = ~Most strange. And not a little disturbing.~
@39728 = ~I WISH I had such foresight.~
@39729 = ~Someone is manipulating me. When I find out who, they'll regret it.~

@39731 = ~You should not make light of the effort Imoen has made on your behalf.~
@39732 = ~Wait. Wait, wait, wait.~ [BD39732]
@39733 = ~Imoen? 'Twas thou who contrived to free our friend?~ [BD39733]
@39734 = ~You cannot believe everything you hear. Isn't that right, Boo?~
@39735 = ~Someone told you I was behind your breakout?~
@39736 = ~Less disturbing than being caught and imprisoned once again though, no?~ [BD39736]
@39737 = ~We can figure this out later. For now, we need to just keep moving. Forward!~ [BD39737]
@39738 = ~There are worse things you could be tricked into than escaping a cell, Minsc thinks.~ [BD39738]
@39739 = ~Someone is playing games with us.~
@39740 = ~B-b-but who?~ [BD39740]
@39741 = ~Heya, everyone! I got 'em!~ [BD39741]
@39742 = ~Rejoice, Boo! Our friends have returned to us!~ [BD39742]
@39743 = ~But one of our friends has been very, very naughty...~ [BD39743]
@39744 = ~I never thought I'd see thee again, <CHARNAME>. Knowing what I know, I would have preferred it that way. Thou art lucky to have a supporter as passionate as Imoen.~ [BD39744]
@39745 = ~Were it not for her, neither I nor Minsc would deign to look upon thee, never mind assist thee in escaping justice.~ [BD39745]
@39746 = ~So Imoen's hireling told it true. You have escaped the Fist and Silvershield's justice, <CHARNAME>—for the moment. I promised to watch over and protect you. Your actions make me regret that promise.~
@39747 = ~D-do not think I'm pleased to be here, <CHARNAME>. What I do, I do for Gorion and Imoen. If you did indeed murder Skie Silvershield, you will answer for it.~ [BD39747]
@39748 = ~Can we talk about this somewhere, you know, far away from here? Please?~ [BD39748]
@39749 = ~Before we go, I must speak. I have done terrible things in my time, I'll not deny it. Killing Skie Silvershield is not one of them. Whether you believe that or not, I thank you all for being here. Especially you, Imoen.~
@39750 = ~Before we go, I must speak. I have done terrible things in my time, I'll not deny it. Killing Skie Silvershield is not one of them. Whether you believe that or not, I thank you both for being here. Especially you, Imoen.~
@39751 = ~We don't have time to waste. Imoen, when you plotted my escape, did you arrange for transportation?~
@39752 = ~You can believe what you will. You have abetted my escape. The Fist won't look kindly on that.~
@39753 = ~Me? Why me?~ [BD39753]
@39754 = ~For arranging my escape, of course.~
@39755 = ~You nearly died because of me. Yet you remain steadfast in supporting me, organizing my escape from the Fist. I don't deserve to have you in my life, but I'm grateful you are.~
@39756 = ~You sent my liberator to see me free, did you not?~
@39757 = ~Imoen? 'Twas thou who contrived to free our friend?~ [BD39757]
@39758 = ~No. A message came to the Ducal Palace, telling me where and when to meet you. I figured it was some scheme of yours.~ [BD39758]
@39759 = ~Strange. And more than a little disturbing.~
@39760 = ~I WISH I had such foresight.~
@39761 = ~Who sent you this message?~
@39762 = ~I am being manipulated. When I learn who's behind this, they'll regret it.~
@39763 = ~Wait, you think I set up your breakout?~ [BD39763]
@39764 = ~We've not aided you yet. We would none of us be here were it not for Imoen's pleas.~
@39765 = ~I don't want them to help because they have to. I want them to help because they want to.~ [BD39765]
@39766 = ~That is too much to ask from those who see what they think they've seen. In time, I will prove my innocence. For now, we must away from here.~
@39767 = ~I'll take their help however I can get it. Did you arrange for transportation when you planned my escape?~
@39768 = ~I've neither the time nor the inclination to make my case here. They will see their error eventually.~
@39769 = ~A band of outlaws, on the run! Find Minsc a rich man to rob, that I may feed the poor!~ [BD39769]
@39770 = ~Perhaps we will—IF an error we have indeed made. Which I doubt.~
@39771 = ~All right. Let's get going.~ [BD39771]
@39772 = ~Imoen? You didn't mention you were involved in the escape. I d-d-don't know how I feel about this.~ [BD39772]
@39773 = ~I know how I feel about it. Were it not for Gorion, I'd let Silvershield have you.~
@39774 = ~We can figure this out later. The Fist will come looking for us soon. We should get out of here before they do.~ [BD39774]
@39775 = ~If thou didst, thou might have foreseen thy imprisonment and elected not to slaughter an innocent girl.~ [BD39775]
@39776 = ~Someone is playing games with us.~
@39777 = ~B-but who?~ [BD39777]
@39778 = ~I thought you did. Who else would know what you were planning? This WAS your plan, right?~ [BD39778]
@39779 = ~I'm pretty sure the Flaming Fist isn't on our trail. Can we take a break, just for a minute?~ [BD39779]
@39780 = ~I th-th-think we could all use a... a rest.~ [BD39780]
@39781 = ~We've escaped for the moment, but we cannot run forever. How do you plan to answer the charges against you, <CHARNAME>? Your flight will do little to win you favor with the citizens of Baldur's Gate.~
@39782 = ~Entar Silvershield has a l-long reach. It would be nice if we had some sort of, of, of p-p-plan to stay out of his grasp.~ [BD39782]
@39783 = ~Thou hast thy freedom. What wouldst thou have us do now?~ [BD39783]
@39784 = ~Oh, it's nights like this that make Minsc think of the day that came before them. What a day it was, eh, Boo? Ha!~ [BD39784]
@39785 = ~I'm glad we're back together, <CHARNAME>. I was afraid I'd lost you.~ [BD39785]
@39786 = ~Hey, do you feel a little... off?~ [BD39786]
@39787 = ~Now. ~
@39788 = ~Come to Minsc, shadowy men! And bring your shadowy butts, that I may kick them!~ [BD39788]
@39789 = ~What is this I feel...? Head is light—lighter than usual, even...~ [BD39789]
@39790 = ~All goes dark... Run, Boo... Run...~ [BD39790]
@39791 = ~The mist—it is more than mist. It dulls the senses...~ [BD39791]
@39792 = ~They are shadows... Can't see them properly...~ [BD39792]
@39793 = ~The world fades...~ [BD39793]
@39794 = ~Dynaheir! I will save you!~ [BD39794]
@39795 = ~Watch your backs! We have enemies on all sides!~
@39796 = ~I may fall this n-night, but I'll d-drag a few of you down with me!~
@39797 = ~Jaheira, my love! I will be with you, always!~
@39798 = ~Khalid, no! Please, I cannot lose you, not again...~
@39799 = ~Back! Back, you flapping vultures, get away from me!~
@39800 = ~I— What is this? What have you done to us?~
@39801 = ~Is this how it ends, then...?~
@39802 = ~JAHEIRA! My love! Be strong, I am with you!~
@39803 = ~C'mon, then. Show us what you've got.~
@39804 = ~What's going on? Fingers're tingly.~
@39805 = ~Ow. That's gotta hurt. Why doesn't that hurt?~
@39806 = ~Aw, hells. This is no good.~
@39807 = ~Does the child of Bhaal still live?~ [BD39807]
@39808 = ~They all do. For the moment.~ [BD39808]
@39809 = ~Load them onto the cart, quickly. I want us on the road south in no more than five minutes. Our client is anxious to have his prize.~ [BD39809]
@39810 = ~Our client is anxious to have his prize.~
@39811 = ~Justice for Silvershield! Death to the traitor!~
@39812 = ~Thrix is glad to hear it, though you should have let Thrix finish telling you the terms before agreeing. For if you lose the bet, Thrix the Profane will take your soul!~
@39813 = ~I am glad you think so, my friend. But I must admit I have misgivings over playing this devil's game at all...~ [BD39813]
@39814 = ~You won't part with the monk, eh? All right, then, who else is there for Thrix to take?~
@39815 = ~Your commitment to your friends is admirable, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD39815]
@39816 = ~A pity. Thrix thinks she would have made a worthy addition to his coterie. Who else is there? Let Thrix see...~
@39817 = ~You are wise to hold the mystic might of Odesseiron in such esteem. And you, devil—you would eat me? Thay's greatest son Edwin Odesseiron is too spicy a dish, even for you. Can a devil choke unto death? Try me and find out.~ [BD39817]
@39818 = ~Ah! Such sweet and savory arrogance. Thrix is tempted to simply take the Red Wizard and have done with it. But that would go against the spirit of the game. Who shall Thrix choose, then?~
@39819 = ~When it's time, Maglubiyet gets me, not you. But it's not time yet.~ [BD39819]
@39820 = ~Oh, she is a sharp one, Thrix likes her. But you have made your feelings clear, <CHARNAME>. Thrix shall abide by your decision.~
@39821 = ~Looks like I'll get to smile a little longer, demon.~ [BD39821]
@39822 = ~Does Thrix call you a dwarf, gnome? No? Then call Thrix a devil, for that is what he is. Now. Who shall Thrix take...?~
@39823 = ~Yes. Most amusing.~ [BD39823]
@39824 = ~Just as well, I suppose. The last thing Thrix needs is trouble with Ur-Gothoz. Who shall join Thrix the Profane if <CHARNAME> loses the wager?~
@39825 = ~Ugh. UGH. UUUUUUUUGH. Just keep your paws off of me.~
@39826 = ~Thrix thinks you would have found the flames of Avernus too familiar to truly enjoy anyway. But if not you, then who?~
@39827 = ~I am no one's prize, be they devil or man. Count yourself lucky I've not been made part of this—both of you.~ [BD39827]
@39828 = ~The drow is too tart, even for Thrix's taste. He's better off with another.~
@39829 = ~Ho ho! You are a lucky devil. Voghiln is an old hand at gambling—he would teach you a thing or two. Well, maybe not two. A thing and a half, say.~ [BD39829]
@39830 = ~Thrix would teach you something, you corpulent braggart! Ahhh, forget the skald, he's not worth it. But who, then?~
@39831 = ~What game is it you play now, <CHARNAME>? Whose soul will you wager, if not these?~
@39832 = ~I can speak for just one soul in good conscience, and that is my own.~
@39833 = ~No souls, fiend. The winner's prize shall be life, the loser's, utter destruction. And the determination will be made in combat!~
@39834 = ~Hah! You think Thrix the Profane would sully his claws with your blood? No, <CHARNAME>, we shall not fight this day. Not when Thrix's fellow fiends can fight for him. And by the time you're through with them, Thrix's master should be finished with the Shining Lady.~ [BD39834]
@39835 = ~And by the time you're through with them, Thrix's master should be finished with the Shining Lady.~
@39836 = ~An alliterator? Thrix thanks you, <CHARNAME>. You have saved the Profane One a good deal of irritation.~
@39837 = ~FIRST, Tiax will kill all those who dare look down upon him.~
@39838 = ~THEN he will have all who question slaughtering the tall put to the death.~
@39839 = ~The families of those who question him must also be taught a lesson. Their firstborns will be sacrificed to Cyric! ~
@39840 = ~Whoever's left will happily accept Tiax's rule! Or ELSE... ~
@39841 = ~Well met. What can Tiax do for you this fine <DAYNIGHTALL>?~
@39842 = ~Are you all right?~
@39843 = ~I would have you join me on a great adventure, Tiax. Cyric has promised glory to all who fight at my side.~
@39844 = ~There is naught you can do for me, or anyone, inside this dungeon.~
@39845 = ~Is Tiax all right? Tiax is more than all right! Tiax is mighty! All will bow before the wonder and glory of Tiax when Tiax rules!~
@39846 = ~Cyric said this to you? You dare go over Tiax's head? Tiax will grind your bones to paste, you gaping mackerel!~
@39847 = ~DIE! DIE IN TIAX'S NAME!~
@39848 = ~You are lucky Tiax chooses to await his destiny in this cell. But your luck will run out when he rules. Tremble in terror—the day is coming!~
@39849 = ~Now begone. Tiax would have a nap.~
@39850 = ~You see a dungeon? Are you mad? This is no dungeon, it is the beating heart of all Toril. And Tiax is in that heart, bathing in the blood of all who live!~
@39851 = ~HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!~
@39852 = ~Yes, friend? Can I be of service?~ [BD39852]
@39853 = ~I fear not, unless you've changed your mind on joining me.~
@39854 = ~You COULD be, if you were to face Caelar at my side.~
@39855 = ~Perhaps. You've spent some time in the company of those who've fled Caelar's crusade. What have you learned of her?~
@39856 = ~To someone, I'm sure. But not to me.~
@39857 = ~I am sorry. I am needed here now. I cannot leave.~ [BD39857]
@39858 = ~Ask me anything but that, and I will do what I can to help you.~ [BD39858]
@39859 = ~I'm sorry you won't be joining me, but you must do what honor demands, of course.~
@39860 = ~Have the refugees told you anything of Caelar?~
@39861 = ~If you will not do that, you can do nothing for me.~
@39862 = ~Precious little, I'm afraid. What I've heard is secondhand at best.~ [BD39862]
@39863 = ~Her followers seem to fall into two broad categories—mercenaries of various races hired to do her bidding, and those she has recruited to her cause. There is some dispute over which is more fearful.~ [BD39863]
@39864 = ~Of the woman herself, most know of her through her followers' actions. Few have seen her personally. Those who do tend to side with her afterwards.~ [BD39864]
@39865 = ~She is, by all accounts, a powerful personality, with a charisma that overwhelms her enemies as much as any sword she wields. Families have been torn apart because of her, brother turned against brother. A dire situation.~ [BD39865]
@39866 = ~Thank you, Rasaad. You've been very helpful.~
@39867 = ~Dire indeed. And I'm right in the middle of it—again.~
@39868 = ~The situation is well in hand. Caelar's threat will be dealt with in short order.~
@39869 = ~I am glad you understand. Now if you will excuse me, I have matters I must attend to. May Selûne smile upon you. Farewell.~ [BD39869]
@39870 = ~Please excuse me, then. I have matters I must attend to.~ [BD39870]
@39871 = ~It is your destiny to do great things. You can embrace it or no, but fate will not be denied. Please excuse me now. There are matters I must attend to. May you find favor in Selûne's eyes.~ [BD39871]
@39872 = ~More wine? I'll not have any more myself, but you're decent enough company, for the most part.~ [BD39872]
@39873 = ~For the most part?~
@39874 = ~Tempting, but no. I've too much to do before we head out.~
@39875 = ~I've had more than enough for the night.~
@39876 = ~Take it as a compliment.~ [BD39876]
@39877 = ~You are a woman of refinement and taste.~
@39878 = ~Is that how it was intended?~
@39879 = ~I don't think I will. I know a compliment when I hear one.~
@39880 = ~You noticed. Good eye.~ [BD39880]
@39881 = ~I'm noticing a lot of things about you.~
@39882 = ~I've two eyes, actually, and they're better than good. I've been told they're spectacular.~
@39883 = ~You seem pretty observant yourself. Tell me what you make of me.~
@39884 = ~Don't look too hard. You might not like what you see.~ [BD39884]
@39885 = ~Let me know when you want to leave, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD39885]
@39886 = ~Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies. I'll follow you out when you leave.~ [BD39886]
@39887 = ~As you wish. I'll follow you out when you leave.~ [BD39887]
@39888 = ~And how much had the person who told you that had to drink?~ [BD39888]
@39889 = ~Just joking. They're pretty good eyes, I'll give you that. Finish up what you need to do here and I'll follow you out when you leave.~ [BD39889]
@39890 = ~Take it however you want then, but I should warn you, if you think that was insulting, our time together's going to be... uncomfortable.~ [BD39890]
@39891 = ~I think I'll keep that to myself—for the moment. I'll be by the door. I'll follow you out when you go.~ [BD39891]
@39892 = ~And that is that. Get some sleep. I'd do the same if I were able. If you need anything, I'll probably be around here organizing the caravan till the morning.~
@39893 = ~What's this?~
@39894 = ~This monk says he belongs to you, <CHARNAME>?~
@39895 = ~Rasaad? What are you doing here?~
@39896 = ~Rasaad! Tell me you've changed your mind and come to join me.~
@39897 = ~What do you want, monk?~
@39898 = ~It is good to see a friendly face in the wilderness. I come to join you on your quest, <CHARNAME>—if you will still have me.~ [BD39898]
@39899 = ~I would welcome the assistance, Rasaad. You know that. But why the change of heart?~
@39900 = ~What brings you this way? You seemed determined to remain in Baldur's Gate.~
@39901 = ~You had your chance, monk. Begone.~
@39902 = ~I took some time to reflect on what really matters in this world. Helping the needy is a worthy ambition, but Baldur's Gate is not where I should be right now.~ [BD39902]
@39903 = ~I smell a story there. What's going on, Rasaad?~
@39904 = ~I don't need your help at the moment, but I might later. Wait in camp for me and I'll call on you when I need you.~
@39905 = ~And where should you be, then?~
@39906 = ~Would that I could tell you, my friend. I am grasping at shadows, perhaps real, perhaps imagined. I will not drag you into my darkness, not until I know the truth. When my path is clear, you will be the first to know. Until then...~ [BD39906]
@39907 = ~Come, join me. ~
@39908 = ~I took some time to reflect on what was really important. My sect is doing valuable work in Baldur's Gate, but it is not where I should be right now.~ [BD39908]
@39909 = ~I would join you—if you'll have me.~ [BD39909]
@39910 = ~Yes, I require your aid. Join me.~
@39911 = ~I don't need help at the moment, but things change. Wait for me in the Flaming Fist camp east of here.~
@39912 = ~You made your choice back in the Gate, monk. Begone.~
@39913 = ~When I am ready. Aye.~
@39914 = ~If that is your wish, my friend. May Selûne smile upon you.~ [BD39914]
@39915 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I have always treasured your support, and your wisdom. I fear I may need both before long.~ [BD39915]
@39916 = ~If it is wisdom you need, Boo is there for you. He is a gifted counselor of the bold and the bald.~ [BD39916]
@39917 = ~Come one, come all! Come catch a glimpse of the cream of the Sword Coast's combatant crop! Witness the brilliant and the bizarre battle in the Black Pits of the one and only Baeloth the Entertainer!~
@39918 = ~Gather in the gallery, my gallants! 'Tis time for another test 'twixt two titanic terrors in Baeloth's blackest pit yet!~
@39919 = ~Yayyyy...~
@39920 = ~Fate favors you fortunate few who will witness these feral foes in a furious fray! First, I give you the wild wonder of the western kingdoms. Wise men say only fools rush in to face... the wolverine!~
@39921 = ~That's a wolverine? Looks like a rat...~
@39922 = ~But what could win in war against the wild wolverine? There's but one answer: that hardy, hate-filled horror, the honey badger!~
@39923 = ~Now that is DEFINITELY a squirrel.~
@39924 = ~I bid the battle... BEGIN!~
@39925 = ~Booo...~
@39926 = ~You call this entertainment? Coz I don't.~
@39927 = ~Me mum and dad've 'ad better fights than this over Midwinter dinner!~
@39928 = ~Where's the blood? Where's the furious beauty of the battle? Where's the eternal dance of life and death, the dramatic clash of tooth an' claw in an unendin' battle for survival and supremacy, played out before us in the theater of battle?~
@39929 = ~Yeah! Where is that stuff?~
@39930 = ~Patience, my peculiarly profound patrons! The primitive play you propose will be presented!~ [BD39930]
@39931 = ~Gods, Baeloth! What are you up to now?~
@39932 = ~This display is as disgusting as it is disturbing. And it's over now.~
@39933 = ~Your audience is right, drow. This is about as entertaining as watching grass grow.~
@39934 = ~Present it soon or I'll give these people the show they desire.~
@39935 = ~You crave more, you cretinous creatures—er, cultured company of canniness and class? I concur. And so I give you... the goblin!~ [BD39935]
@39936 = ~And so I give you... the goblin!~
@39937 = ~I prithee patience, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I promise a powerful performance of unparalleled passion! And so I give you... the goblin!~
@39938 = ~Your words wound worse than any weapon. If you've no appreciation for what I provide, I'll not waste time worrying about your wailing.~
@39939 = ~I'm with <PRO_HIMHER>—come on, everyone. Let's go do something more fun. Like sleeping or repeatedly bashing our heads against a tree.~
@39940 = ~Do I know you?~ [BD39940]
@39941 = ~You don't remember? It wasn't so long ago we fought together, each at the other's side.~
@39942 = ~We've not met. I'd remember you.~
@39943 = ~You should. I'm pretty sure I killed you once.~
@39944 = ~Ah, yes. <CHARNAME>. It's... moderately mortifying to see you again. But the past is past, and these people pine for a performance. And so I give you... the goblin!~ [BD39944]
@39945 = ~You flatter me.~ [BD39945]
@39946 = ~I'm gonna FLATTEN you if this show doesn't improve.~
@39947 = ~Let me out of here, drow! Let me out!~ [BD39947]
@39948 = ~You'll have your freedom, my freakish friend—but first, you must fight for it!~ [BD39948]
@39949 = ~Kill it! Kill the goblin, y'bloody rat!~
@39950 = ~I thought it was a wolverine...~
@39951 = ~Shut up!~

@39953 = ~Silence, you simpering scullion!~ [BD39953]
@39954 = ~Wait—am I to understand this goblin doesn't want to fight?~
@39955 = ~The goblin clearly doesn't want to be here. Release her. Now.~
@39956 = ~A goblin against a drow—there's a fight worth watching. Do it, goblin! Fight! Fight!~
@39957 = ~Think on this a tick, noble one. Have you ever met a goblin that DIDN'T thirst for the thrill of the fray?~ [BD39957]
@39958 = ~Free me, snake!~ [BD39958]
@39959 = ~Shut your slobbering facehole, you sniveling smutch!~

@39963 = ~What she wants—? Worthless! ~
@39964 = ~Not to me.~

@39966 = ~I'll be the judge of that. ~
@39967 = ~It's over, drow. Free these wretches, or you'll answer to the Flaming Fist.~
@39968 = ~Or me!~
@39969 = ~What?~
@39970 = ~I'd not see this goblin suffer, and I doubt you'll let her go without payment. So tell me, what price her freedom?~
@39971 = ~I'm trying to get you out of here.~

@39975 = ~Think on this, drow!~
@39976 = ~Recognize your role, you repellent wretch. I am the Entertainer. I speak. You watch and applaud—or remove yourself, if you'd rather.~ [BD39976]
@39977 = ~That does it. This place is finished.~
@39978 = ~I'll not let you kill a sentient creature for the entertainment of this mob.~
@39979 = ~I'll remove your head, you alliterating annoyance!~
@39980 = ~You can't just come into my camp and close it down.~
@39981 = ~We'll do worse than that if you don't end this foolishness.~
@39982 = ~I cannot concede to such contemptible, nay, criminal, coercion.~ [BD39982]

@39984 = ~You would adjudge me? Absurd!~
@39985 = ~Gah! Stop! I surrender! Cease this spectral assault! I GIVE UP!~ [BD39985]
@39986 = ~My pit of plenty... pauperized, made pitiful by a pernicious porcupine of a goblin! What a woeful waste.~ [BD39986]
@39987 = ~It was pitiful long before the goblin did what she did.~
@39988 = ~Not that woeful. It really wasn't much of an arena to begin with.~
@39989 = ~The goblin's more merciful than I would be in her shoes.~
@39990 = ~You're right, <PRO_RACE>. 'Twas a shoddy sham of a show, so short of Baeloth the Entertainer's solid gold standards I'm shamed to say it. ~
@39991 = ~To the south there is a Flaming Fist camp. Go there, and tell them <CHARNAME> sent you. They're accustomed to duergar and drow, they shouldn't give you too much trouble.~
@39992 = ~Bide here a time. If I've need of a showman, I shall return for you.~
@39993 = ~<CHARNAME>, no, no. You can't trust this... THIS.~ [BD39993]
@39994 = ~Boo has no problems with most drow. But THIS drow is another story—one that Boo says will not end well!~ [BD39994]

@39996 = ~I suppose.~
@39997 = ~If it's the thrill of battle you want, you should join us. You'd see plenty in our company, I'm sure.~

@40004 = ~M'Khiin's my name, of the Grubdoubler clan.~ [BD40004]
@40005 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry you had to suffer the drow's hospitality. Such as it was.~

@40007 = ~Been through worse. It's over now.~ [BD40007]

@40011 = ~Caelar. The spirits say her soul was pure once. Then it... twisted into somethin' else. Yes. I'll come with you.~ [BD40011]
@40012 = ~Yes. I will come with you.~ [BD40012]
@40013 = ~Can't. Not with the snaketongue drow around.~ [BD40013]

@40016 = ~Shut up, Baeloth. This goblin is worth ten of you. Begone.~
@40017 = ~And yet she's preferable company to you.~
@40018 = ~Best move along, goblin. I don't want further trouble.~
@40019 = ~You abandon our alliance after mere moments, on this awkward anklebiter's account? ~
@40020 = ~I do.~
@40021 = ~That, and your awful alliteration aggressively aggravates.~
@40022 = ~If I follow what you just said—and I'm not entirely sure I do—then yes. Get out of here.~
@40023 = ~We've had some good times together, drow, but what can I say? She makes me laugh.~

@40025 = ~You'll regret renouncing this relationship.~ [BD40025]
@40026 = ~I don't think I will. Now leave me.~
@40027 = ~I already do. Sorry, M'Khiin. You'll have to make do on your own.~
@40028 = ~I'm used to it. ~
@40029 = ~Bah! Baeloth Barrityl's bound to do better without your bevy of brutes.~ [BD40029]
@40030 = ~M'Khiin. Now will you join me?~
@40031 = ~Good riddance to bad rubbish. Best you be on your way as well, goblin.~
@40032 = ~Gladly.~ [BD40032]
@40033 = ~I shall attend this camp for a time. So long as it amuses me.~ [BD40033]

@40037 = ~You're lucky, <PRO_RACE>. I'm a goblin; doesn't matter what I want. Trouble finds me.~ [BD40037]

@40045 = ~I do believe you're right. Begone, drow.~
@40046 = ~I'm sure he'd say the same about you. Drow, goblins, you're none of you well-loved 'round here. But I need all the help I can get, and you both show promise.~
@40047 = ~I trust him to do what he must to stay alive—for those in my company, that means showing me unwavering loyalty.~
@40048 = ~The show is my soul, <CHARNAME>. Baeloth is yours to command. ~
@40049 = ~Good. You'll have no issue working with M'Khiin, then?~
@40050 = ~M'Khiin, can you accept this arrangement?~
@40051 = ~None whatsoever.~
@40052 = ~If he can do it, I certainly can.~
@40053 = ~I want to leave HIM behind. Can't trust him. Can't trust me WITH him.~
@40054 = ~I understand. Sorry, Baeloth. I'm afraid this is where we part ways.~

@40056 = ~Oooh, I smell magic.~ [BD40056]

@40071 = ~As you wish.~
@40072 = ~I was trying to be friendly and you go and tell me to push off. Look at me. Do you really think that's going to end well for you?~
@40073 = ~If you don't know, you don't need to know.~
@40074 = ~ 'Tis Master Vichand's workspace. And he doesn't like people hanging 'round it. Neither do I, come to that.~
@40075 = ~I'll push off, you monkey-faced worm!~
@40076 = ~Blessed be in the light.~
@40077 = ~Not for you. Get <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@40078 = ~Get <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@40079 = ~YES, WE HAVE THE POTION; I HEARD YOU. Sorry, <CHARNAME>. Now we've just got to find the rest of the ingredients. ~
@40080 = ~Belladonna's poisonous, <CHARNAME>. Be careful with it. Glad we've got it though. One more item down. ~
@40081 = ~Glad we've got it though. One more item down. ~

@40084 = ~Adoy?~
@40085 = ~What are you raving incoherently about now?~
@40086 = ~That depends on how you define "all right"—oh wait, no, it doesn't, and I'm not all right. I'm not all right at all!~ [BD40086]
@40087 = ~I can't take it anymore, <CHARNAME>. If I go one more day with Adoy buzzing around in my head, I'm going to, to—I don't know what I'm going to do, but it won't be good!~
@40088 = ~I can't take it anymore, <CHARNAME>! If I go one more day with Adoy buzzing around in my head, I'm gonna d—I don't know what I'm gonna do, but it won't be good! I need him out—now!~ [BD40088]
@40089 = ~What can we do? We don't have all the ingredients you need for your potion.~
@40090 = ~Can you make the potion with the elements you've got?~
@40091 = ~I could knock you out. That would stop him talking in your head and you talking in my vicinity.~
@40092 = ~I don't care. Next time we rest, I'm making the potion with what I do have. I've got to do SOMETHING.~ [BD40092]
@40093 = ~That's a big risk, Neera. Only you can decide if it's worth taking. Whatever your choice, you know I'll be here to support you.~
@40094 = ~You'd drink an improvised potion made by a wild mage? Well, it's your body, I suppose...~
@40095 = ~You're mad, and any potion you concoct will only make you more mad—especially one you know you can't make correctly.~
@40096 = ~That's just it—it WON'T stop him talking. Even when I'm asleep or unconscious, he's still there, nattering away! YES, I SAID NATTERING. BECAUSE YOU NATTER. YOU ARE A NATTERER.~ [BD40096]
@40097 = ~YES, I SAID NATTERING. BECAUSE YOU NATTER. YOU ARE A NATTERER.~

@40102 = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>. I can always count on you to be there for me.~
@40103 = ~It's risky, but it's a risk I'm ready to take.~ [BD40103]
@40104 = ~The choice is yours, Neera. You know I'll support you whatever you do.~
@40105 = ~It's your body and your mind. I won't stand in your way.~
@40106 = ~You court madness, or worse. Are you sure you want to do this?~
@40107 = ~You think I'm mad now? Give me a couple more days with Lord Won'tshutup in my mind and THEN you'll see madness.~
@40108 = ~I'm making the potion next time we take a break. Don't try to stop me.~
@40109 = ~You don't get it, <CHARNAME>. If you're lucky, you'll never have to get it.~
@40110 = ~I am so very, very ready for this to be over already. Go to sleep, <CHARNAME>. This potion's gonna take a while.~ [BD40110]
@40111 = ~Are you sure you want to do this, Neera? We might be able to find some more of the ingredients for the potion...~
@40112 = ~Making this potion now—it's a bad idea. Can't you hold on just a little longer?~
@40113 = ~You're determined to do this, aren't you? You're a fool—but fools can be amusing. Go ahead, I'll not stop you.~
@40114 = ~It's happening now—YES, IT IS. YOU CAN'T STOP ME.~ [BD40114]
@40115 = ~You see? You see? I can't put up with that anymore! I can't. I won't. Go to sleep. We'll talk about this again in a few hours.~ [BD40115]
@40116 = ~Even if the potion kills me, it can't be worse than having Adoy buzzing in my head. THAT'S RIGHT, I'D RATHER DIE THAN LISTEN TO YOU—I don't CARE about your feelings!~ [BD40116]
@40117 = ~Well, thanks for the support. Now go to sleep; I've got work to do.~ [BD40117]
@40118 = ~Mmph... ree... mmph.~
@40119 = ~Hello? Is someone in there?~
@40120 = ~Is it just me, or is that plant talking?~
@40121 = ~Explain yourself.~
@40122 = ~I hear it as well. These vines are not natural.~
@40123 = ~Someone's stuck under all these vines.~ [BD40123]
@40124 = ~...ree us... mmph... ~
@40125 = ~"Free us"? Is that what you're saying?~
@40126 = ~Caught in a vine snare, I see. I'm not surprised. You really have to watch your step in these woods. Danger everywhere.~
@40127 = ~You might be an innocent victim ensnared by a trap, or someone might have put you here for good reason.~
@40128 = ~That's what I'd be saying.~ [BD40128]
@40129 = ~Let's get them out of there.~ [BD40129]
@40130 = ~We have more important things to do than rescue those bested by plants.~ [BD40130]
@40131 = ~The drow is right. These creatures' fates mean nothing. Let's move on.~
@40132 = ~Help... mmmph... dying! Cut free... or dispel!~
@40133 = ~Hold still. I'll see if I can help.~
@40134 = ~All right, all right. I'll take care of the big, bad, tangly vines.~
@40135 = ~Cease your mewling. I'll release you.~
@40136 = ~I don't trust you. You'd better stay put for the time being.~
@40137 = ~MMMMPH! ~
@40138 = ~You've returned once more to our circle. ~
@40139 = ~How does it fare?~

@40145 = ~I'm still working on the dark druid problem. I'll return when I have news.~
@40146 = ~Good luck fighting the evil tree, then.~
@40147 = ~Tell me again what it is you want me to do.~
@40148 = ~I must take my leave.~
@40149 = ~The cavern entrance lies to the northeast. A cave marks the way in the face of a great cliff. Beyond you'll find Ferrusk and his corrupt circle.~
@40150 = ~Tell me again what it is you want me to do.~
@40151 = ~Thank you. I'll return when I have news.~
@40152 = ~Thanks. Good luck with the evil tree situation.~
@40153 = ~I must take my leave.~
@40154 = ~You must find the dark druids' circle and plant the enchanted seed at the roots of the tree there. ~
@40155 = ~I remember. I'll return when I have news.~
@40156 = ~Magic seed. Evil tree roots. I'm on it.~
@40157 = ~I've thought it over, and I'll track down these dark druids for you. Give me the enchanted seed.~
@40158 = ~Where can I find the dark druids?~
@40159 = ~I must take my leave.~
@40160 = ~The forest thanks you. Here's the enchanted seed. Once it touches the tree's roots, its magic will awaken... and Ferrusk will pay.~
@40161 = ~Travel safely.~
@40162 = ~Greetings, <CHARNAME>. The forest told me of your approach. ~
@40163 = ~Greetings once again, Jamven.~
@40164 = ~I wish I had a tree-based alarm system. That'd be handy when I'm camping.~
@40165 = ~Oh? And what else did the trees say?~
@40166 = ~We saw the corrupt luminescence fade from the tree's branches and knew you had succeeded. You have our gratitude.~
@40167 = ~It wasn't an easy fight, but we triumphed.~
@40168 = ~Your gratitude and a gold piece will buy me some ale.~
@40169 = ~The dark druid offended me. I felled him for my own reasons, not to please you.~
@40170 = ~The forest tells me much. It also whispers that you betrayed our trust. You sided with Ferrusk! ~
@40171 = ~He made a convincing argument to spare his life... and to take yours.~
@40172 = ~I decided not to get involved. I'm staying out of your druid war.~
@40173 = ~Maybe the trees are lying, ever think of that? They never liked me much.~
@40174 = ~You've been misled. I killed Ferrusk and purified the tree. Give it time.~
@40175 = ~Don't try to deceive me. You failed in your mission. ~
@40176 = ~You're right. I've decided that you are the true threat here. ~
@40177 = ~I'm not lying. I did what you asked of me, and now you call me a betrayer. You're the one betraying me.~
@40178 = ~...Perhaps I was mistaken. The corruption in this place can... cloud one's thoughts. Please accept my apology.~
@40179 = ~I understand. Let's put this misunderstanding behind us.~
@40180 = ~I'm hurt by your accusations, but I suppose I can forgive them. Now let's talk about a reward.~
@40181 = ~Regardless of your motivations, your actions have benefited us and this forest. Please, take this as a symbol of our thanks. ~
@40182 = ~I'm glad I could help.~

@40187 = ~It'll do for now. ~
@40188 = ~I accept your reward and your thanks. Now I take my leave.~
@40189 = ~The only thing more pathetic than your failure is your lies. ~
@40190 = ~May your travels be swift.~
@40191 = ~You are a coward. We placed our trust in an unworthy agent, I see. Return the enchanted seed and begone from this place.~
@40192 = ~I don't think so. I could get a lot of money for this.~
@40193 = ~So you can destroy this living tree? No. It has as much a right to survive as any plant.~
@40194 = ~Very well. Here it is.~
@40195 = ~You would attack a peaceful circle? You are not the person I thought you were! ~
@40196 = ~We cannot slaughter innocent druids!~
@40197 = ~This does not sit well with me. Nature needed help, and you turned your back on her.~
@40198 = ~I didn't think thou the type to act so selfishly, <CHARNAME>. We could have helped the land.~
@40199 = ~You showed courage and character, <CHARNAME>. I am proud of you.~
@40200 = ~We did a good thing today, <CHARNAME>. The forest thanks you.~
@40201 = ~Keep the seed, then. See what good it does you when we take it off your lifeless body!~
@40202 = ~You show some wisdom. Too little wisdom. Too late. You abandoned this forest to a slow death. Yours shall be much quicker.~
@40203 = ~You abandoned this forest to a slow death. Yours shall be much quicker!~
@40204 = ~Welcome! What can I do for you today?~ [BD40204]
@40205 = ~You can tell me who you are, for a start.~

@40207 = ~Why are there so many crates stacked in here?~
@40208 = ~Do you have any work I might do?~
@40209 = ~Greetings to you as well. I can't talk now, but perhaps we'll meet again.~
@40210 = ~You can spare me any further questions. I've no time for idle chat.~
@40211 = ~A crusader I saved in the caverns told me to seek you out.~
@40212 = ~You can fill my purse up with gold for saving one of your crusader friends from death-by-fungus.~

@40214 = ~A man I helped promised you'd give me a reward for saving his life.~
@40215 = ~I moved that grain for you.~
@40216 = ~The sahuagin are gone. The way is clear.~
@40217 = ~I moved that grain AGAIN for you.~
@40218 = ~What was all that racket out there? ~
@40219 = ~It was nothing. Just a... a fight with a squirrel got a bit out of hand. ~
@40220 = ~What, again?! Gods help us...~
@40221 = ~Name's Ladle. I'm the lead supervisor for this depot. I organize, I direct. You can think of me as the heart of this operation. After Caelar, of course, glory be to She Who Shines and All Who Walk In Her Light.~ [BD40221]
@40222 = ~Quite impressive. How should I address you?~
@40223 = ~It's a wonder you're not commanding legions of troops by now. You could wrap up this whole crusade in a day or two.~
@40224 = ~Yes. Glory to Caelar. I am <CHARNAME>.~
@40225 = ~I'm glad to meet another who recognizes my value. And you hide your sarcasm so well too!~
@40226 = ~<CHARNAME>. Good to meet you. ~

@40228 = ~A pleasure to meet you, Ladle. I'm called <CHARNAME>.~
@40229 = ~You may address me as <CHARNAME>. Or my <PRO_LADYLORD>, if you prefer.~

@40233 = ~Why are there so many crates jammed in here?~
@40234 = ~Is there any work I might do for you?~
@40235 = ~Nothing for now, thanks. Perhaps we'll speak again.~
@40236 = ~Leave me be.~

@40239 = ~Why are there so many crates stacked in here?~
@40240 = ~I see. I had another question.~
@40241 = ~Yes, we store supplies and run them through the caverns as needed. Not a glamorous job, but very necessary. ~
@40242 = ~Why are there so many crates stacked in here?~
@40243 = ~I see. I had another question.~
@40244 = ~Fishfolk, that's why. Shoogen or however you call them.~ [BD40244]

@40246 = ~Shoogen? You mean sahuagin?~
@40247 = ~I have no idea what you're talking about. At all.~
@40248 = ~Explain, gnome.~
@40249 = ~I think he means sahuagin. Scaled humanoids who live in the water.~
@40250 = ~The gnome speaks of sahuagin, a vicious aquatic race. (Not as vicious as a Red Wizard surrounded by imbeciles, though!)~
@40251 = ~Nasty creatures with scaly hides and sharp teeth. Run at you with a spear as soon as they see you. They've taken over a cavern and blocked our path to the castle.~
@40252 = ~Perhaps I can speak with these creatures, try and negotiate passage for the supplies.~
@40253 = ~The number of creatures who run at me with drawn weapons is surprisingly high. Shall I deal with these ones for you?~
@40254 = ~A few fishmen stall your operation? Caelar will not be pleased. You need help, Ladle. I can kill these things for you—for a price.~
@40255 = ~They're a nuisance, but they're not interfering with operations too badly. I've faith the situation will resolve itself shortly. Until then, we'll make do.~
@40256 = ~As you wish. I had another question.~
@40257 = ~Your loss. I have more questions.~
@40258 = ~There's always work to be done. See that pile of crates? They're full of grain. Move them to those empty crates near the river.~
@40259 = ~Consider it done.~
@40260 = ~What sort of payment can I expect for this?~
@40261 = ~I'll not waste my time on so trivial a task.~
@40262 = ~We'll see when you get the job done. ~
@40263 = ~Fine, fine. I'm on it.~
@40264 = ~I have better things to do with my time.~
@40265 = ~Are we laborers now, that we should waste our time slinging sacks of grain about?~
@40266 = ~Ugh. This sounds way too much like honest work.~ [BD40266]
@40267 = ~You moved every single sack over there? Left none behind?~
@40268 = ~Every one. ~
@40269 = ~Not a single grain of... well, grain, has been left behind.~
@40270 = ~It is done.~
@40271 = ~You did a great job. Now I have another task for you. ~
@40272 = ~What do you need done?~
@40273 = ~Something easier on the back, if you don't mind.~
@40274 = ~What now?~
@40275 = ~You moved every single sack over there? Left none behind? Great. Now I've another task for you. This part's a bit more complicated, so listen carefully. What you need to do is to take all the grain you just moved, and move it back here.~
@40276 = ~Wait, what?~
@40277 = ~Move it BACK? I just spent forever moving it over there!~
@40278 = ~If this is some sort of ill-considered joke, I should tell you I've little patience for such "humor."~
@40279 = ~You heard me. Move it all back here. ~
@40280 = ~This is ridiculous. Why ask me to move the grain in the first place?~
@40281 = ~What is this, an initiation or something? It's not amusing.~
@40282 = ~I'll do no such thing.~
@40283 = ~You asked for work. You didn't ask for IMPORTANT work. So move it all back here or be on your way. ~
@40284 = ~I see I have to watch my words closely around you. I'll move the grain back to its proper place, but I won't be tricked again.~
@40285 = ~This is why I don't trust gnomes. "Never trust a gnome," that's what I always say.~
@40286 = ~I should strike you down where you stand for wasting my time.~
@40287 = ~Hey. I'm standing right here.~
@40288 = ~You can keep yapping or you can get moving. Doesn't matter to me, but I can't stand around listening to you all day. Come see me when you're done. Now be on your way.~
@40289 = ~I have to admit, I didn't think you'd stick with it. I'm impressed. The problem with operations like this one is you get a lot of people standing around who are used to action. I don't need a pack of restless crusaders on my hands.~
@40290 = ~Why did you give me such a pointless task?~
@40291 = ~I pretended each sack was your lifeless corpse and that made the task almost enjoyable.~
@40292 = ~I care nothing for your admiration. This was the most meaningless of jobs.~
@40293 = ~The problem with operations like this one is you get a lot of people standing around who are used to action. I don't need a pack of restless crusaders on my hands. ~
@40294 = ~So you burn off their energy by assigning busywork?~
@40295 = ~You almost had a pack of murderous crusaders on your hands this time.~
@40296 = ~I see. There is some wisdom in your attitude.~
@40297 = ~You know the difference between work and useful work now, and you've proven that you can stick with a job. Here, take this. ~
@40298 = ~I appreciate it. Now, I had some more questions.~
@40299 = ~Hm. It will have to do. Now I must be on my way.~
@40300 = ~Ah yes, you helped our poisoned friend. I tip my cap to you. Here, these potions tumbled off the back of a cart not long ago. Terrible bumpy roads around here.~ [BD40300]
@40301 = ~Thank you. I was glad to be of service.~
@40302 = ~Right place, right time. Thanks for the potions, and let me know if anything else "falls off" a cart.~
@40303 = ~This is all the reward I get? It's not enough.~
@40304 = ~It'll have to do. We're not exactly rolling in valuables down here. Now be on your way; I've work to do.~
@40305 = ~I must make do, then. ~
@40306 = ~Oh yes, you cured his illness—after demanding payment. He told me ALL about you... Well, a promise is a promise. Here, these potions fell off the back of a cart not too long ago. Take them and go. I hope that in your time of need, you meet a helpful soul such as yourself.~ [BD40306]
@40307 = ~Here, these potions tumbled off the back of a cart not long ago. I'll hand over what seems fair out of the lot. Take them with my hopes that in your time of need, you meet a helpful soul such as yourself.~
@40308 = ~May the Lady shine upon you always. Much luck to your travels.~
@40309 = ~What did you do that for? I thought I told you it was being taken care of!~
@40310 = ~Your supplies were stuck in this chamber. Now you're free to move them where they're needed.~
@40311 = ~Well, that's gratitude for you.~
@40312 = ~I did what I thought best. I don't require your permission to act.~
@40313 = ~You witless clodpate! We were running out the hourglass. Now we've gotta drag all these blasted crates to the other side of the river!~
@40314 = ~These times try us all.~
@40315 = ~Maybe you can find some bored crusaders to foist the job on to.~
@40316 = ~Your problems are yours to deal with.~
@40317 = ~I suppose we'd have to move the supplies in eventually. I'll let you off this time, but don't let me catch you helping out again! Be on your way!~
@40318 = ~Uh... I won't. I guess.~
@40319 = ~Have fun carrying all these crates. I'd help, but I have important crusader business to attend to. ~
@40320 = ~Fortunately, I have no intention of helping you.~
@40321 = ~Well, much luck to you!~
@40322 = ~Be on your way, then.~
@40323 = ~Wh-who are you? Friend or foe?~
@40324 = ~I'm here to help. What happened to you? What's wrong with your skin?~
@40325 = ~I haven't decided yet. What's your story?~
@40326 = ~What is this? Some sort of trap?~
@40327 = ~Careful, <CHARNAME>. I do not like the looks of this.~
@40328 = ~Th-these people need our help, beloved. We can't s-simply leave them...~
@40329 = ~This place is not likely to hold allies. If we approach at all, it should be with caution. ~
@40330 = ~What is this? Shining knights looking green and sickly? We must help them!~ [BD40330]
@40331 = ~Let them hang. Their plight is no concern of ours.~
@40332 = ~A trap... yes. But laid for us, not by us.~
@40333 = ~Perhaps, but I see no good reason why I should. But very well, let me take a look...~ [BD40333]
@40334 = ~Exploring the caverns we... ugh... we stumbled into this deadly mold. Skin s-softened... bubbled... We can't move, only lie here and wait for death's release.~
@40335 = ~Do not be so quick to resign yourself to your fate. I am here now—what can I do to help?~
@40336 = ~There must be some sort of cure for this illness. ~
@40337 = ~There's nothing I can do for you. ~
@40338 = ~I see no bodies here.~
@40339 = ~They left no bodies behind. Their bodies... unraveled. Transformed into puddles of slime.~
@40340 = ~If I find something that could help you, I'll return. We can discuss payment then.~
@40341 = ~I've met him—Ferrusk is his name. I have a healing potion I found in his chamber. Maybe it can help you?~
@40342 = ~Please... Help us...~
@40343 = ~Ugggh... I feel sick.~
@40344 = ~Don't have much time left... Never thought it'd end... like this...~
@40345 = ~Allll right. I'll play along. What will it take for me to "save" you? Money? An artifact of some kind? ~
@40346 = ~You've returned, but too late!~
@40347 = ~It's too late for me. I can feel myself... changing... AAARGH!~
@40348 = ~The pain is too much! AIIEEE!~
@40349 = ~No! NO! Help me!~
@40350 = ~No! What's happening—? I'm—I can feel myself... changing... AAARGH!~
@40351 = ~Slime Sickness

The crusaders have all been turned into slimes.

I returned to the ill crusaders with the healing potion, but they refused to pay a fair price for it. This cost them greatly in the end; the sickness consumed them, turning them into slimes.~
@40352 = ~H-how can you help? We can't even stand... This sickness has already killed two of my soldiers.~
@40353 = ~There must be something I can do to help.~
@40354 = ~There's nothing I can do for you. You'll have to fare as best you can on your own.~
@40355 = ~I-if in your travels you should, by some miracle, find a remedy for our affliction—I would be forever in your debt. Ugh... farewell...~
@40356 = ~From afar, I have seen a robed figure scraping lichen from the cavern walls. Maybe he has an answer...?~
@40357 = ~I shall seek him out. Hold on as best you can.~
@40358 = ~I'll not waste time on a fool's errand.~
@40359 = ~I am versed in the art of healing. May I examine you?~
@40360 = ~My friend here is versed in the art of healing. Jaheira, would you examine him?~
@40361 = ~Viconia here is a cleric. Perhaps she can help you.~
@40362 = ~M'Khiin, is there anything you can do for this man?~
@40363 = ~Fungus caused his infection. Healing it is beyond my skill. A brew of fungal growths might help, but it would take time to determine the proper ingredients. Too much time, I fear.~
@40364 = ~Yes, this is deadly poison for certain. I have no spell or poultice to aid him. More knowledge than mine is required.~ [BD40364]
@40365 = ~Not to save him. Could put him out of his misery.~ [BD40365]
@40366 = ~If you do bring me a cure, I will be forever in your debt. If you do not, then... augh... farewell.~
@40367 = ~Please. Do what you can. ~
@40368 = ~Your sickness is beyond my skill to heal. But do not despair. I'll go forth and find someone who can help you, or die in the attempt.~
@40369 = ~What's your good health worth to you?~
@40370 = ~I have little to offer. Cure me and I... ugh... I might be able to leave you a reward. At the d-depot.~
@40371 = ~Might? I've little use for might. You're on your own.~
@40372 = ~It will have to do. Your sickness is beyond my skills, but I'll keep an eye out for a cure. If I do manage to find one, I expect to be rewarded, and well, for the effort.~
@40373 = ~My wounds burn... ~
@40374 = ~I've bled out the infection and applied healing herbs. You'll feel stronger soon.~
@40375 = ~Your injuries are beyond my skill to heal.~
@40376 = ~I understand. Thank you for trying.~
@40377 = ~I... I feel stronger already. My dizziness fades. Yes, I believe I can stand now. Thank you, friend. You have done more than I dared hope possible. ~
@40378 = ~Seek out Ladle when you return to the depot. I will ask him to compensate you for your trouble. Now I must lead my soldiers out of here. Farewell.~
@40379 = ~Y-you could help, but you won't... aargh! You're a—a monster by choice. Begone! I can stand the sight of you no longer!~
@40380 = ~You return. ~
@40381 = ~You lost two men? I don't see any bodies here.~
@40382 = ~My friend Glint here has some skill with healing arts. Do you mind if he examines you?~
@40383 = ~Would you be willing to let my friend Glint here have a look at you? He is a capable healer.~
@40384 = ~Strength... fading. The cursed fungus is killing us... Have you... Have you found a cure?~
@40385 = ~No, I haven't. ~
@40386 = ~I think so. I have a potion here that should help.~
@40387 = ~You have? Thank the Lady!~
@40388 = ~Take a sip, and when you feel stronger, you can cure the rest of your soldiers.~
@40389 = ~Thank me; Caelar did nothing but bring you to the brink of oblivion. Here, drink some of this, then help your troops.~
@40390 = ~Actually, I believe I'll keep this potion. You're beyond helping, and I might find a use for it in the future.~
@40391 = ~Not so fast. What about that payment we discussed?~
@40392 = ~Please... hurry. Don't know how—how much longer we can last...~
@40393 = ~My dizziness fades. Yes, I—I believe I can stand now. Thank you, friend. You have done more than I dared hope. Bide a moment while I help the others.~
@40394 = ~I promise I'll be gentle. Let's see what we've got here...~ [BD40394]
@40395 = ~Curse you! A pox upon you and everyone you love! Await my ghost, stranger—in death, I will haunt you the rest of your living days.~
@40396 = ~As I said, I can arrange a reward for you back at the depot.~
@40397 = ~I'll take you at your word. Here, drink this. When you feel stronger, give some to the rest of your soldiers.~
@40398 = ~I'll not hand this potion over for vague promises of reward. Pray to your Shining Lady, crusader—she's the only one who will help you now. For myself, I'll find someone willing and able to properly pay for an elixir such as this.~
@40399 = ~Good. Good food... ~
@40400 = ~Where did you come from, troll?~
@40401 = ~Good food? It's potatoes and onions and they aren't even cooked.~
@40402 = ~I hope you enjoyed the meal, troll, for it will be your last.~
@40403 = ~Yaagh! Crusaders! ~
@40404 = ~Relax, friend. We're no crusaders. I am <CHARNAME>. Who are you?~
@40405 = ~Where? WHERE?~
@40406 = ~You call me a crusader? I should have your head for that insult!~
@40407 = ~Bjarn Littleclub is my name. They kept me locked in cages above, but I managed to get free. Came down here and hid. So hungry. So, so hungry. ~
@40408 = ~Grab as much as you can and go, Littleclub. It's not safe here.~
@40409 = ~Take what you can get and get the hells out of here, troll. This food's about to get spoiled.~
@40410 = ~Get out of here, you wretch. I've no time for your petty mewling.~
@40411 = ~You're... NOT a crusader? ~
@40412 = ~Far from it. We seek their defeat. Who are you? How did you come to be here?~
@40413 = ~Do I look like a crusader? Hint: The answer is "no."~
@40414 = ~I should slay you for even suggesting it.~
@40415 = ~No, no... You're funnier'n they are...~
@40416 = ~What? Wait a tic.~
@40417 = ~Gnahhh! Kill you, crusader! KILL YOU!~
@40418 = ~You're letting this troll just take the food?~
@40419 = ~He's not done us any harm. Why not?~
@40420 = ~You're a good <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <PRO_RACE>. Fate smile on you. Farewell.~
@40421 = ~Mercy, mercy my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I'm going, I'm going...~
@40422 = ~Petty mewling? I'll petty mewl you!~
@40423 = ~Ahh! Crusaders! ~
@40424 = ~I'm not a crusader. We've been through this already.~
@40425 = ~No. No, no, no, no! We talked about this, remember?~
@40426 = ~That's the second time you've called me a crusader. It will be the last.~
@40427 = ~You not change mind about not killing Bjarn?~
@40428 = ~Of course not.~
@40429 = ~Still thinking it over.~
@40430 = ~No. When I first saw you, I decided to kill you, and now I shall.~
@40431 = ~Oh. That good, then.~
@40432 = ~Gnahhh! Kill you KILL YOU!~
@40433 = ~Oh. Right.~
@40434 = ~Let Bjarn know when you decide.~
@40435 = ~Well, I dunno, do I? But we gotta do something, Orland. The Shining Lady's depending on us.~
@40436 = ~What would you have us do, Uxley? They EAT warmblooded folk. I love Caelar, but I don't wanna get ate.~
@40437 = ~I'd rather get ate than fail the Lady.~
@40438 = ~What seems to be the problem?~
@40439 = ~Failure? What sort of talk is that for a follower of Caelar? You disappoint me... What's your name?~
@40440 = ~There are fates worse than death.~
@40441 = ~Sahuagin, that's the problem. A bunch of 'em came out the river, and now they're holed up in yonder cavern. ~
@40442 = ~I must pass through that cavern... Stay here, I'll see what I can do about your fish problem.~
@40443 = ~Well, we can't have that. I'll go take care of it.~
@40444 = ~You allowed this to happen?~
@40445 = ~I wouldn't say we allowed it to happen.~
@40446 = ~I wouldn't say we allowed it to happen. It's more like we couldn't stop it from happening.~
@40447 = ~Sahuagin or no, I need to get through that cavern. Stay here and I'll see what I can do.~
@40448 = ~What would you pay to have me clear the beasts out?~
@40449 = ~Useless wretches. It's a miracle Caelar hasn't cast you out, worthless as you are.~
@40450 = ~You'd have our undying gratitude, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. And I could also give you what gold we have if you got rid of 'em. We're expecting another shipment in a day or two. It won't be going anywhere with those things in there.~
@40451 = ~Keep your gold, friend. I'll take care of this.~
@40452 = ~Wellll... It's not much, but it'll have to do. Give it to me and I'll see what I can do.~
@40453 = ~Hand it over.~
@40454 = ~Good luck dealing with the problem.~
@40455 = ~We could use some good luck right about now.~
@40456 = ~We're not going anywhere—not while the fishfolk block our way. Good fortune go with you.~
@40457 = ~It has to start sometime...~
@40458 = ~Maybe, but death's the most pressing concern from where I'm standing. Who are you now?~
@40459 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. Is there anything I can do to help you?~
@40460 = ~Damn it, man, there's no time for names. What's going on here? What's the problem?~
@40461 = ~You don't ask my name, worm. Who are you?~
@40462 = ~Gods, I hope so.~
@40463 = ~Bless you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. May the Shining Lady smile upon you.~
@40464 = ~I'm Uxley, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. This is Orland. The Shining Lady bid us guard the way here. And we failed. Ah, gods forgive us! Forgive us, Caelar!~
@40465 = ~Vichand is dead! Such is the fate of any enemy of Edwin!~
@40466 = ~If you attack Vichand in camp, we all die. You'll have your vengeance soon, I promise.~
@40467 = ~Your revenge is not my concern. Don't endanger me and you won't endanger our partnership.~
@40468 = ~Then let's do it. Let's kill him now.~
@40469 = ~Much as it PAINS me, I see the logic in your words. His day will come... oh yes. And soon.~ [BD40469]
@40470 = ~YES. You hear that, Vichand? WE COME FOR YOU!~ [BD40470]
@40471 = ~You mean it, <PRO_SIRMAAM>? Oh, gods, bless you, thank you, thank you. ~
@40472 = ~Forgive us, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! We tried to guard the door, we did—the fishmen got the better of us. Is there anything you can do to help us?~
@40473 = ~Fortunately for you, I must pass through the cavern to get where I'm going. Stay here, I'll see what I can do about your fish problem.~
@40474 = ~Get a fire going, lads. We dine on fish this <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@40475 = ~What's it worth to you for me to clear the beasts out?~
@40476 = ~You'd fight these feral fishfolk for free? A fool's feat, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD40476]
@40477 = ~You would have Voghiln eat fish, <CHARNAME>? What next? Lettuce and spinach? Ho ho!~
@40478 = ~I think some roughage wouldn't go amiss for you, wide one.~

@40480 = ~You cannot seriously expect the pride of Thay to consume sahuagin flesh? (It's an abomination, isn't it? Yes, yes, it is, oh yes.)~
@40481 = ~Better eating fish than eaten by worms.~
@40482 = ~Fortunately, we've more choices than that—so far, at least.~
@40483 = ~Feed a man a fish and he eats for a day, they say. Minsc says that must be one big fish...~
@40484 = ~What're you doing? Aren't you going to drive the sahuagin out of the cavern? ~
@40485 = ~I will.~
@40486 = ~Patience, my friend. I'll deal with your sahuagin problem In time.~
@40487 = ~The sahuagin are your problem. Deal with it.~
@40488 = ~Well—good. Get on with it, then.~
@40489 = ~In time? What kind of time are we looking at here?~
@40490 = ~Soon.~
@40491 = ~Later.~
@40492 = ~Well, thanks for everything, then. You've been a great help. ~
@40493 = ~What's the meaning of this? You took our money in exchange for clearing the fishmen out of the cavern. Were you planning on doing this any time soon?~
@40494 = ~I'll take care of it immediately.~
@40495 = ~Patience, my friend. Patience.~
@40496 = ~You have been parted from your money, thus proving the old adage. Deal with the sahuagin yourselves.~
@40497 = ~Well—good. Get on with it, then.~
@40498 = ~That wasn't the deal.~
@40499 = ~That really was not what was agreed to, <CHARNAME>.~
@40500 = ~You steal our gold...? Here then, take my blade as well!~

@40574 = ~She was to have been a great paladin. But something happened to her. Something dark twisted inside her, pulling her from the path she was supposed to walk.~

@40592 = ~Some people have to kick the hornet's nest, just to see if they'll get stung. And she will get stung, in the end.~

@40629 = ~He was a god? ~

@40631 = ~He wasn't a god, but not for lack of trying. His goal was to take what he believed was his rightful place, as the Lord of Murder.~
@40632 = ~He was the son of a dead god. Like his father, he died.~
@40633 = ~Eep! Did he... did he succeed? ~
@40634 = ~Nearly so. It was only his heroic half-sister that prevented him from reaching his sinister goals.~
@40635 = ~He almost did. It was only his heroic half-brother who stopped him.~
@40636 = ~No. For I was there to stop him.~

@41070 = ~At least I've gained something from this mess.~
@41071 = ~See you 'round, friend.~
@41072 = ~Well, that's good to know. I'll just let you be on your way then. ~
@41073 = ~Decision time. Do I stay or go?~
@41074 = ~It's a big choice. You and the Concocter have been together a long time.~
@41075 = ~"The Myconids and the Alchemist." A fine title for a tale of adventure. ~
@41076 = ~I'll leave you to your thoughts.~
@41077 = ~Decisions, decisions. Can I help you with something? ~
@41078 = ~I hate to bother you at such a time, but could I see what you have for sale?~
@41079 = ~Consider the matter on your own time. Let me see what you have to sell.~
@41080 = ~Later, partner.~
@41081 = ~Aw, hells, who am I kidding? Where the Concocter goes, I go. On to adventure!~
@41082 = ~Arbinge strongest! I knock trees over with one hand. I be chief!~
@41083 = ~Cheski strong as you, Arbinge, and have brains too! You not count to two with ettin in front of you!~
@41084 = ~Both you shut your holes NOW!~ [BD41084]
@41085 = ~That one cuts an impressive figure, for an ogre. He could best both the other two together. ~
@41086 = ~Me chief's mate! Me in charge.~ [BD41086]
@41087 = ~That is a FEMALE ogre? ...Interesting. ~

@41107 = ~I ask myself that same question every day. While I ponder the answer, why not tell me your problem? ~
@41108 = ~I overheard you. Half the forest did. Your bellowing will bring every crusader in the area down on us. Tell me what's going on.~

@41140 = ~I see. I had another question. ~

@41143 = ~See Murs cry over Slug! She weak! Slug gone. Arbinge strongest now. Arbinge chief!~
@41144 = ~I can't think about what they might be doing to Slug. Our camp needs a strong leader! ~
@41145 = ~You said the crusaders took over the tunnels? ~
@41146 = ~Perhaps, perhaps not. Let me ask another question.~
@41147 = ~We see shiners carrying barrels and crates into caverns. Heavy going in, not so heavy coming out.~
@41148 = ~I see. I had another question. ~
@41149 = ~This our camp. We hold hills. Charge people toll or just kill 'em, take stuff. Slug lead us, lead good till shiners get him.~
@41150 = ~You're ogre... merchants? ~
@41151 = ~Oh yes, I can see from the vast amount of nothing spread around that you're doing a great trade. ~
@41152 = ~Don't try to mislead me, ogre. ~
@41153 = ~I have some knowledge of the subtle arts. From the look of your setup here, I'd say you're more in the mercenary trade. ~
@41154 = ~We had more stock at our permanant camp, of course. ~
@41155 = ~You're really ogre merchants? ~
@41156 = ~Perfectly understandable. Except for the part where I don't believe a word of it. ~
@41157 = ~You must think I'm an idiot. ~
@41158 = ~We're merchants. Now change the subject or I'll tear your head off. ~
@41159 = ~Merchants it is. I had another question. ~
@41160 = ~Very well. We're brigands. Slug's Brigands, they called us. Now Slug is gone, and we have to decide what to do next. ~
@41161 = ~I see. I had another question. ~
@41162 = ~Chief is strongest one there is. Only one way to know. Me hurt arm in fight, not strong enough to be chief.~
@41163 = ~You seem to be a capable leader, and Slug was your husband. Why don't you take over? ~

@41167 = ~We ogres.~

@41169 = ~What if I were to fight the others? ~
@41170 = ~I'll leave you to your battles, then. ~
@41171 = ~You no ogre! You NOT fight to be chief!~
@41172 = ~You look like you could easily beat them.~
@41173 = ~That's a stupid rule. ~
@41174 = ~It is important to follow traditions, I agree. ~
@41175 = ~Female OGRES, or any females at all? ~
@41176 = ~What if I were to fight as your champion, Murs?~

@41182 = ~What if I were to fight as your champion?~
@41183 = ~Is there a problem with females of other races fighting for leadership, or only ogres?~
@41184 = ~What if I just killed you and Arbinge, Cheski? What would happen then?~

@41187 = ~I'm a strong warrior and could easily defeat the others. ~
@41188 = ~I possess hidden powers that will decimate the others. ~
@41189 = ~There's more to me than what you see. I'll be victorious. ~
@41190 = ~Actually, I think I'll let the others fight it out. ~
@41191 = ~Win for me and I help you. And you help me get Slug back from shiners.~
@41192 = ~If I did this, would you and your ogres support me in battle against the crusade?~
@41193 = ~What sort of reward would you give me? ~
@41194 = ~I'll fight for you and do my best to free your mate.~
@41195 = ~What if I just killed Arbinge and Cheski?~
@41196 = ~I could, but I think I'll let the others fight it out.~
@41197 = ~Yes, yes! Get Slug and we help you!~
@41198 = ~Then I'll be your champion and do my best to get Slug back from the crusade—the "shiners."~
@41199 = ~Actually, I think I'll let the others fight it out. ~
@41200 = ~I'll get you a map of the underground tunnels. If you're fighting the crusade, you could use it. ~
@41201 = ~Then I'll be your champion and do my best to free Slug. ~
@41202 = ~Actually, I think I'll let the others fight it out. ~
@41203 = ~If you killed them alone, you be chief. But have to fight alone. Those rules.~
@41204 = ~And if someone helped me?~
@41205 = ~Then I'll fight for leadership of the camp. ~

@41207 = ~Ogres not follow someone too weak to fight alone!~
@41208 = ~Then I shall fight alone for leadership of this camp. ~
@41209 = ~What if I fought for Murs as leader?~
@41210 = ~I've better things to do than nursemaid a band of ogres. Sort this out amongst yourselves.~
@41211 = ~I have a champion! The stranger fights for me! ~
@41212 = ~WHAT? No <PRO_RACE> beat ogre! ~
@41213 = ~Cheski destroy you! Cheski destroy Arbinge! CHESKI DESTROY! ~
@41214 = ~The stranger challenges for leadership! ~
@41215 = ~No puny <PRO_RACE> be chief!~
@41216 = ~I don't know if you're crazy or just stupid, outsider, but soon you'll be dead! ~
@41217 = ~Then you no good. Go.~
@41218 = ~You did it! ~
@41219 = ~It was a tough fight, I'll say that much. ~
@41220 = ~Killing two would-be ogre chiefs isn't that hard when you're as talented as I am. ~
@41221 = ~Of course I did. ~
@41222 = ~They dead. You chief now.~
@41223 = ~In name only. I've no interest in leading your people and have important matters to attend to elsewhere.~
@41224 = ~Finally, my lifelong dream of leading an ogre tribe has come true. ~
@41225 = ~A new day dawns for your wretched band.~
@41226 = ~Come to finish what you start?~
@41227 = ~I'd see this done without further bloodshed, if possible.~
@41228 = ~Nah. I've reached my ogre-killing quota for the week. Ask me again in a couple days.~
@41229 = ~Only if you're fool enough to attack me.~
@41230 = ~You do it! Now others HAVE to listen to me—might have to bash heads, but I get them sorted out soon enough.~
@41231 = ~Now that you're in charge, is there anything you can do to help me?~
@41232 = ~I'll be happy to leave you to your skull-bashing once I get a proper reward. ~
@41233 = ~It will take a strong and bloodthirsty leader to keep this scum in line. Now, how can you be of use to me?~
@41234 = ~You chief now, but ogres not follow you long. You still <PRO_RACE>.~
@41235 = ~I shan't stay long. I need to get past the crusade—the shiners—and into the tunnels beneath Dragonspear Castle.~
@41236 = ~I won't be able to spend the next few years marinating in my ogre minions' stench? What a shame.~
@41237 = ~If they won't accept me as their leader, they'll see me become their executioner.~
@41238 = ~What you need? Longer you here, less ogres listen to me.~
@41239 = ~I need to get past the crusade and into the tunnels beneath Dragonspear Castle.~
@41240 = ~Give me all the supplies you can spare and tell me how to get beneath Dragonspear.~
@41241 = ~Tell me all there is to know about about the caverns beneath the castle, and do it quickly. I've wasted enough time here.~
@41242 = ~After Arbinge and Cheski, no one fight you. But you better be going. Sooner better than later.~
@41243 = ~Good. Once you go, Murs be chief. Until then, you chief. We do what you say.~
@41244 = ~Most of our goods were left behind when the crusaders attacked, but take this. It might help you. ~
@41245 = ~Thank you. This will help. ~
@41246 = ~If that's all you have, I guess it will have to do. ~
@41247 = ~Down into the Underdark once more. It'll be... strange to return.~ [BD41247]
@41248 = ~Thank you, chief.~
@41249 = ~Forgive me, Murs. I meant no offence. Now, once I confront the crusade, I might need some assistance. Will you and your people be able to help me?~
@41250 = ~Not much point having luck if you're not going to push it. What else can you do for me?~
@41251 = ~Don't push yours. I will require reinforcements when I face Caelar. Will that be a problem?~
@41252 = ~It take time to get others in line. But when time comes, we be ready to fight with you.~
@41253 = ~Then victory is assured.~
@41254 = ~Surprise ogre reinforcements are never a bad thing to have in a battle. ~
@41255 = ~See that you are. ~
@41256 = ~What more you want?~
@41257 = ~I think we can still help each other. I have no need to take over your camp. I just want to get through those underground tunnels. ~
@41258 = ~What I really need is some help getting through the underground tunnels.~
@41259 = ~You must know how to get through the underground tunnels. Tell me. ~
@41260 = ~Most of our goods were left behind when the crusaders attacked, but you can take this. ~
@41261 = ~If you find Slug, please let him go. I give you all I have.~
@41262 = ~Thank you. I'll be on my way now. ~
@41263 = ~Great, this will help. My apologies for the earlier misunderstanding and rampant killing. ~
@41264 = ~This had better be accurate, or I'll return and slaughter the rest of you. ~
@41265 = ~O Vaprak, help this <PRO_RACE> find my Slug. Bring him back to me... please.~
@41266 = ~You go now.~
@41267 = ~You go now. There nothing else I can do for you.~
@41268 = ~You again. I didn't expect to see you up here.~ [BD41268]
@41269 = ~Kaelet? Umar? What are you two doing here? ~
@41270 = ~Neither did I. I always end up in the strangest places...~
@41271 = ~You two still live? I expected you to be ankheg food by now.~
@41272 = ~It was hard finding our way out of the tunnels. We started to doubt our decision. Then we saw daylight. So bright it almost blinded us! Umar was frightened at first, but I told him we had to be brave if we wanted to make our new life.~ [BD41272]
@41273 = ~So bright it almost blinded us! Umar was frightened at first, but I told him we had to be brave if we wanted to make our new life. ~
@41274 = ~Were it not for your strength, Kaelet, I would not have had the courage to leave. You are the darkness that gives me comfort.~ [BD41274]
@41275 = ~And YOU are my true love forever. ~
@41276 = ~Ugh. Can we kill them, please? I can't listen to more of this.~ [BD41276]
@41277 = ~We followed the light to the surface and tried to find a place to camp while we decided where to go next. ~
@41278 = ~After reaching the surface, we sought some place to take shelter while we determined our next move. That's when we saw smoke from the ogres' fire. We asked to join them. Murs agreed.~
@41279 = ~I'm glad you to find you well. But will life among ogres suit you?~
@41280 = ~From drow to ogres. I guess that's a step up.~
@41281 = ~I've heard enough of this tedious tale.~
@41282 = ~Certainly. We've seen many new things already, and the ogres say we can remain with them so long as we pull our weight.~
@41283 = ~I'm glad you found a place to stay. You'll do fine.~
@41284 = ~I never thought I'd see ogres and drow living together.~
@41285 = ~Then I'll leave you to your work.~
@41286 = ~We really can't thank you enough. ~
@41287 = ~I am sure you've more important things to do than speak with us, so we will leave you to them. Farewell, <CHARNAME>.~
@41288 = ~You not go here. This secret place.~
@41289 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. I seek the underground river. Can I reach it from here?~
@41290 = ~And a fine secret it is. However, I really must get past you.~
@41291 = ~Are you with the crusade?~
@41292 = ~If you won't let me pass, I'll not let you live.~
@41293 = ~Oh. Ah, I must have taken a wrong turn somewhere. Forgive me. I'll just be on my way.~
@41294 = ~Me said you not go through here. ~
@41295 = ~What is through here? Is it the underground river I've heard flows beneath this land?~
@41296 = ~You are too eager to dismiss a fellow servant of Caelar, my friend. See here, I carry the Shining Lady's standard.~
@41297 = ~I'm going to give you a chance, cyclops: Stand aside while standing's still an option you possess.~
@41298 = ~YOU again? Bugger. I must have taken a wrong turn somewhere. I'll be on my way.~
@41299 = ~Me crusader. You not look like crusader. You go 'way, me stay here and guard.~
@41300 = ~And you've proof of that?~
@41301 = ~Only my word.~
@41302 = ~Of course. I carry the standard of Caelar's crusade.~
@41303 = ~I have this sigil.~
@41304 = ~You are no crusader. I'll give you one chance to leave. Now begone.~
@41305 = ~Where you get that?~
@41306 = ~From the Shining Lady herself, in recognition of my bravery.~
@41307 = ~I was tasked with infiltrating the enemy forces. This lets me identify myself to fellow crusaders.~
@41308 = ~I required it on my mission for the Lady. I can't share the details—you understand.~
@41309 = ~Then you crusade like me. We friends. You pass.~
@41310 = ~Of course, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Please, proceed.~
@41311 = ~You've proven the truth of your words. Go forward, in the Lady's light.~
@41312 = ~Me tear your arms off!~

@41317 = ~Your watery might is no match for my arcane powers.~
@41318 = ~Careful, you're getting my spellbook wet!~
@41319 = ~A force of water elementals on the battlefield should make quite a "splash"!~

@41323 = ~My friend is a cleric. Viconia, can you help this man?~
@41324 = ~You would do battle with Strunk of Silverymoon? Well, this is a lucky happenstance—it will be an ideal test of my control over my minions. Elementals, attack!~ [BD41324]
@41325 = ~You FOOL. The crusade needed those troops! You will die for what you've done!~ [BD41325]

@41341 = ~I require information. Cease your gesticulating and give me answers.~
@41342 = ~I tell you I AM a crusader.~

@41522 = ~Through experimentation and magic, I have enhanced some of the local fauna.~
@41523 = ~To what end?~
@41524 = ~Magically enhanced animals, good idea. I'm sure that won't come back to haunt you.~
@41525 = ~So you're the reason I was attacked? Why would you do such a thing?~
@41526 = ~To my own ends.~
@41527 = ~By the terms of my bargain with Hephernaan, I am permitted to perform my experiments.~

@41541 = ~To even consider your request, I should require a substantial sum—2000 gold, at least.~
@41542 = ~Very well, I shall return with that amount.~
@41543 = ~2000 gold pieces? I can do that. Here, take it.~
@41544 = ~That's outrageous. I'll find some other way to obtain a cure.~

@41634 = ~Then I shall set them free. After that, we'll find whoever did this and make them pay.~
@41635 = ~You heard her, dragonlings. Time to find some peace.~
@41636 = ~I shall visit a quick death upon them.~
@41637 = ~Raaaaw! Aaaugh! ~
@41638 = ~Your screams pain me. How long have you been trapped here?~
@41639 = ~Easy there, little fellow. I'm here to help. If I can.~
@41640 = ~Cease your growling or I will end you.~
@41641 = ~Screeeech! ~
@41642 = ~I see your stumpy, broken cobweb wings, your blind eyes. You've been here years, haven't you? Generations...~
@41643 = ~I've never seen a dragon's nest in such a shambles as this. Have you ever been outside? Been ANYWHERE other than this dismal place?~
@41644 = ~Do not fear me, young one. I bring you the only release you can ever have—that of death.~
@41645 = ~Aaaaaugh! Rwwwar! ~
@41646 = ~I see the bones of your hatchmates strewn on the ground. You've done the unthinkable to survive.~
@41647 = ~I'm guesing mice and voles weren't enough sustain you, judging by those wyrmling corpses over there?~
@41648 = ~What little sense you make is fast leaving you.~
@41649 = ~Screech! Graaaaugh! ~
@41650 = ~I would give anything to be able to help you, child, but my abilities are limited. There is but one thing I can offer you, and that is a quick, relatively plainless death.~
@41651 = ~I wouldn't want my worst enemy to live like this. Well, maybe my WORST enemy. But you've done nothing to deserve it.~
@41652 = ~Calm yourself, young one. I bring you the only release you can ever have—that of death.~
@41653 = ~RAAAAARGH! ~
@41654 = ~Thank you.~
@41655 = ~Prematarai~
@41656 = ~You ARE dead now—you are simply too fool to realize it yet.~
@41657 = ~The wychlaran. She should adequately serve the Profane One's needs.~
@41658 = ~You would take Minsc's witch? Pick another Hell, devil, for I shall send you there!~ [BD41658]
@41659 = ~What say you, oh mighty hero?~
@41660 = ~So be it. Ask me your riddle. If I cannot answer it true, Dynaheir is yours.~
@41661 = ~I'll not lose one as dear as Dynaheir to the likes of you, Profane One.~
@41662 = ~It's a poor <PRO_MANWOMAN> indeed who'd sacrifice a friend in the manner you suggest. If I can't answer your riddle, mine is the soul you will take. Agreed?~
@41663 = ~I'll not play this game with you, devil. Stand aside, or pay the price.~
@41664 = ~Very well, then. Thrix shall pick another.~ [BD41664]
@41665 = ~The cowardly warrior. He'll suffice. Thrix will take him.~
@41666 = ~No! I'll not lose my beloved again!~
@41667 = ~Come now. Surely you'll be happier without th-th-this one's stammering bothering you.~
@41668 = ~Ask me your riddle. If I cannot answer it, Khalid is yours.~
@41669 = ~Surrender Khalid to the pit? I say no—not now, not ever!~
@41670 = ~It's a poor <PRO_MANWOMAN> indeed who'd sacrifice a friend in such a way. If I can't answer your riddle, mine is the soul you will take. Agreed?~
@41671 = ~I tire of this game, devil. Let me into the tower. NOW.~
@41672 = ~So be it. Thrix will choose another soul for our wager.~
@41673 = ~Yon druid shall be our prize. She has an admirable strength of spirit. Thrix can smell it. The Profane One would enjoy snuffing that spirit out.~
@41674 = ~I'll snuff you out first, devil, you and all the fires of this pit of Hell!~ [BD41674]
@41675 = ~What do you say? Lose the wager, lose the druid. It gets no fairer than that.~
@41676 = ~Sorry, Jaheira. I have no choice. All right, Thrix. You have your bet.~
@41677 = ~Risk Jaheira's soul on a devil's wager? I think not. Choose another.~
@41678 = ~It's a poor <PRO_MANWOMAN> indeed who'd sacrifice a friend in such a way. If I can't answer your riddle, mine is the soul you will take. Agreed?~
@41679 = ~Here's my offer, devil. Let me into the tower now and I'll not see you torn apart. You'll get no better than that.~
@41680 = ~You make things difficult, <PRO_RACE>. Let Thrix see, who shall he take if he prevails?~
@41681 = ~The ranger. He reeks of madness. He will do well in the Profane One's service. Lose the bet and he will be Thrix's.~
@41682 = ~<CHARNAME>, no! Thou cannot allow this to happen! I will not permit it.~ [BD41682]
@41683 = ~One little ranger if you cannot answer the riddle. Well, perhaps not so little, as human men go, but you understand Thrix's meaning. 'Tis not so much to ask, now is it?~
@41684 = ~All right, Thrix. You have your bet. Sorry, Minsc.~
@41685 = ~Think again, foul one. Minsc will walk out of this place at my side.~
@41686 = ~You think I would risk a friend like Minsc in such a way? Think again. If I can't answer your riddle, mine is the soul you will take. Agreed?~
@41687 = ~I'm done playing with you, devil. Stand aside, or pay the price.~
@41688 = ~Ah! Fine. Who else is there...?~
@41689 = ~Thy soul belongs to Thrix, wychlaran. The Profane One's mark is drawn indelibly upon it. Thou'rt his now.~
@41690 = ~Forgive me, Dynaheir. I thought—I'm sorry.~
@41691 = ~And you are mine, fiend. This fool's game is at an end, and so is your wretched existence.~
@41692 = ~Rejoice now, st-st-stammering one. You soul belongs to Thrix. Can you feel the Profane One's mark upon it? Thrix can...~
@41693 = ~I tried, Khalid. I'm sorry.~
@41694 = ~Can you feel your imminent death approaching, Thrix? I can.~
@41695 = ~You have a poor attitude, druid. Thrix will help you with that.~
@41696 = ~I am so sorry, Jaheira. I thought I could do this—I was wrong.~
@41697 = ~You're about to get a taste of MY poor attitude, fiend.~
@41698 = ~Your soul is marked by Thrix now, ranger—and the Profane One will make an appetizer of the hamster, as well.~
@41699 = ~What have I done? Minsc, forgive me, my friend. I am so, so sorry.~
@41700 = ~One step too far, fiend. You should never have brought Boo into this.~
@41701 = ~You will have nothing, devil—nothing but a quick end to your miserable existence!~
@41702 = ~Thou shalt not take me, devil!~ [BD41702]
@41703 = ~This d-d-devil may take my soul, but he'll not take it without a fight!~ [BD41703]
@41704 = ~Come and get me, devil—if you can!~
@41705 = ~No! Minsc will not go quietly into this bad, BAD night! For Boo! For JUSTICE!~ [BD41705]
@41706 = ~You played a dangerous game with that devil back there. Do not do so again.~
@41707 = ~Minsc knew you would never sacrifice him, <CHARNAME>. Boo... Boo was not so sure. Best you give him time to cool off.~
@41708 = ~I d-don't know what you were thinking, wagering my life—even if you never intended to let the devil collect. Next time, ask before you act.~ [BD41708]
@41709 = ~I am my own woman, <CHARNAME>. Act as though I am property to be wagered and lost again and thou shalt come to regret it.~ [BD41709]
@41710 = ~Thrix will take one of your friends.~
@41711 = ~Very well. I'll play your game.~
@41712 = ~You ask me to risk a friend to a devil's game? No. We'll do this, but my soul, not one of theirs, will be the prize.~
@41713 = ~That's not going to happen.~
@41714 = ~Hold your attacks! Fall back!~ [BD41714]
@41715 = ~Stand your ground. Rein the driders in.~ [BD41715]
@41716 = ~This assault benefits neither of us. I suggest a parley.~ [BD41716]
@41717 = ~I suggest you withdraw.~ [BD41717]
@41718 = ~What's going on here? Why are you fighting?~
@41719 = ~Is there any chance, any chance at all, I could just pass through this little war zone and be on my way?~
@41720 = ~As entertaining as it is to watch you slaughter each other, I must get by.~
@41721 = ~These drow attacked us without provocation. We were defending ourselves. ~
@41722 = ~And what do the drow say?~
@41723 = ~That sounds like drow, all right.~
@41724 = ~I see. And how's that going for you?~
@41725 = ~Doing a poor job of defending yourself, it seems.~
@41726 = ~Who cares what the drow say?~
@41727 = ~We did not come here to fight— Wait. Who is that at your side? Viconia? Viconia DeVir? Can it truly be you?~ [BD41727]
@41728 = ~Shapur. It's been a long time.~ [BD41728]
@41729 = ~You two know each other?~
@41730 = ~Isn't that nice? Long-lost drow friends reunited by chance in the caverns beneath Dragonspear. It brings a tear to my eye.~
@41731 = ~If you know this woman, Viconia, tell her to get out of our way.~
@41732 = ~It has been a long time, but not long enough for my taste. Viconia of House DeVir. It sickens me to look upon you.~
@41733 = ~Ho! Mind your tone—Viconia's a friend of mine. I'll not let you speak ill of her in my presence.~
@41734 = ~She's not my favorite person, either. What can I say? I need a healer.~
@41735 = ~Whatever bad blood you have with Viconia is no concern of mine.~
@41736 = ~I've a cure for your sickness right here, you contemptuous pilgarlic...~
@41737 = ~<CHARNAME>, please. You'll only make things worse.~ [BD41737]
@41738 = ~Worse? How is that even possible? Your actions are unforgivable, DeVir—beyond any justification. You turned your back on the Spider Queen!~
@41739 = ~The past is past. Viconia has proved herself to me time and again. She is a trusted friend.~
@41740 = ~I defer to your wisdom in this matter, Viconia.~
@41741 = ~If I ever met someone called the Spider Queen, I sure wouldn't turn my back on her.~
@41742 = ~I care little for you and not at all for your queen of spiders, drow.~
@41743 = ~Dismiss Lolth at your own peril, <PRO_RACE>...~
@41744 = ~You did not come here to argue theology, Shapur. Tell us why you have ventured this far up from the Underdark.~ [BD41744]
@41745 = ~Very well. I will pretend you are nothing more than a dung-covered rat fawning at this traveler's heels.~
@41746 = ~Do not mention it again and you can do as you will. Now explain yourself. Why are you here?~
@41747 = ~Charming. Pray continue.~
@41748 = ~My patience wears thin. Viconia's past is of no consequence. It's what brought you here this <DAYNIGHTALL> that concerns me.~
@41749 = ~If you wish to side with her, then you can die with her. ~
@41750 = ~We did not come here to battle, but we'll not shy away from it. We were content to go about our search in peace—this bunjiro surfacer and her b'lath attacked us!~
@41751 = ~What exactly were you searching for?~
@41752 = ~You focus on the past at the expense of the future. We've got to leave that behind and focus on resolving this, preferably with as few limbs hacked off as possible. What is it you seek?~
@41753 = ~This means nothing to me. Sort it out amongst yourselves.~
@41754 = ~Perhaps I can mediate? I am not without experience in the art of diplomacy.~
@41755 = ~Your people attacked us. We were only searching for something. ~
@41756 = ~Searching for what, exactly?~
@41757 = ~That would be a pretty thin story even if it weren't coming from a drow. What's this "something" you were searching for?~
@41758 = ~You bore me. Speak plainly or get out of my way.~
@41759 = ~Perhaps I can mediate? I am a talented wordsmith with no little experience in the diplomatic arts.~
@41760 = ~Careful. Better to bargain with a scorpion than deal with a drow.~
@41761 = ~That's no business of yours, surface-dweller.~
@41762 = ~I am trying to avoid further bloodshed. If I can find what you seek, will you return from whence you came—in peace?~
@41763 = ~Don't be so quick to judge. I can find what you're missing—for the right price.~
@41764 = ~I should have known better than to try reasoning with a drow. Come on then. If you're not interested in talking, you might as well get started dying.~
@41765 = ~I'll not bargain with a surface-dweller. Begone!~
@41766 = ~I wish only to help you. If you don't tell me what you're looking for, I can do little for you. What is it you seek here in this place?~
@41767 = ~Hey now. There's no call for insults, certainly not ones made at my expense. Tell me what you're looking for. I'll find it for you.~
@41768 = ~While you are an intransigent drow and therefore expendable. Die!~
@41769 = ~One more insult like that and you'll lie in pieces on the ground. ~
@41770 = ~I spoke hastily. Please continue.~
@41771 = ~It is you who will be torn apart, foul drow!~
@41772 = ~Kill them all!~
@41773 = ~Two young drow, little more than adolescents, are lost in these tunnels. Bring them back unharmed and I will spare your life.~ [BD41773]
@41774 = ~I will find them and return them to you.~
@41775 = ~You offer me something I already have. You'll need to do better than that if you want your children back.~
@41776 = ~If I see them, I might return them. If it suits me.~
@41777 = ~Your continued existence. ~
@41778 = ~I... suppose that's fair.~
@41779 = ~You clearly don't want your children back very much.~
@41780 = ~We are searching for two young drow. Adolescents, lost in the tunnels.~ [BD41780]
@41781 = ~Bide here a time. I will seek them out and bring them back to you as soon as I'm able.~
@41782 = ~How much would you be willing to pay to see them returned?~
@41783 = ~If I should encounter them, I may bring them back. If it suits my purpose. Farewell.~
@41784 = ~Many thanks for the help, stranger. We could have taken the drow, but it would have cost us dearly. They are experienced warriors, especially in surroundings such as these.~
@41785 = ~I'm happy to be of service.~
@41786 = ~I don't want to be thanked. I want to be paid.~
@41787 = ~Your soldiers are a disgrace. Their performance is an embarrassment to the crusade.~
@41788 = ~I will award you as I see fit, depending on how well you serve.~
@41789 = ~Hold... Is that a drow I see following you?~
@41790 = ~Well, with an incentive like that, how could I fail?~
@41791 = ~Indeed. Baeloth has been a great help to me in my adventures.~
@41792 = ~A drow? Where?!~
@41793 = ~And if it is? Whom I keep company with is no concern of yours.~
@41794 = ~It is strange to see one of my own kind so humbly following a lowly <PRO_RACE>. You have him well-trained.~
@41795 = ~Were it not for me, they would've been terminated ten times over. Ten times ten times over!~ [BD41795]
@41796 = ~It's true. Baeloth is a valued ally. And now I need his assistance.~
@41797 = ~You'll have to forgive Baeloth; he has a gift for overstatement. Even so, I can't deny that he comes in handy at times. We'll be off now.~
@41798 = ~Enough. It is past time we were on our way.~
@41799 = ~Yes. Run along after your owner now. Away with you.~
@41800 = ~Away with you all. Do not return without our young ones.~
@41801 = ~Cretin! We could have been killed in the time it took you to slay that monster.~ [BD41801]
@41802 = ~Kaelet. They don't talk like us on the surface, remember?~ [BD41802]
@41803 = ~Oh yes, I forgot. What I meant to say was...~
@41804 = ~Was... oh, I just had it.~
@41805 = ~Thank you? ~
@41806 = ~Are we to speak like surface-dwellers now? I suppose on the surface they would offer thanks. How tiresome. Very well, "thank you" for saving us.~ [BD41806]
@41807 = ~You're welcome.~
@41808 = ~I'm always happy to save a life and then provide a valuable lesson in surface etiquette.~
@41809 = ~I take it you're the ones that drow search party I encountered are looking for.~
@41810 = ~Why did you save us? You must expect something in return.~
@41811 = ~I ask nothing but that you let me return you to your people. They are searching for you.~
@41812 = ~Assuming you have no money—you have no money, do you? No? Thought not—you can repay me simply by coming with me. We'll leave my reward to Shapur.~
@41813 = ~I came here to retrieve you. Come with me.~
@41814 = ~You're here to take us back? No! We won't go. ~
@41815 = ~Why not? Are you afraid of something?~
@41816 = ~You don't have much of a choice. You can't even fight off one giant mutant ankheg on your own.~
@41817 = ~I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.~
@41818 = ~No! We won't go. There's nothing for us back home. We'd just face punishment, especially me.~
@41819 = ~Why especially you?~
@41820 = ~I'm sure you have a fine career as a drow... whatever drow do... ahead of you. Now come on.~
@41821 = ~Then return, and face your punishment like adults.~
@41822 = ~Because I'm a boy, obviously. ~
@41823 = ~And that's bad?~
@41824 = ~So it was your idea to run away?~
@41825 = ~Unlike other races, drow are matriarchial. The women are in charge. ~
@41826 = ~I see.~
@41827 = ~Did your girlfriend here convince you to run away, then?~
@41828 = ~That doesn't change the fact that these youngsters must return home.~
@41829 = ~I'm male and a servant of low caste. We both decided to run, but should we be caught my punishment will be much more severe than Kaelet's.~
@41830 = ~Why did you flee the Underdark? Life above is not easy for your kind.~
@41831 = ~Uh-oh. I think I see where this is going.~
@41832 = ~That is unfortunate for you, though not as unfortunate as what will happen should you attempt to defy me.~
@41833 = ~I am a daughter of one of the great houses, while Umar is just a servant. He's so pretty and amusing, though, I decided I must have him. My mother would never let us be together, so we ran away. On the surface, we'll make a new home, and I can do as I like with him.~ [BD41833]
@41834 = ~You are young, and young love—or whatever you have—is often fleeting. If you follow through with your plan, you may come to regret it.~
@41835 = ~I was afraid of that.~
@41836 = ~Love makes fools of those weak enough to indulge it.~
@41837 = ~Baeloth, do you have any advice for this young couple?~
@41838 = ~Viconia, can you talk some sense into them?~
@41839 = ~My surface sojourn has not been smooth, 'tis true. I shall share several stories that might serve to illustrate—~ [BD41839]
@41840 = ~Baeloth? The sorcerer?~
@41841 = ~You know my name? My infamy infiltrates even the Underdark! Naturally, I'm not surprised.~ [BD41841]
@41842 = ~It is, it's really him! Baeloth the Idiotainer!~
@41843 = ~Baeloth the Idiotainer!~
@41844 = ~Idio-what now? Your abusive appellation is absent the appropriate awe one should associate with so illustrious an enchanter as the Entertaining One, Baeloth Barrityl!~ [BD41844]
@41845 = ~Oh, this is too good.~ [BD41845]
@41846 = ~The legendary Baeloth the charlatan, eking out his living performing tricks for surface-dwellers.~
@41847 = ~They've heard of you. How wonderful!~ [BD41847]
@41848 = ~"Eking out a living"? My powerful performances earn a preponderance of platinum!~ [BD41848]
@41849 = ~Truly? Well then, just as you have been successful on the surface, so will we be.~
@41850 = ~This isn't what I had in mind, Baeloth. ~
@41851 = ~Well, THAT sure straightened them out. Thanks, Baeloth.~
@41852 = ~Enough of this.~
@41853 = ~Apologies, I... got carried away. ~
@41854 = ~Let's go back a bit. Why exactly are you running away again? ~
@41855 = ~I too made the decision to leave the Underdark. It was not a path easily walked.~ [BD41855]
@41856 = ~But you made it, right? You succeeded?~
@41857 = ~I did, but I paid a high price. In a moment, I lost all family and friends. My history, my connection to our people, was gone.~ [BD41857]
@41858 = ~You must have built a new life on the surface.~
@41859 = ~In time. But even now I'm seen as an intruder in the sunlight. An evil drow not to be trusted. I am outcast both above and below.~ [BD41859]
@41860 = ~Oh. I see.~
@41861 = ~Viconia speaks with wisdom.~
@41862 = ~Even I don't really trust Viconia, so that tells you how hard it's been for her.~
@41863 = ~Enough of this.~
@41864 = ~Perhaps we didn't think this all the way through. ~
@41865 = ~Love clouds even the best judgment. I think you know what you must do, though.~
@41866 = ~I'll say. Can we get going now?~
@41867 = ~At last, you see reason. ~
@41868 = ~I don't care. I won't give Umar up. He'll follow me and do as I say.~
@41869 = ~I can't let you wander off to die in the darkness. You must return to your families—it's the right thing to do.~
@41870 = ~No, you won't, because you're going back to Shapur right now. Cease your whining and go to the northern cavern where she waits.~
@41871 = ~Tell it to Shapur—she will surely care more than I do. Now cease your whining and follow me.~
@41872 = ~If that's truly how you feel, I'll not stand in the way of true love. But escaping those who search for you will not be easy.~
@41873 = ~Perhaps <PRO_HESHE> is right, Kaelet. Strong as you are, you might not be able to protect us on the surface.~
@41874 = ~How irritating. We'll return to our families, then, until I think of another plan. Be ready to come when I summon you.~
@41875 = ~I will be waiting, mistress.~
@41876 = ~That's very, uh, romantic. Now head to the northern cavern where Shapur waits.~
@41877 = ~Go on, get out of here before I have to listen to any more of this. The northern cavern is where your people wait.~
@41878 = ~Make your way home, then. The way back may be dangerous.~
@41879 = ~You can't force us to go with you. We'd rather die than part. Even if you capture us we'll run away again as soon as we're able.~
@41880 = ~Far be it from me to try and stand in the way of true love. But escaping those who search for you will not be easy.~
@41881 = ~I'm not the one you need to be concerned with. It's your people you should be worried about.~
@41882 = ~If I don't return you to Shapur, I risk her wrath falling upon me. That is a risk I'm not prepared to take.~
@41883 = ~There must be a way to escape Shapur... Ah! I have it. Here—we each have our house insignia. Take them to Shapur and tell her we are dead. That should turn her back to the Underdark.~
@41884 = ~Are you certain you'll not be turned from this path? It won't be easy for you on the surface... Very well. Give me the insignia and be on your way. Luck to you.~
@41885 = ~Well, it's better than nothing. Maybe I'll soak them in ankheg stomach juices first.~
@41886 = ~Very well. Off with you then, and make sure Shapur and the others don't spy you trying to escape.~
@41887 = ~We're ready.~
@41888 = ~Farewell. We'll never forget you.~
@41889 = ~Welcome back.~ [BD41889]
@41890 = ~Have you found our children?~ [BD41890]
@41891 = ~I'm still searching. I'll return as soon as I have them.~
@41892 = ~Hold your horses—er, spiders. I'm looking for them.~
@41893 = ~Their fate does not concern me.~
@41894 = ~I have, but you'll not thank me for doing so.~
@41895 = ~Get out of my sight, then.~
@41896 = ~What do you mean, bad news?~
@41897 = ~Your kin were attacked by a giant ankheg.~

@41901 = ~What? What do you mean? ~
@41902 = ~They were slain by the ankhegs that make these caverns their home. I was too late to save them. I took these symbols from what little the ankhegs left of them.~
@41903 = ~They'd been dead some time before I found them. Their bodies were mostly eaten. My heart aches for their families—I can think of nothing worse than losing a child. I would have saved them if I could. As it is, all I am able to do is return their insignia to you.~
@41904 = ~I'm sorry, I couldn't save them. I brought back their insignia for their families.~
@41905 = ~They're dead, but at least you've been spared hours of searching for them. Here, I brought you their insignias. Take them and begone back from whence you came.~
@41906 = ~You heard what I said. Take these tokens and withdraw from this area.~

@41946 = ~They wanted to flee your cruel society and in truth, I cannot blame them. Anything is better than living with drow.~

@41975 = ~Yeah! Where is that stuff?~ [BD41975]
@41976 = ~Yes, yes, what is it now?~ [BD41976]
@41977 = ~I've been thinking, Safana.~
@41978 = ~Safana. Tomorrow, I begin a journey to Dragonspear to face Caelar the Shining Lady. I would have you join me.~
@41979 = ~There is nothing I wish to say to you. Begone.~
@41980 = ~Don't strain yourself, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD41980]

@41985 = ~There. That humor, that spirit. That is why I would have you join me on my trek north.~
@41986 = ~I was thinking that, in spite of your poor attitude, I would like you to join me on my journey to Dragonspear Castle.~
@41987 = ~Mind your tongue, woman.~
@41988 = ~Why would I want to do that?~ [BD41988]
@41989 = ~Caelar poses a dire threat to the city—to the entire Sword Coast. I know not what she plans, only that it must be stopped, at any cost.~
@41990 = ~Running off on a journey with another man would drive Coran mad.~
@41991 = ~I heard you fighting with Coran earlier. It sounded like you could use a break from him, if nothing else.~
@41992 = ~That is not for me to say. The offer is there. Join me or don't.~
@41993 = ~Perhaps you should mind it for me.~ [BD41993]
@41994 = ~Perhaps I should. I travel to Dragonspear Castle to face Caelar's crusade on the morrow. Join me.~
@41995 = ~Ew. No. That's it, we're done.~
@41996 = ~I could cut it from your skull and keep it with me always.~

@41998 = ~Not what I had in mind. Fare thee well.~ [BD41998]

@42000 = ~At dawn, from the Ducal Palace.~
@42001 = ~I'll see you there.~
@42002 = ~My heart is breaking. Fare thee well.~ [BD42002]
@42003 = ~Personal sacrifice isn't really my style. But I suppose a break from this city—and from Coran—wouldn't be so bad. All right, you have persuaded me—I shall join you.~ [BD42003]
@42004 = ~Yes, well. That tells me why you'd want me to join you, but it does leave one rather important question unanswered. So tell me, joining you...~ [BD42004]
@42005 = ~Not the most enticing offer I've had in my life. But some time away from the city—and its ferret-faced, mask-wearing libertine elf swine citizens—might be just what I need. Just what I need... Very well. I accept your invitation.~ [BD42005]
@42006 = ~Safana says she'll meet me at the Ducal Palace tomorrow. I'm not sure I believe her. She doesn't strike me as the most reliable of collaborators.~
@42007 = ~Unknowable Horror~
@42008 = ~What is it you want now?~ [BD42008]
@42009 = ~Nothing more than to talk with you, dear lady.~
@42010 = ~I thought we might talk.~
@42011 = ~You deserve better company than the duergar. Would you consider joining me?~
@42012 = ~I want nothing from you, drow.~
@42013 = ~Talk, and nothing more? I know what men want from me.~ [BD42013]
@42014 = ~You don't know what this man wants from you.~
@42015 = ~I want nothing you don't.~
@42016 = ~You think too much of yourself—and too little of me. Farewell.~

@42018 = ~We do. I would have you by my side.~
@42019 = ~Don't tell me you prefer Hammerlust's company to mine.~
@42020 = ~As you wish. Farewell.~
@42021 = ~I want nothing from you.~ [BD42021]
@42022 = ~Strength is not only inside, but also in the strength of those who walk beside you—not over you, as Hammerlust would.~
@42023 = ~Give me the chance to prove you wrong. Join me.~
@42024 = ~Then enjoy the duergar's company, drow. You deserve each other.~
@42025 = ~Me? Join you? That would drive Pfaug mad. ~
@42026 = ~Me? Join you? That would drive Pfaug mad.~ [BD42026]
@42027 = ~Then you're in luck. Nothing is exactly what you shall receive.~ [BD42027]
@42028 = ~Pfaug is crude. But honest in his intentions. Can you say the same?~ [BD42028]
@42029 = ~Farewell.~ [BD42029]
@42030 = ~Do not try to tell me my own mind. You won't like the result.~ [BD42030]
@42031 = ~Join me and I'd not have to guess at your thoughts.~
@42032 = ~As you wish. Farewell.~
@42033 = ~Don't give me orders. You'll like that even less.~
@42034 = ~Oh? And what is that?~ [BD42034]
@42035 = ~As I said: the pleasure of your company. Leave that dwarf to walk his fool's road and join me.~
@42036 = ~Nothing. I look upon you and see nothing, feel nothing—what is there to want?~
@42037 = ~Begone, then. I grow weary of your voice.~ [BD42037]
@42038 = ~Oy! "Hero"! I'll have words wi' you.~ [BD42038]
@42039 = ~What can I do for you, Master Hammerlust?~
@42040 = ~Any particular words? Or shall we just select them randomly? Water. Xylophone. Crepuscular. Oh, that's a good one.~
@42041 = ~No. You won't.~
@42042 = ~Y'think ye're funny, do ye? ~
@42043 = ~Forgive me. I see you're in no mood for humor. What can I do for you?~
@42044 = ~I have my moments.~
@42045 = ~No. I think you're funny.~
@42046 = ~Y'stole me feldurkin' drow! Give 'er back, or by Abbathor I'll split ye in two, crown to crotch!~
@42047 = ~You think me a possession, Pfaug? Can it be you are even more stupid than I thought?~ [BD42047]
@42048 = ~...Whut?~
@42049 = ~Begone. I want nothing more to do with you.~ [BD42049]
@42050 = ~Y'stinkin' worm, I should have yer head off for that! Y'stole me bluddy drow! Give 'er back, or by Abbathor I'll split ye in two, crown to crotch!~ [BD42050]
@42051 = ~Whud're ye lookin' at?~ [BD42051]
@42052 = ~Forgive me, friend. I was just wondering how it is you come to serve the Flaming Fist.~
@42053 = ~I wasn't looking at any particular thing—just looking around in general.~
@42054 = ~I was looking at you. Is that a problem?~
@42055 = ~I dun't like bein' looked at in general. Or specific. Do yer gazin' in someone else's direction.~ [BD42055]
@42056 = ~Yer good luck, that's how. I heard the Argent wench wuz offerin' good gold fer mercenaries an' wuz in the Gate makin' me way north when I, ah, had a little trouble wi' a halfling who'd fled the High Moor.~
@42057 = ~Yeah it's a problem. I'll let it go this time. Don't let it happen again.~
@42058 = ~Well met, my friend. And how does this <DAYNIGHTALL> find you?~
@42059 = ~Well, thanks.~
@42060 = ~Uneasy.~
@42061 = ~My thoughts are my own. Leave me to them.~

@42063 = ~I'll do what I can, but I'm just one <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@42064 = ~They best prepare for disappointment, then.~
@42065 = ~You make it sound as though I care what others need.~
@42066 = ~You are far more than that. As you well know.~
@42067 = ~Some elevate me, but it is their doing, not mine—I do not seek the praise of others.~
@42068 = ~What's that supposed to mean?~
@42069 = ~Do you wear a hood and frequent the palace chambers in the late hours? These questions remind me of another...~
@42070 = ~You are more than a simple adventurer now; you have become a symbol. People cheer your name and look to you for hope. 'Tis a great responsibility—a greater burden than I'd ever want to bear.~
@42071 = ~Be vigilant. I wouldn't want anything to happen to the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@42072 = ~Understandable. Much depends on the success of our mission. Much depends on you.~
@42073 = ~No more than any other loyal servant of Baldur's Gate.~

@42075 = ~As long as the goals of these others align with my own, victory is certain.~
@42076 = ~You are more than a simple adventurer now; you are a symbol. People cheer your name, look to you for hope. 'Tis a great responsibility—a greater burden than I'd ever want to bear.~
@42077 = ~As you wish. Mind you take care of yourself. We wouldn't want anything unfortunate to happen to the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@42078 = ~You had best become comfortable with it. You are more than simply an adventurer now. You have become a symbol. People cheer your name and look to you for hope. 'Tis a great responsibility—a greater burden than I'd ever want to bear.~
@42079 = ~It is as you say.~
@42080 = ~Camp's set, watches too. We've been marching hard, covered a lot of ground, but we've still a ways to go. Everyone could use a rest, yourself included. Tonight might be the last full night's sleep we get; we'll be in crusader territory after we cross the bridge.~ [BD42080]
@42081 = ~We should be able to reach the Trade Way bridge from here in less than a day—after that, we'll be in the crusade's territory.~
@42082 = ~Rest if you want. I'm heading up the road a way. I don't want any surprises before we cross the Winding Water.~
@42083 = ~A full night's sleep? That's a poor reward for a long day's journey.~
@42084 = ~The Flaming Fist can handle more than this. We should keep moving until we reach Dragonspear Castle.~
@42085 = ~Sounds good. Let's go.~
@42086 = ~Mind if I join you? I do better in the city than the woods, but perhaps I can help, and maybe learn a thing or two. Bence can take care of the camp.~
@42087 = ~Yes, join me. I could use someone of your skill at my side.~
@42088 = ~I suppose I could accommodate you. I expect you to hold your own, mind.~
@42089 = ~I need to move swiftly and quietly. You are neither.~
@42090 = ~You keep on believing that, if it makes you feel better.~
@42091 = ~Be careful out there.~

@42093 = ~My people need rest and by the gods they're going to get it. If you want to keep going, we can scout the road ahead, make sure our path to the bridge is clear. Let's go.~

@42095 = ~Caelar nearly killed me and my friend Imoen. That cannot stand.~
@42096 = ~Turning back will only cause Caelar to strike me from behind. I'll face her straight on.~
@42097 = ~From the moment Caelar made a target of me, it was too late.~
@42098 = ~I was going to scout the road ahead for any surprises. Care to join me? Something tells me you've had more experience in the wilds than I have.~
@42099 = ~Most interested. Time spent in your company always rewards.~
@42100 = ~I was about to suggest the same. And someone has to keep you out of trouble.~
@42101 = ~I'll consider it, but I'm not eager to leave camp just yet.~
@42102 = ~I guess she hasn't really left you much in the way of options, has she...~

@42110 = ~Your enthusiasm is contagious, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD42110]
@42111 = ~We allow this Flaming Fist harridan to accompany us? We might as well scream our weakness to the wilds.~ [BD42111]
@42112 = ~A wise move. We do not of a certainty know how far Caelar's crusaders have progressed. It is best we find out before we proceed.~
@42113 = ~Peace, <CHARNAME>. Thou takest an insult where none was intended.~

@42160 = ~Caelar Argent tried to kill me, and now I'm trying to kill her back. Childish, I know, but she started it. I'm <CHARNAME>, by the way.~
@42161 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. The Shining Lady tried to kill me. Obviously, she failed, and will fail a second time when I find her at Dragonspear Castle.~
@42162 = ~Thou preening cockatrice! Die!~ [BD42162]
@42163 = ~We're not here to pick fights with Thayan braggarts, <CHARNAME>. Save the venom for Caelar.~ [BD42163]
@42164 = ~For the love of the gods, save that filth for a chamberpot. You, Odess—Odie—wizard. Do you know where Caelar can be found?~ [BD42164]
@42165 = ~It seems fate has offered you to me. The Shining Lady follows me, and you seek to kill her. Our interests align—and should you fail, well, no harm is done, and I am as I was. ~
@42166 = ~Caelar's chasing you? She's near here?~
@42167 = ~I've no interest in working with you.~
@42168 = ~If you seek her head, then join me—we shall end her together.~
@42169 = ~Perhaps, perhaps not. You'll not live to see it, you swarthy knuckledragger!~
@42170 = ~She is coiled, like a serpent waiting for prey, barely a day's journey from us.~
@42171 = ~Join me, Edwin. We've much to discuss.~
@42172 = ~Now this I've GOT to see. Thanks for the information, Edwin.~
@42173 = ~That is all I need. Let us part ways—with great haste.~
@42174 = ~Did he just say Caelar?~
@42175 = ~What do you know about Caelar? Who told you about her?~
@42176 = ~Told us about what, exactly?~
@42177 = ~We are part of a larger force marching north to end Caelar's crusade. As for their leader—do you know where I can find her?~
@42178 = ~The Shining Lady tried to kill me. Now it is my turn.~
@42179 = ~Caelar, you addlepated sack of stirge droppings! What do you know of Caelar? ~
@42180 = ~I travel north to put an end to her crusade. And you?~
@42181 = ~She tried to kill me, and now I'm trying to kill her back. It's kind of childish, really, but she started it.~
@42182 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. I know not why, but the Shining Lady has targeted me for death. She will pay a heavy price for that error.~
@42183 = ~Hmmm. You go to face the Shining Lady, eh? Perhaps I shall join you.~
@42184 = ~We have a mutual enemy. She has no chance against the two of us.~
@42185 = ~If it's company you seek, you can stay at the Flaming Fist camp. I'll find you there if need be. Now begone.~
@42186 = ~Caelar? What?~
@42187 = ~Very well. I shall accompany you (for now, at least).~ [BD42187]
@42188 = ~You too? The gleaming witch has dogged my heels since I left Dragonspear Castle.~
@42189 = ~She would see thee dead? Perhaps she's not the villain we believed.~ [BD42189]
@42190 = ~You will regret this decision. (And when you come crawling back to me, begging Odesseiron to save you, I shall look down and whisper... no.)~ [BD42190]
@42191 = ~So you say. SO YOU SAY. That aside, we seem to have a common goal.~
@42192 = ~You want my respect, you can earn it, same as everyone else. We're part of a Flaming Fist caravan headed to Dragonspear to take on Caelar's crusade. What are you doing here?~
@42193 = ~What do I want? What do I WANT?! Will you listen to yourself, you screeching— (No, no, calm yourself, Odesseiron. Play nice and these ridiculous halfwits may provide you some protection from Caelar...)~
@42194 = ~Fool that you are! Feel the power of the Red Wizards unleashed!~ [BD42194]
@42195 = ~I shall follow you. (For the moment, at least.)~ [BD42195]
@42196 = ~You dismiss me as you would some moon-faced servant boy? Pray to whatever gods you worship we do not cross paths again.~ [BD42196]
@42197 = ~What? What is it you want now? (It had best be worth my time, or there will be hells to pay...)~ [BD42197]
@42198 = ~I would speak with you, Master... Odesseiron, is it not?~
@42199 = ~It certainly isn't worth my time. Farewell, Odesseiron.~
@42200 = ~I want nothing from you, you gibbering jackal.~
@42201 = ~It is and you know it is. Now speak! ~
@42202 = ~I would know what you know of the Shining Lady.~
@42203 = ~I really just wanted to make sure I had your name correct. Thank you.~
@42204 = ~When I first saw you, you were heading away from where I seek to go—away from Caelar. Tell me, have you heard anything of her that might be useful to me?~
@42205 = ~Caelar? That glittering serpent? A curse upon her, and a curse upon the hedge magic of her lackey Hephernaan!~
@42206 = ~You've met her?~
@42207 = ~Hepher-who?~
@42208 = ~Tell me more of this Hephernaan.~
@42209 = ~I'll not speak of that treacherous witch. Just know that she is the worst of deceivers, and can under no circumstances be trusted.~ [BD42209]
@42210 = ~The "Revered Brother" Hephernaan. A wolf in a robe, but he smiles and nods well enough, and such gestures seem to please Caelar.~
@42211 = ~Fare as you will. It matters not.~ [BD42211]
@42212 = ~Talk like that tells me you want a ball of fire thrown in your face. But Edwin Odesseiron flings nothing without careful consideration—fireballs included.~
@42213 = ~Are you trying to vex me? If so, you will have to try harder than that. (But not much harder. Keep pushing...)~ [BD42213]
@42214 = ~Let us be away from here, <CHARNAME>. The stench of Thay is unbearable.~ [BD42214]
@42215 = ~Peace, mage. We've enough enemies to face without adding to the list.~ [BD42215]
@42216 = ~Hephernaan. I have heard this name spoken by many who took refuge in the halls of the Iron Throne.~ [BD42216]
@42217 = ~Tell us what you know, wizard.~ [BD42217]
@42218 = ~And why would I do that? Where is the benefit in this for me?~
@42219 = ~I'll make it worth your while. Join me.~
@42220 = ~Are you such a fool as to refuse help when your life is at stake?~
@42221 = ~The benefit lies in keeping Caelar's hand from your throat for now and ever.~
@42222 = ~Boo does not like the way the Thayan smiles. Or smells. Or looks. Actually, there is little about the Thayan Boo likes, other than the fact that someday, he will die.~ [BD42222]
@42223 = ~The barbarian seeks to provoke me. Yet his words fall short, for Edwin Odesseiron will not deign to hear his chattering semblance of words that pass for insult. I shall join you, <CHARNAME>, although I would counsel you to tighten your ape's leash.~
@42224 = ~I believe I shall join you, if only to show this scum how a gentleman of Thay comports himself.~
@42225 = ~Boo knows that Caelar is the greater threat though, surely?~
@42226 = ~Boo does...~
@42227 = ~Good. Now tell us what you know of the Shining Lady.~
@42228 = ~I know far more than you, yet only this will I share—learn deference before speaking to me again. Now begone before I lose what little patience I have left.~ [BD42228]
@42229 = ~The damnable witch seeks to build an army, one that will bow to her seeming god-spawned words. She is determined, and once she sets her course, nothing deters her. Yet it is her mind that is her own worst enemy—for she deceives herself as she deceives others.~
@42230 = ~That is all I will say regarding the witch. Begone.~ [BD42230]
@42231 = ~I would speak with you. It is a matter of import and cannot wait. It concerns Caelar and her... betrayal. When first we spoke of her, I let anger twist my words.~ [BD42231]
@42232 = ~Can it wait, Edwin? I have much on my mind at the moment.~
@42233 = ~You've changed your mind about confronting her?~
@42234 = ~How exactly did she betray you?~
@42235 = ~Cling to that fury, Edwin. Cultivate your rage. It will serve us well when we face the Shining Lady.~
@42236 = ~This is not something I care to discuss.~
@42237 = ~The betrayal... was not hers. She acted as her nature demanded. The truth of the story begins with three other Red Wizards—Rowena, Ahdzekharrin, and Vichand.~
@42238 = ~We should give careful consideration to our course. Caelar's power is great, and it grows with every passing hour.~
@42239 = ~That's all the more reason to confront her at the earliest possible opportunity.~
@42240 = ~I really don't have time for this right now, Edwin.~
@42241 = ~You would have us turn back? Flee to Baldur's Gate with our tails between our legs?~
@42242 = ~Some weeks past, we received word that Caelar Argent sought magicians to bolster her crusade. We had little interest in the patchwork theology she espouses, but she was willing to pay handsomely for our talents.~
@42243 = ~We journeyed to Dragonspear and met the Shining Lady, experiencing her fabled charisma firsthand. Vichand and Ahdzekharrin joined her on the spot.~
@42244 = ~I and Rowena were not so easily cowed. When Rowena refused to kneel before Caelar without appropriate expiation for such an indignity, she was killed by one of her lieutenants.~
@42245 = ~You stood up for your friend, I assume? You avenged her?~
@42246 = ~And you ran like a beaten dog.~
@42247 = ~You seek to avenge your fallen friend.~
@42248 = ~Eh, not precisely...~
@42249 = ~Beaten dogs cower, stay. A wise beast feigns allegiance when the enemy's sword is at their throat, then leaves when the enemy's gaze is turned.~
@42250 = ~Thank you for telling me your story, my friend.~
@42251 = ~When challenged, you chose the coward's road. I am not surprised.~
@42252 = ~A wise man keeps his head and chooses to fight another day.~
@42253 = ~It would be more accurate to say I knelt before the witch, then fled Dragonspear at the earliest opportunity.~
@42254 = ~Thank you for telling me your story, my friend.~
@42255 = ~You ran like a whipped dog, is what you're saying.~
@42256 = ~You may be a coward, Odesseiron—but you're no fool.~
@42257 = ~What—? I mean—yes, of course I would see Rowena avenged. Do not question the honor of Odesseiron.~
@42258 = ~The Thayan people are masters of survival. Red Wizards doubly so. But what we do now runs counter to that primal instinct.~
@42259 = ~I have told it to you for a reason. We Thayans gauge our enemy, test their strength, retreating if need be, but always, always we are ready to strike.~
@42260 = ~Few know anger as I do, <CHARNAME>. Yet it makes fools of those who bend to it.~
@42261 = ~As Alveus Malcanter said, "The wise general does not lead from the front of the army." Think on it.~ [BD42261]
@42262 = ~Think on it. That is all I ask—for now.~
@42263 = ~Indeed. But you need not be the hammer that falls, only the one holding it—be mindful of not making the most valuable piece the most vulnerable, and while I am loathe to admit it, you are the strongest piece we have on this game board.~ [BD42263]
@42264 = ~It can wait. But not for long.~ [BD42264]
@42265 = ~Four Red Wizards? Ugh, I can barely tolerate the one.~ [BD42265]
@42266 = ~Thou hast more patience for them than I.~
@42267 = ~I barely know the wizard, yet even I know better than to assume such a thing.~ [BD42267]
@42268 = ~I do not think vengeance drives the Red Wizard. Not when it comes at the expense of his own survival.~ [BD42268]
@42269 = ~I find it hard to imagine our friend running anywhere. A brisk walk or a light jog, perhaps.~ [BD42269]
@42270 = ~Thou invite this snake to join us, <CHARNAME>? Hast thou taken leave of thy senses?~ [BD42270]
@42271 = ~Quite the opposite. The wise seek to curry the favor of the powerful.~ [BD42271]
@42272 = ~The wise avoid the scorpion, and so it should be with thee.~ [BD42272]
@42273 = ~The wise had best mind their tongue, or it'll be torn from their filthy mouths! Who is this Rashemi scum? I'll not tolerate her presence!~
@42274 = ~And I'll not tolerate yours, Edwin. Calm yourself, but do it elsewhere—the camp if you must.~
@42275 = ~Edwin's staying with me. Anyone who has a problem with that can wait for me back at the camp.~
@42276 = ~You cast the noble Edwin Odesseiron aside for this... this WITCH? So be it. When your senses return, you shall find me in your camp, enjoying more civilized company.~ [BD42276]
@42277 = ~Why did you invite a Thayan jackal to our circle? They bite when one's back is turned and then yelp and flee to avoid a petting from my boot!~ [BD42277]
@42278 = ~It that is thy wish, it shall be respected. Fare thee well—and watch thy back.~ [BD42278]
@42279 = ~Thayans! Ptoo! Boo says those who lay with dogs get fleas.~ [BD42279]
@42280 = ~And what do those who lay with rodents get, I wonder?~ [BD42280]
@42281 = ~Wisdom! And some fleas.~ [BD42281]
@42282 = ~Hm. I suppose a rodent would have some wisdom to share with a Rashemi savage.~
@42283 = ~Silence, you two. We've enough to worry about without fighting amongst ourselves. Edwin, leave us.~
@42284 = ~Anyone who has a problem with Edwin can wait back at camp.~
@42285 = ~You cast the noble Edwin Odesseiron aside for this... this... THIS? So be it. When your senses return, you shall find me in your camp, enjoying more civilized company.~ [BD42285]
@42286 = ~A frog can sooner trust a scorpion than a hero any son of Thay. But I shall do as you say, <CHARNAME>. Farewell.~ [BD42286]
@42287 = ~What is this? You cannot seriously ask a Thayan of my rank, a Red Wizard of the highest order, to work alongside Rashemi scum!~ [BD42287]
@42288 = ~Neither do I. Leave us, Edwin, and head to the camp.~
@42289 = ~Forgive me, Dynaheir. We need all the help we can get to face what lies ahead. ~
@42290 = ~Forgive me, Minsc... and Boo. We need all the help we can get to face what lies ahead.~
@42291 = ~Forgive me, Dynaheir, Minsc... and Boo. We need all the help we can get to face what lies ahead.~
@42292 = ~I am giving the orders. If you won't follow them, then leave and fend for yourself. ~
@42293 = ~You cast Edwin Odesseiron aside for this... this WITCH? So be it. When your senses return, you shall find me at the camp, enjoying more civilized company.~ [BD42293]
@42294 = ~I shall return to the camp... but I say (and Boo agrees) you are making a mistake. Farewell.~ [BD42294]
@42295 = ~I... shall respect thy wish. When thy senses return, seek me at the camp. Until then—watch thy back.~ [BD42295]
@42296 = ~Ready to head out? ~
@42297 = ~I am.~
@42298 = ~Soon.~
@42299 = ~Good. Let's go.~
@42300 = ~Make it sooner than that. We don't have time to waste.~
@42301 = ~The word on the road is that Caelar's followers have taken Boareskyr Bridge and surrounded Bridgefort. We'll not cross the Winding Water until they're dealt with.~ [BD42301]
@42302 = ~The watches have been set and scouts deployed, Corporal? The last thing we need is a band of trolls catching us unawares.~ [BD42302]
@42303 = ~Trolls we can handle. It's the crusade that worries me. We should make contact with those in Bridgefort—if there are any left.~ [BD42303]
@42304 = ~I'll scout to the north. Perhaps I can find a way to reach the fort's defenders.~
@42305 = ~I'd rather investigate the crusader camp and evaluate our enemy.~
@42306 = ~We should be pressing on instead of making camp.~
@42307 = ~Failing that, just kill as many crusaders as you can, but take care that you come back alive. We need you.~ [BD42307]
@42308 = ~Be prudent in your ranging. One of our scouts stumbled onto a troll cave to the northwest—she barely made it back alive.~ [BD42308]
@42309 = ~Getting eyes on the crusade can only help us. Don't engage the enemy if you can help it. And do NOT let them know who you are—unless you want a hundred zealots lining up to kill you.~ [BD42309]
@42310 = ~Whatever you do, be careful. The crusade seems satisfied to hold the bridge and keep the fort isolated for the moment, but that might not last. You don't want to be caught off-guard if they start moving again.~
@42311 = ~We rode day and night from the Coast Way to here. If we're going to face the crusade, we don't want to do it half dead from lack of sleep.~ [BD42311]
@42312 = ~Baldur's Gate has enough martyrs. I'll not give it more sending exhausted soldiers against the enemy.~ [BD42312]
@42313 = ~Prepare to be meeting your end, puppet of Caelar!~
@42314 = ~Hold, Voghiln! They do not wear crusade colors.~
@42315 = ~Oh. Ja, you are right. Who are you, stranger?~
@42316 = ~I am <CHARNAME> of Baldur's Gate, come to fight Caelar's crusade.~
@42317 = ~Jaheira? Is that you?~
@42318 = ~Be you friend or crusader?~
@42319 = ~<CHARNAME>? You're supposed to be in Baldur's Gate. What are you doing here?~
@42320 = ~Marching to Dragonspear to fight against Caelar and her crusade. And you?~
@42321 = ~How did you come to be here without Khalid?~
@42322 = ~I might ask the same question. Who are you?~
@42323 = ~When you put an end to the iron crisis, Khalid and I decided to travel to Bridgefort, thinking it would make for a pleasant respite from Baldur's Gate. And it was—until the crusade took Boareskyr Bridge. I was trapped outside Bridgefort, Khalid within.~
@42324 = ~Join me, Jaheira. Together, we shall liberate Bridgefort and reunite you with your husband.~
@42325 = ~So you and these others stand against the crusade. Doesn't seem like a fair fight.~
@42326 = ~You haven't made an impressive showing here thus far.~
@42327 = ~They are many. We are few. ~
@42328 = ~A thousand ill-trained crusaders are no match for us—and the troops accompanying me. They are camped southwest of here; join them and await my return.~
@42329 = ~You're at least one more now. Join me.~
@42330 = ~I will thin the crusade's ranks. Head southwest to the Flaming Fist camp; I shall meet you there.~
@42331 = ~I promised Gorion I would keep you safe. I gave him my word. This is not a safe place. ~
@42332 = ~Join me, then. Watch over me as best you can. I'll not leave until the crusade has been driven back across Boareskyr.~
@42333 = ~There's no safe place for me, not while Caelar lives. She sent assassins into the Ducal Palace. They nearly killed me and Imoen.~
@42334 = ~Gorion is dead. If Caelar isn't eliminated, I will join him sooner than later. If you believe I'll stand idly by and wait for it to happen, you know nothing of me. Now do as I say and get thee to the camp.~
@42335 = ~This is true. Very well.~
@42336 = ~So the gentle Jaheira will go at this <PRO_MANWOMAN>'s side? And, ah, what shall Voghiln do in the meantime?~
@42337 = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>. This is Voghiln of Luskan. A bit too-lusty, but a worthy fighter. We would have been taken by the crusade were it not for him.~
@42338 = ~Come with me, Voghiln. Any friend of Jaheira's is a friend of mine.~
@42339 = ~He and your other followers will find refuge in the camp to the southwest.~
@42340 = ~Join me, Voghiln. A Luskan warrior is a desirable thing to have, in combat.~
@42341 = ~I would not call him friend, but he is useful.~
@42342 = ~I will be more than just a friend to the beautiful Jaheira, ere this is over, ho ho! Now! Let us go beard the lion in its den, ya?~
@42343 = ~As best we can, given our numbers.~
@42344 = ~Before you range too far, you should know, the crusade holds Boareskyr Bridge and you'll not be allowed into Bridgefort, at least not through the front. But there may be another way...~
@42345 = ~This camp you speak of, does it welcome all who would battle the crusade? And can wine be found within it?~ [BD42345]
@42346 = ~Good! We will see you again soon, ja?~ [BD42346]
@42347 = ~I was visiting Bridgefort with my husband, Khalid, when the crusade attacked. He was trapped within, I without. I have spent the weeks since trying to find a way to reunite with Khalid.~
@42348 = ~Join me, Jaheira. Together, we shall liberate Bridgefort and reunite you with Khalid.~
@42349 = ~Reinforcements have arrived. The Flaming Fist are camped just down the path—join them. We can speak when I return.~
@42350 = ~To no avail, I take it?~
@42351 = ~As best we can, given our numbers. They are many. We are few. ~
@42352 = ~I've not come alone, there are more than two score Flaming Fist mercenaries just down the path. Join us, and we will see this siege ended.~
@42353 = ~You're a few more now. Come, show me what there is to see of the Shining Lady's army.~
@42354 = ~They will be fewer still before this is over. There's a Flaming Fist encampment back down the path. Go there and wait for me to return.~
@42355 = ~Very well.~
@42356 = ~Imoen is here?~
@42357 = ~No. She remains in Baldur's Gate, hopefully beyond Caelar's reach.~
@42358 = ~No. She... decided not to take part in this venture.~
@42359 = ~Unfortunately, she is not.~
@42360 = ~Then you need me now more than ever. I shall join you.~
@42361 = ~Ho ho, <PRO_HESHE> asks if we are crusaders! Fighting words, those.~
@42362 = ~We are not looking for trouble—but we are ready to deal with it, if necessary.~
@42363 = ~Nor will I, now or ever.~
@42364 = ~You would have this ragged beast join us? I thought you a man of better taste.~
@42365 = ~You have not seen a looking glass in some time, or you would hold your tongue.~
@42366 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. It is I, Minsc. Do you not remember?~
@42367 = ~I don't think <PRO_HESHE>'s talking to you, big boy.~
@42368 = ~Yes. Show us their butts, that we may proceed with the kicking of them.~
@42369 = ~You mention the Flaming Fist down the path but do not introduce those who stand beside you. Interesting.~
@42370 = ~I will join you, <CHARNAME>, if that is your wish.~
@42371 = ~She'll be safe. The dukes will not allow what happened to repeat itself.~
@42372 = ~You can hardly blame her for that. She had a poison dagger shoved in her side.~
@42373 = ~You need no Imoen. You have me.~
@42374 = ~Jaheira, my love! It's been days since your last message. I was afraid—~
@42375 = ~You are not rid of me so easily as that, Khalid.~
@42376 = ~And you will not ever be rid of me. I swear it.~
@42377 = ~I'll let you have some privacy. There's a Flaming Fist camp not far from here. I'll see you there when I return.~
@42378 = ~Save the welcome for later—come on, we have work to do. ~
@42379 = ~I beg to differ.~
@42380 = ~It has been days since I last saw my husband, <CHARNAME>. I'll not be apart from him again so soon.~
@42381 = ~I understand. You two go get reacquainted. There's a Flaming Fist camp not far from here. I'll see you there when I return.~
@42382 = ~He'll need to come with us, then. Business before pleasure.~
@42383 = ~I've not seen Jaheira for days, <CHARNAME>. You c-cannot mean to break us apart again.~
@42384 = ~Forgive me, Khalid. Of course you and Jaheira should be together now. There's a Flaming Fist camp not far from here. I'll see you there when I return.~
@42385 = ~If you'll depart from Jaheira, then we'll have to bring her along.~
@42386 = ~I care not where I go, so long as I-I-I am with my beloved.~
@42387 = ~Take care of yourself, <CHARNAME>. We'll talk again soon, I'm sure.~
@42388 = ~We'll g-go there now. Farewell.~
@42389 = ~Excellent. Then it is decided.~
@42390 = ~It's over! The Battle of Bridgefort has been won!~
@42391 = ~I'll give credit where it's due. You did well here today, <CHARNAME>. It was a bloody business that would have been bloodier still were it not for you.~ [BD42391]
@42392 = ~It was nicely done, but there's still work to do.~
@42393 = ~I'll have the camp struck. We'll make for Dragonspear as soon as you're ready.~ [BD42393]
@42394 = ~Jaheira, my love! It's been days since your last message. I was afraid—~
@42395 = ~You doubted you would see me again, Khalid? You do not get rid of me so easily as that.~
@42396 = ~And you will not ever be rid of me. I swear it.~
@42397 = ~We owe our reunion to you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you.~
@42398 = ~I'm happy to have brought you and Khalid together again, Jaheira. But Caelar is far from defeated. Would you help me end her crusade?~
@42399 = ~You know my name, but I don't know yours. I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage.~
@42400 = ~You have nothing to thank me for. I did what I did for myself, not for you.~
@42401 = ~Well, you have our thanks for it. If there's anything we can ever do for you, let us know.~
@42402 = ~I may take you up on that. Go to the Flaming Fist camp down the road. I'll see you there shortly.~
@42403 = ~I'll do that. I don't believe I caught your name...?~
@42404 = ~An unlikely scenario, but I suppose it is possible.~
@42405 = ~We came here seeking answers to the questions surrounding the Shining Lady, and have found few thus far. Of course we shall join you.~
@42406 = ~I am Jaheira, and this is my husband, Khalid. We came here at the bidding of some... friends... to find out what we might about Caelar's crusade. We were separated when Caelar's forces attacked Bridgefort. Surely Gorion told you about us?~
@42407 = ~It gives me joy to know I had a hand in reuniting you. But Caelar remains a threat. Will you help me end her crusade?~
@42408 = ~True love cannot be thwarted. I'll leave you two to get reacquainted.~
@42409 = ~If you've a mind to avenge that disrespect, you may join the Flaming Fist caravan I'm a part of. We will set off to face Caelar herself at Dragonspear Castle in short order, I expect.~
@42410 = ~We will do that. There is m-much the Shining Lady and her crusade must answer for.~
@42411 = ~Corporal Duncan tells me the Flaming Fist goes to Dragonspear to face Caelar. Khalid and I have an interest in the Shining Lady. We will join them in their trek. Thank you again, <CHARNAME>. We are in your debt.~
@42412 = ~Ex-excellent. Should you have n-need of us, you will find us there. Farewell, a-a-and thanks again.~
@42413 = ~Look, all. The champion of Baldur's Gate—nay, the champion of Bridgefort, is here! ~
@42414 = ~Ah, the hero of Baldur's Gate—and the hero of Bridgefort! Share a drink with me!~ [BD42414]
@42415 = ~In time, my friend. For now I'd like you to join me in my travels.~
@42416 = ~Forgive me, my friend, I don't believe I know your name.~
@42417 = ~I know we've met, but I know little about you.~
@42418 = ~I'd put down that flask and be on your guard. ~
@42419 = ~Ah, the hero of Baldur's Gate! Share a drink with me!~ [BD42419]
@42420 = ~In time, my friend. For now I'd like you to join me in my travels.~
@42421 = ~Forgive me, my friend, I don't believe I know your name.~
@42422 = ~I know we've met, but I know little about you.~
@42423 = ~There are other matters I must attend to—as should you. ~
@42424 = ~You have the pleasure of speaking with Mighty Voghiln, slayer of the Nightmare Clan, pride of the Ten Towns!~ [BD42424]
@42425 = ~Well met, Voghiln of the Ten Towns. I seek to vanquish Caelar Argent. Would you join me?~
@42426 = ~Perhaps you would seek to add Dragonspear to your exploits? Caelar and her crusade await.~
@42427 = ~We clearly take pleasure from very different things. I'll leave you to your revelry.~
@42428 = ~Ho ho! You are a scholar, but judging by what remains of the crusade, you are no gentle man.~
@42429 = ~Voghiln loves a good fight, and you seem to have enough of those. Ja! I will join you... once I finish my drink.~ [BD42429]
@42430 = ~To travel with such a beautiful woman would please Voghiln greatly. First, a toast to you. Then we shall march against the crusade!~ [BD42430]
@42431 = ~It is your loss. But not for long, for I travel to Dragonspear with the Flaming Fist. We will drink together at the camp, ja? Ja!~ [BD42431]
@42432 = ~Ah! You are a woman after mine own heart. Introductions! You are <CHARNAME>, of course, but who am I? Well, I shall tell you.~
@42433 = ~Farewell, friend.~ [BD42433]
@42434 = ~I know this man, <CHARNAME>, and can tell you that for all his many... MANY faults, he is a good and valiant warrior. I'd introduce you, but he's a skald—he takes such joy in speaking of himself I would not rob him of the chance.~
@42435 = ~Y-y-you say you know this man? How w-well do you know him?~
@42436 = ~Not as well as I'd have liked her to. You are Khalid, ja? Fear not, mine friend—fair Jaheira's honor was a barrier I could not penetrate.~ [BD42436]
@42437 = ~I d-don't find that part-particularly comforting. Who are, are you again?~
@42438 = ~Yes, I heard you! Now shut up, please.~
@42439 = ~SHUT UP.~
@42440 = ~Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, SHUT UUUUUUP.~
@42441 = ~WHAT? Uh, I mean—hello! Hi!~ [BD36431]
@42442 = ~Wait a second. I know that voice—NO, NOT YOURS, THE NEW ONE—yours.~ [BD42442]
@42443 = ~You don't remember me? <CHARNAME>? I helped you find that wild mage you were looking for...?~
@42444 = ~Do I know you?~
@42445 = ~Should I be flattered? I am <CHARNAME>. And who do I have the pleasure of being recognized by?~
@42446 = ~I don't believe you do. Nor will you start now.~
@42447 = ~Adoy. Don't say his name. I realize you didn't say his name; I said it. I wish I hadn't said it, and you definitely shouldn't say it.~ [BD36440]
@42448 = ~Be quiet! I'm tryin' to talk to my friend here. Where was I? Oh, right. Adoy. He's been haunting me. Can you be haunted by someone who isn't dead? Well, if you can't, he's doing what would be called haunting if he were dead.~ [BD36441]
@42449 = ~Neera. I'm a magician. Be quiet, Adoy! I'm trying to talk here... <CHARNAME>—can you be haunted by someone who isn't dead? I know you can be hunted by someone who isn't a hunter, but...~ [BD36442]
@42450 = ~Well, if you can't, he's doing what would be called haunting if he were dead.~
@42451 = ~Yes, we're talking about you, and you aren't making it easy, so just be quiet. BE QUIET! ...You can't hear him, can you, <CHARNAME>?~ [BD36447]
@42452 = ~No. ~
@42453 = ~Yes, you know me! Neera, remember?~ [BD36449]
@42454 = ~Neera, I could use your help, if you're willing to join me?~
@42455 = ~Oh, right. The wild mage. I helped you find another you thought could help you...~
@42456 = ~Right, right. You're a wild mage too. We were looking for another you thought could help you.~
@42457 = ~I don't. But come with me anyway; it might help me remember.~
@42458 = ~No. And I don't think I'm about to start.~
@42459 = ~Honestly? That is so, so great! ~
@42460 = ~There is a Flaming Fist camp not far from here. You'll find it a little more comfortable than this cell—but only a little. Wait for me there.~
@42461 = ~I may have need of you in the coming days. Await me at the Flaming Fist camp down the road.~
@42462 = ~I can do that.~
@42463 = ~Yeah, all right.~
@42464 = ~I can do that. Be quiet! I'm trying to talk to <CHARNAME> here. Where was I?~
@42465 = ~I'm not sure. Who are you talking to?~
@42466 = ~You were in Bridgefort, but the battle's over. You are free.~
@42467 = ~Adoy. He's been haunting me. Can you be haunted by someone who isn't dead? Well, if you can't, he's doing what would be called haunting if he were dead.~
@42468 = ~Wow. You've only been here a minute and you're already less pleasant than Adoy, which I didn't think was possible. Don't let it go to your head, Adoy; you're still unbearable too. But at least I can ask this one to go away. YOU—go away.~ [BD42468]
@42469 = ~There is a Flaming Fist camp not far from here. You should find it more comfortable than this cell, if only a little. Wait for me there until I return.~
@42470 = ~I may have need of you in the coming days. Await me at the Flaming Fist camp down the road.~
@42471 = ~I'm trying to get the ingredients for a—hey, I'm trying to TALK here—for a potion that'll SHUT HIM THE HELLS UP.~ [BD36470]
@42472 = ~What do you need?~
@42473 = ~I'll not add my voice to the ones vying for your attention. There is a Flaming Fist camp not far from here. Perhaps someone there can help you.~
@42474 = ~Yeah, all right. Nowhere to go but up, right? YES, I KNOW, ADOY, IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH. SHEESH!~
@42475 = ~Let's see. Dead water from beneath Boareskyr Bridge, got that already. The leg of a seven-legged spider.~ [BD36474]
@42476 = ~I've no idea where you could find one of those.~
@42477 = ~I do have the leg of such a spider. I don't know why I've got it, exactly, but I do. Take it, please. You'll be doing me a favor.~
@42478 = ~I came upon a giant spider nest not far from here. We might be able to find a suitable leg there.~
@42479 = ~Ho ho. Mighty Voghiln might know where you can find such a spider. It's not far from here.~ [BD36478]
@42480 = ~Honestly? That is so, so great!~ [BD36479]
@42481 = ~I also need a feather from a planetar's wing, some belladonna, a potion of perception, and the juice of one turnip.~ [BD36482]
@42482 = ~I have a planetar feather.~
@42483 = ~I've found a potion of perception.~
@42484 = ~I can get you the feather and the potion of perception.~
@42485 = ~I can get the feather and the potion. Come with me and I'll help you find the others too.~
@42486 = ~I have the feather and the potion—they're yours if you need them.~
@42487 = ~I don't have any of those things, but stick with me and we'll find them, I promise.~
@42488 = ~I have none of those things. But I'll keep an eye out for them.~
@42489 = ~Really? All right. I'm with you.~ [BD36490]
@42490 = ~I hope this isn't too forward, but I think I may be in love with you.~ [BD36491]
@42491 = ~Stick with me and we'll find the rest of the ingredients. I promise.~
@42492 = ~Stick with me and we'll find all the ingredients you need. I promise.~
@42493 = ~Come on. We've things to do.~
@42494 = ~There is a Flaming Fist camp not far from here. Perhaps you'll be able to find some of the other ingredients there.~
@42495 = ~And you're just going to hand it over to the elf, aren't you? You make me sad, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD36496]
@42496 = ~I'm a half-elf, lady. And I've got more than enough grating voices in my head right now, so I'll thank you for not adding yours to the din.~ [BD36497]
@42497 = ~You'll give me the potion, <CHARNAME>?~ [BD36498]
@42498 = ~Stick with me and we'll find all the ingredients you need. I promise.~
@42499 = ~Of course.~
@42500 = ~For 100 gold pieces, I will.~
@42501 = ~Done. Hand it over. ~
@42502 = ~I need them. They're my best chance of getting Adoy out of my head—OH YES, I WILL GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD! IT'S COMING, BELIEVE YOU ME!~ [BD42502]
@42503 = ~The feather and potion, here, take them. Come with me and I'll help you find the other ingredients as well.~
@42504 = ~Here are the feather and the potion. There is a Flaming Fist camp not far from here. Perhaps you'll be able to find some of the other ingredients there.~
@42505 = ~Ah, I knew it was a long shot. Thanks.~ [BD36506]
@42506 = ~There is a Flaming Fist camp not far from here—a little more comfortable than this cell, but not by much. Wait for me there until I return.~
@42507 = ~I may have need of you in the coming days. Await me at the Flaming Fist camp down the road.~
@42508 = ~Release me from this cage, worms! Release me and face my wrath!~ [BD42508]
@42509 = ~Dorn Il-Khan. I never thought I'd see you caged.~
@42510 = ~Who in their right mind would choose to face the wrath of the mighty Dorn Il-Khan?~
@42511 = ~Name yourself, half-orc. Tell me how you came to be caged by the crusade.~
@42512 = ~You are in no position to make demands.~
@42513 = ~I am Dorn of the clan Il-Khan. Release me!~ [BD42513]
@42514 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate. Give me one good reason why I should let you out of that cage.~
@42515 = ~Perhaps I will—after you tell me how you came to be in that cage to begin with.~
@42516 = ~I will release you, Dorn Il-Khan, you're clearly no friend to the Shining Lady.~
@42517 = ~I sought to kill the priest Hormorn—one of Caelar's inner circle of advisors. I failed to anticipate the Barghest's interference.~ [BD42517]
@42518 = ~You'll not hear from the Barghest again, but there are plenty more where he came from. Join me. Together, <CHARNAME> and Dorn Il-Khan will bring Caelar to her knees.~
@42519 = ~Go with these mercenaries, Dorn Il-Khan. They'll take you to our camp.~
@42520 = ~Open the half-orc's cage. Take him back to the camp. He will join us on our journey to Dragonspear.~
@42521 = ~<CHARNAME>. So you are behind the crusade's troubles. Well done. I had hoped to do much the same myself.~ [BD42521]
@42522 = ~The crusade is a fool's quest. All who flock to the Shining Lady's banner are blinded by a false light. And the blind are easy to kill—or so I believed.~ [BD42522]
@42523 = ~I am with you. Hormorn is beyond my reach now, but I will see more crusader blood shed ere I am done.~ [BD42523]
@42524 = ~Are you sure that's a good idea...?~
@42525 = ~Do as they say, little man. You have nothing to fear from me. I hunt bigger prey than you.~ [BD42525]
@42526 = ~I shall await you in this camp you speak of. Fare thee well until then.~ [BD42526]
@42527 = ~I'm pretty sure it's a bad one. But bad ideas are my favorite kind...~ [BD42527]
@42528 = ~What does it matter? This one reeks of blood and treachery. He is where he belongs.~ [BD42528]
@42529 = ~You wound me, dear lady. I seek the crusade's destruction, as you must, or you would not be here now. We should be working together. As to how I found myself here...~ [BD42529]
@42530 = ~No one at all. Minsc stands ready!~ [BD42530]
@42531 = ~A cage is the proper place for one such as this.~
@42532 = ~You know nothing of me, woman. You would not stand where you are if we didn't share the same goals.~ [BD42532]
@42533 = ~It might be best to leave the half-orc where he is. The crusaders could have had good reason to cage him.~ [BD42533]
@42534 = ~Huzzah!~
@42535 = ~Cheers for the hero!~
@42536 = ~The hero! The hero!~
@42537 = ~Thank you for everything you did for us.~
@42538 = ~I dub thee the hero of Bridgefort!~
@42539 = ~Bridgefort still stands! The crusade will be broken!~
@42540 = ~Death to Caelar and all who serve her!~
@42541 = ~ 'Twas a hard battle, well fought.~
@42542 = ~Good job with the crusade. They don't call you hero for nothing.~
@42543 = ~Next stop, Dragonspear Castle.~
@42544 = ~We've got Caelar on the run now.~
@42545 = ~The Shining Lady doesn't shine so bright anymore.~
@42546 = ~Good work taking care of Bridgefort. Are you ready for Dragonspear?~
@42547 = ~No sleep till Dragonspear! Yeah!~
@42548 = ~Care for a drink, hero? You earned it.~
@42549 = ~Victory for the Flaming Fist! Death to the crusade!~
@42550 = ~Caelar's had her first taste of Flaming Fist knuckle. But not the last.~
@42551 = ~Caelar will rue the day she crossed Baldur's Gate.~
@42552 = ~Halt! Who goes— Oh, it's you again. What do you want? ~
@42553 = ~The same thing I wanted before: to join the Shining Lady's crusade.~
@42554 = ~I bring word from Caelar. Where is the camp commander?~
@42555 = ~From you? Nothing.~
@42556 = ~How bad do you want it? 200 gold pieces bad?~
@42557 = ~I don't have that much gold.~
@42558 = ~You asked for 100 last time.~
@42559 = ~No. Not that bad.~
@42560 = ~Aye, and I bet you're wishing you'd given it to me now. Hand over 200 gold or begone. ~
@42561 = ~Fine. Here.~
@42562 = ~I don't have that much.~
@42563 = ~Look at me. LOOK at me. Not letting me into the camp is a mistake, one I promise you'll regret the rest of your life. Don't make it.~
@42564 = ~Welcome to the crusade.~
@42565 = ~That's a pity. Come back when you do.~
@42566 = ~Be on your way, then.~
@42567 = ~I live in Caelar's light. I have no regrets. Begone.~
@42568 = ~Ho there. Enjoying life in Caelar's service? ~
@42569 = ~Very much so.~
@42570 = ~It's life in an army, and a largely untrained one at that. I won't complain, I've seen worse, but it's not great.~
@42571 = ~Why would I enjoy serving the will of another?~
@42572 = ~It only gets better, you know. I can't wait for what comes next.~
@42573 = ~Give it time. You'll come around.~
@42574 = ~You serve the Shining Lady. There can be no greater honor than that. Give it some time. You'll come around.~
@42575 = ~You there. What are you up to? ~
@42576 = ~Nothing, sir.~
@42577 = ~I've been tasked with delivering a message to one of our people at the gate, sir.~
@42578 = ~I'm looking for a man named Munsch. He's an assistant to General Cordell.~
@42579 = ~That's no business of yours.~
@42580 = ~Idle hands do our enemies' work. You have the look of a seasoned combatant. Go assist Lieutenant Kharm in training those less fortunate than yourselves. I would have them survive the coming trials if possible. ~
@42581 = ~Breaking Bridgefort won't be so big a trial, will it?~
@42582 = ~I'll do what I can for them.~
@42583 = ~They'll need more than I can provide to do that.~
@42584 = ~I speak of what comes after—when we achieve our glorious purpose. ~
@42585 = ~Of course, my lord. Bridgefort is but a small stone in the path we walk to achieve our final goals.~
@42586 = ~Oh, right. Our glorious purpose. Um, what is that again?~
@42587 = ~Caelar will lead us to victory.~
@42588 = ~When the time is right, you will learn. Come to the bonfire tonight for your indoctrination.~
@42589 = ~Well, be about your business, then.~
@42590 = ~LIEUTENANT Cordell. Munsch flatters his commander, and himself in the bargain.~
@42591 = ~Not my business? Tell me, who is your superior officer? I would have words with them about the attitude of their subordinates.~
@42592 = ~Delgar Munsch.~
@42593 = ~I report to Colonel Cordell.~
@42594 = ~The Barghest.~
@42595 = ~I serve Hormorn.~
@42596 = ~I serve Caelar, as do we all.~
@42597 = ~I am honored to serve Lieutenant Kindt.~
@42598 = ~That is true, and none are more devoted to her cause than I. But it is Caelar's will that all in this camp answer to me. When next we meet, be sure to show the proper respect.~
@42599 = ~You don't wear the robes of the Revered.~
@42600 = ~Not all of us do.~
@42601 = ~Hormorn's business took me somewhere the robes would not be welcome.~
@42602 = ~That doesn't alter the fact that I answer to Hormorn.~
@42603 = ~Really? I'll have to speak with the Revered Brother about this...~
@42604 = ~Well said. Be about your business, then.~
@42605 = ~And they will have it. The gods smile upon us. Even so, we have a duty to train those who need it for the task at hand.~
@42606 = ~A general is only as strong as his—or her—soldiers. Go help Kharm.~
@42607 = ~Next time you speak to a superior officer, show them the respect they're due. Now be about your business.~
@42608 = ~There is no Lieutenant Kindt in this camp. Die, heretic!~
@42609 = ~You lie well. But not well enough!~
@42610 = ~I told you to be about your business. ~
@42611 = ~At once, sir.~
@42612 = ~You did tell me to do that, and so I did it.~
@42613 = ~And so I will be, when I choose.~
@42614 = ~If you had done as I said at once, I would not have had to say it twice. Do not make me repeat myself again.~
@42615 = ~This is a place for soldiers, not jesters. Now do as I command.~
@42616 = ~And now you have nothing to do? Here, in a camp laying siege to an enemy fort? I don't believe it.~
@42617 = ~Come on, come on. ~
@42618 = ~Where are we going?~
@42619 = ~If I must.~
@42620 = ~I don't think so.~
@42621 = ~The waiting room.~
@42622 = ~We don't have time to wait, <CHARNAME>. People in Bridgefort are getting sick...~
@42623 = ~I'm afraid you do.~
@42624 = ~Something about the way you say that makes me think you're not the one who should be afraid right now.~
@42625 = ~You're no messenger. Take <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@42626 = ~At last, the time for violence has arrived. Come, crusader! Let Minsc introduce your face to the dirt!~
@42627 = ~Damn it, <CHARNAME>! He believed you! We almost had a clear shot at the Barghest and you threw it away!~
@42628 = ~And here we go again...~
@42629 = ~Munsch! Who've you got with you?~
@42630 = ~A messenger who wants an audience with the Barghest.~
@42631 = ~Then why're you walking <PRO_HIMHER> past the Barghest's tent? I just saw him there.~
@42632 = ~I'm not just takin' 'em to see the Barghest, idiot. I've got this. You just worry about getting your people ready to face the Hells.~
@42633 = ~This is the best chance we'll get to scout the camp, <CHARNAME>. We need to get out of these cages, quickly.~ [BD42633]
@42634 = ~The prisoner's escaped! Get him!~
@42635 = ~I know who you are. I'm a miner from Nashkel. I've never forgotten what you did for our town. If it weren't for you, my family and I might have starved.~
@42636 = ~I'm glad I could help.~
@42637 = ~You recognize me?~
@42638 = ~My actions weren't for your gain.~
@42639 = ~Whatever else might happen, I'd know you anywhere. Not everyone in the camp would, even though I heard they're looking for you. They only got a rough description of you. I won't say a word to the commanders, though. Consider it thanks for what you did for Nashkel.~
@42640 = ~Here, I'll even let you out of the cage. Be careful in camp and don't tell anyone who you really are. They want to capture you bad. Don't know why, and don't want to find out.~
@42641 = ~Thanks again, hero. I'd better get back to my post.~
@42642 = ~Be careful in camp and don't tell anyone who you really are. They want to capture you bad. Don't know why, and don't want to find out.~
@42643 = ~Let us out! Free us, <PRO_RACE>!~
@42644 = ~Open these cages! OPEN!~
@42645 = ~Ignore the trolls. You're nothing but meat to them. I, however, have more to offer—if you release me.~ [BD42645]
@42646 = ~You have nothing to offer me.~
@42647 = ~Dorn Il-Khan. I never thought I'd see you caged. What happened?~
@42648 = ~Who are you? How came you to be a prisoner of the crusade?~
@42649 = ~Don't pretend you're any different. I've seen how you treat your enemies, Dorn Il-Khan.~
@42650 = ~<CHARNAME>. What are you doing here—? No, I don't care. Open the cage. Free me.~ [BD42650]

@42655 = ~I'm afraid I can't do that—not yet. Be patient. I shall return for you when I have done what I need to do.~
@42656 = ~Perhaps I will—after you tell me how you came to be in that cage to begin with.~
@42657 = ~If I do, will you fight the crusade at my side?~
@42658 = ~I don't take orders from half-orcs in cages. Farewell—as well as you can, considering your circumstances.~
@42659 = ~I'll fight by your side, Lathander's side, the side of any who would see crusader blood spilled.~ [BD42659]

@42661 = ~How did you become the crusade's prisoner?~
@42662 = ~<CHARNAME> and Dorn Il-Khan. We'll make a good team, you and I.~
@42663 = ~Those crusaders who survive our onslaught shall tremble at our names.~ [BD42663]
@42664 = ~Hrmm. If you serve Caelar, you would do well to leave me where I am. If you would see her and her peasant flock destroyed, we are allies by virtue of our mutual foe.~ [BD42664]
@42665 = ~I was captured while attempting to slay the Revered Brother Hormorn, priest of Caelar. I did not anticipate the one they call the Barghest interfering with my mission.~ [BD42665]
@42666 = ~You'll not hear from the Barghest again, but there are plenty more where he came from. Join me. Together, <CHARNAME> and Dorn Il-Khan will bring Caelar to her knees.~

@42672 = ~Join me, Dorn Il-Khan. Together, we will crush Caelar and all who serve her.~
@42673 = ~I'm sure he would, were I to release you.~
@42674 = ~Not far to the southeast you'll find a Flaming Fist camp. Tell them <CHARNAME> sent you. They'll take care of you until I return.~
@42675 = ~You freed me from my cage, and that is no small thing. I'll forgive your insolence—this time. When we meet again at this camp you speak of, do not be so imprudent as to try and command me again.~ [BD42675]
@42676 = ~I do the bidding of my patron, Ur-Gothoz. 'Twas he who demanded Hormorn's death. I failed him.~ [BD42676]
@42677 = ~To what end?~
@42678 = ~Well, you're only one half-orc, and it is quite a large crusade. I'm sure he'll forgive you in time. I'm afraid you'll have to stay in the cage for now, but have no fear—I'll return to free you shortly.~
@42679 = ~Join me, and you'll have the chance to redeem yourself in his eyes. We'll shed crusader blood by the barrel.~
@42680 = ~I am Dorn Il-Khan.~ [BD42680]
@42681 = ~I know that name. You speak to the Butcher of Barrow, <CHARNAME>.~

@42684 = ~You'll find a Flaming Fist camp southeast of here. Tell them <CHARNAME> sent you. They'll take care of you until I return.~
@42685 = ~Yeah, that's probably wise. All right, I can't let you out of the cage just yet, but take heart. I'll return to free you soon.~
@42686 = ~Join me, and you'll have the chance to redeem yourself. We'll bathe in crusader blood!~
@42687 = ~Oh yes. Yes, we shall. Look around. I saw two crusaders handling my blade not an hour past—the equipment stolen from me cannot be far from here.~ [BD42687]
@42688 = ~You can be of more assistance yet. The Shining Lady's pawns dared cage me. ME. They must pay.~ [BD42688]

@42690 = ~And that's why I can't let you out of the cage just yet—you'll bring the entire crusade down on my head. Don't despair, though—I'll return to free you soon.~
@42691 = ~Join me, then. We'll make them pay together.~
@42692 = ~What does it matter? This one reeks of blood and treachery. He is where he belongs.~ [BD42692]
@42693 = ~I would sooner be a corpse than a prisoner. As to how I found myself here...~ [BD42693]
@42694 = ~I do not know if that is a good idea, my friend...~ [BD42694]
@42695 = ~You again. Release me—NOW.~ [BD42695]
@42696 = ~I'm not going to do that.~
@42697 = ~Soon, Dorn. Soon.~
@42698 = ~Very well. My allies could use one such as you in the battle against Caelar.~
@42699 = ~It had better be. I am not known for my patience.~ [BD42699]
@42700 = ~A foolish mistake. You make an enemy of one you should cultivate as an ally. You may come to regret it.~ [BD42700]
@42701 = ~Excellent. Do it quickly lest the crusade realize what we're about.~ [BD42701]
@42702 = ~Actually, I've changed my mind.~
@42703 = ~I know what I'm doing, half-orc.~
@42704 = ~You play games with Dorn Il-Khan? Count yourself fortunate these bars are between us.~ [BD42704]
@42705 = ~Then do it.~ [BD42705]
@42706 = ~Yes. Yes! Few things taste so good as freedom.~ [BD42706]
@42707 = ~Glad I could be of assistance.~
@42708 = ~Well, enjoy the freedom quietly, at least till you clear the camp. There's a Flaming Fist camp to the south of here. Tell them <CHARNAME> sent you. They'll take care of you until I return.~
@42709 = ~Your captors' blood would surely be one of them. Join me and we will drink it by the bucket.~

@42713 = ~Do I know you?~
@42714 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. I joined Caelar this past week.~
@42715 = ~I don't think so.~
@42716 = ~Stand aside. I've important matters to attend to.~
@42717 = ~Gods. There's too many damned people joining this bloody thing. Okay, okay. I'm Munsch, Delgar Munsch. Right hand to Colonel Cordell. What're you doing now?~
@42718 = ~The same as everyone else—waiting for the order to take Bridgefort.~
@42719 = ~Whatever will aid us in our glorious cause, sir. Currently I'm cleaning latrines.~
@42720 = ~What the general told me to, or I was until you stopped me. What's your name again?~

@42727 = ~I told you to do that, did I? And what's my name again?~
@42728 = ~You said I was allowed to call you "sir."~
@42729 = ~I forget your real name. The others all call you the Old Mule.~
@42730 = ~I gave you a chance, fool.~
@42731 = ~Intruders! Intruders in the camp!~
@42732 = ~Nice try.~
@42733 = ~I don't think so, either. Which is strange, you see.~
@42734 = ~I'm Delgar Munsch, right hand to Colonel Cordell.~
@42735 = ~All these people you see? I gave 'em their assignments. But I don't remember you.~
@42736 = ~Are you sure?~
@42737 = ~It's a big crusade.~
@42738 = ~And that's my problem?~
@42739 = ~I never forget a face, an' I don't remember yours. Guess I'll haveta start paying more attention.~
@42740 = ~Be about yer business, then.~
@42741 = ~Stand aside? Stand aside, <PRO_HESHE> says. Do you know who I am?~
@42742 = ~Have a care. You're talkin' to a superior officer.~
@42743 = ~Aye, it is that. An' gettin' bigger every day.~
@42744 = ~SILENCE!~
@42745 = ~It is time. Hormorn?~
@42746 = ~It is, Barghest. Thank you. And welcome to you, noble and worthy servants of Caelar.~ [BD42746]
@42747 = ~You know why we are here: to receive the blessings of the gods. To feel their divine light shining within you.~ [BD42747]
@42748 = ~You can feel it, can't you? In your hearts, in your very souls, you know, you KNOW we walk a righteous path.~ [BD42748]
@42749 = ~That path will take us to the darkest place. The most hideous of devils we will face, but we know no devil shall harm us.~ [BD42749]
@42750 = ~We do the will of the gods. We do the will of Caelar Argent. Our victory in this realm and every other is assured!~ [BD42750]
@42751 = ~Thank you, Hormorn, and thank you, servants of the Shining Lady. Return to your tasks, secure in the knowledge that we have the favor of the gods. ~
@42752 = ~What the hells was that?~ [BD42752]
@42753 = ~The foundation upon which the Shining Lady has built her crusade. A confident voice, a few minor illusions, the monkeys eat it up.~
@42754 = ~They believe they do the will of the gods. ALL the gods.~ [BD42754]
@42755 = ~They will pay for their heresy, first with blood, then with their souls.~ [BD42755]

@42767 = ~Here, take the rope.~
@42768 = ~Surviving. You?~
@42769 = ~The same. I need to get across the moat.~
@42770 = ~About the same. Keep it up.~
@42771 = ~I'll be better once I'm away from this place. Give me the rope that I may cross the moat, now.~
@42772 = ~You do the same.~
@42773 = ~Here. YOU'RE WELCOME.~
@42774 = ~Ho there! You want back in? ~
@42775 = ~Please.~
@42776 = ~I do. If you'd be so kind as to throw the rope over?~
@42777 = ~Not just now.~
@42778 = ~Here, catch the rope and I'll pull you across.~
@42779 = ~As you wish.~
@42780 = ~Who are you who would challenge Caelar? ~
@42781 = ~I am <CHARNAME>.~
@42782 = ~Who am I? I am the Flaming Fist. I am Baldur's Gate. I am the heir of Bhaal. I am <CHARNAME>!~
@42783 = ~You don't need my name. You'll not live long enough to use it.~
@42784 = ~Truly? Excellent news! I've never killed a god's child before.~
@42785 = ~Truly? This is excellent news. I've never killed a god's child before. I shall make your blood a gift to my lady.~
@42786 = ~You'll try, fiend.~
@42787 = ~Really? Your lady's into some strange stuff, friend...~
@42788 = ~You'll choke on yours first, fiend.~
@42789 = ~Die! Die for those who are lost! Die that they may be found again!~
@42790 = ~I survived two wars of Dragonspear. I faced the legions of the Nine Hells, and still I stand before you. Do you truly think yourself a match for me?~
@42791 = ~Insulting the Shining Lady will be your last mistake.~
@42792 = ~Die, villain!~
@42793 = ~You should never have left Baldur's Gate, <PRO_SONDAUGHTER> of Bhaal. But I'm glad you did.~
@42794 = ~<CHARNAME>. What did you see out there? ~
@42795 = ~A lot of crusaders and a lot fewer Bridgefortians. But the latter are ready to strike in concert with us. Assemble the Flaming Fist. It's time to bring this battle to the crusade.~
@42796 = ~So many things, yet only a fraction of what I want to see. I'll be heading out again soon.~
@42797 = ~Nothing I care to share with you.~
@42798 = ~I'll tell Corporal Duncan gather everyone and prepare for an assault. ~
@42799 = ~Do it quickly. I'll march out and attack with you.~
@42800 = ~Hold. I don't want a fight—not just yet.~
@42801 = ~Flaming Fist fall in! We go to liberate our friends. The Battle of Bridgefort begins now!~
@42802 = ~Thanks for the help.~
@42803 = ~If you learn anything you think may be of use, let Duncan know. The crusaders outnumber us two to one. We'll need every advantage we can get.~
@42804 = ~All right. I don't understand the delay, but the dukes said to follow your lead. Let me know when you're ready to move.~
@42805 = ~We're waiting as you ordered.~
@42806 = ~Wait no longer—we move on the crusader camp now.~
@42807 = ~Be patient, just a little longer.~
@42808 = ~I will tell you—when the time has come. But it is not here yet.~
@42809 = ~What word of the crusade, <CHARNAME>? ~
@42810 = ~I've spoken to Khalid, and the Bridgefortians are ready for an assault. It's time to take the fight to the crusade.~
@42811 = ~I've spoken to Khalid, and the Bridgefortians are ready for an assault. When you hear sounds of combat, the Flaming Fist should march on the crusade.~
@42812 = ~None that I care to share with you.~
@42813 = ~Finally, the time has come. I'll get everyone ready.~
@42814 = ~Do it quickly. I'll march out with you.~
@42815 = ~Excellent. Wait until you hear sounds of combat from the fort. I'm going to return there and fight with the defenders.~
@42816 = ~All right, people! It's time for the crusade to taste Flaming Fist steel. Prepare for battle! Let's go, let's go!~
@42817 = ~You're as helpful as always. Get out of here. Go do something useful, or at least stop wasting my time.~
@42818 = ~All right. We'll be ready to mobilize as soon as you give the word.~
@42819 = ~We're ready to attack, <CHARNAME>. Are you? ~
@42820 = ~The time is right. Start the attack.~
@42821 = ~Not quite yet.~
@42822 = ~Let me know when you're ready to go.~
@42823 = ~That's what I like to hear.~
@42824 = ~At last! Caelar's light against Il-Khan's darkness! Only one shall survive!~
@42825 = ~There's got to be an easier way to do this.~
@42826 = ~Ho ho! If there's one thing Mighty Voghiln likes better than drinking, it's—~
@42827 = ~What am I saying? There's nothing Voghiln likes better than drinking! But a good fight's good too—variety is the spice of life.~
@42828 = ~I just got out of there, and you want to go back?~
@42829 = ~You want me to risk my life for... what, exactly?~
@42830 = ~The sooner this Bridgefort business is done, the sooner we can move on to Caelar. Let's make quick work of it.~
@42831 = ~Selûne guide my hand as I work to free Bridgefort from Caelar's.~
@42832 = ~Let's butcher these bumpkin binswangers!~
@42833 = ~Bridgefort stands! The crusade will fall!~
@42834 = ~I'm the only one here who doesn't like bloodshed, aren't I?~
@42835 = ~I might be able to lift one of you at most, but I'm not here to take you away.~
@42836 = ~You're the ones who will die today!~
@42837 = ~All right, I'm leaving.~
@42838 = ~What is this place, anyway?~
@42839 = ~What exactly happened to Slug?~
@42840 = ~And whoever wins this fight takes control of your band, is that right?~
@42841 = ~Run away, little <PRO_RACE>! Might get hurt if you stay!~
@42842 = ~Time to fight! Winner chief!~
@42843 = ~I'm glad I was able to help you, Murs. I think you'll make a fine chief. Now I must go.~
@42844 = ~Wait! You've helped me—maybe I can do something for you. Listen: There are crusaders camped just inside the tunnel entrance. The caves beyond them used to belong to us.~
@42845 = ~To reach tunnels, you need go through shiner camp in front of our old caves.~
@42846 = ~Two sea devils lair past the camp. They're idiots, but they're vicious. I used to tell them stories to let me pass.~
@42847 = ~Go north, then west. Stick to main tunnel. There ghosts down there. Sometimes hear screams INSIDE walls.~
@42848 = ~South across river is dark druid's place. Never go there. Go west and north and you find tunnels under castle. Shiner guards there too. Not easy to get in.~
@42849 = ~Got it?~
@42850 = ~I think so.~
@42851 = ~Can you go over the directions again?~
@42852 = ~Remember, free Slug and others if you see them. You have friends for life. Ogres not look like much, but we good friends to have.~
@42853 = ~I will find your mate and rescue all the prisoners, I swear it.~
@42854 = ~You can never have too many ogres in your debt.~
@42855 = ~Find your own mate. I've better things to do than waste my time searching for an ogre bandit foolish enough to get captured.~
@42856 = ~You pushing luck, "chief."~
@42857 = ~You've proven your strength, but unless you promise to free Slug and the others, I'll kill you right now. ~
@42858 = ~All right, I'll find him. If I free Slug, can I count on your people to help me against the crusade?~
@42859 = ~Seems I have no choice. If I do this for you, you have to help me fight the crusade.~
@42860 = ~Not if I kill you first.~
@42861 = ~You insult Slug? Too far! Murs smash you—crush you like tick!~
@42862 = ~Turn west past camp and stay on trail. Southwest is dark druid's place. You no go there.~
@42863 = ~When trail turns, follow it north. That take you to tunnels that go under castle.~
@42864 = ~Got it?~
@42865 = ~Got it.~
@42866 = ~Hah! Arbinge leader! You go now—or die!~
@42867 = ~Go. I have to obey chief.~
@42868 = ~With Murs dead, I do not know what we'll do. But we'll figure something out. Love will guide us.~
@42869 = ~I'm sure it will, Kaelet. You'll do fine.~
@42870 = ~Yeah. Sorry about that. I'll try not to kill the next person you ally with.~

@42876 = ~Takos, I've found the items you wanted.~
@42877 = ~I managed to locate some of the items you lost.~
@42878 = ~What items am I looking for again?~
@42879 = ~Just checking up on you.~
@42880 = ~Oh, go away. I don't have the energy to talk to anyone. Let me choke on the ashes and die. ~
@42881 = ~Why don't you tell me what's wrong? Maybe I can help.~
@42882 = ~Can I have your stuff once you choke and die?~
@42883 = ~I'll go when I feel like going. What happened here?~
@42884 = ~If you insist. Farewell.~
@42885 = ~I don't HAVE any stuff. That's the problem.~
@42886 = ~I can see where this tale ends. Farewell.~
@42887 = ~Consider things from her perspective. You did attack the crusaders alone, and after she asked you not to. Your inn was burned down because of it, and you could easily have been killed. And you have children.~
@42888 = ~Maybe you're right. Doesn't matter now. I've lost everything. My family. My inn. Even my cloak and shield, the mirror...~
@42889 = ~I'll be here, sitting in the scorched ruins of my dreams.~
@42890 = ~I'll tell you my story if it means you'll go away. A pack of clinking crusaders got drunk and rowdy. I decided to throw them out. THEY decided to put my inn to the torch.~
@42891 = ~Rowdy enough to burn down your inn?~
@42892 = ~I like my wine as much as the next <PRO_RACE>, but I've never set a place on fire during my revels.~
@42893 = ~And then?~
@42894 = ~Finally, they seemed ready to leave, but when I asked for fair payment, they laughed in my face. I was a city watchman once. I wasn't going to take that. My wife screamed at me to stop, but I tackled the nearest around his knees!~

@42896 = ~I didn't do much damage before they knocked me out, more's the pity. I woke up on the road. The Sterling Silver was as you see it. My wife was... gone.~

@42898 = ~What do you mean, gone?~
@42899 = ~You avenged her death, I take it?~
@42900 = ~What? No, she wasn't dead, she was GONE. Left me a note saying she was off to Baldur's Gate to stay with her odious mother, and taking the children with her.~
@42901 = ~I'm glad she's not dead, but I deeply regret all you've had to endure.~
@42902 = ~Her actions were harsh. A decent spouse stands by you, even when your inn gets burned down by drunken crusaders.~
@42903 = ~For your sake, I hope there's a point to this tale.~

@42905 = ~I'm sorry you had to endure all that. I can't do anything about the inn or your family. I might be able to help with the heirlooms.~
@42906 = ~Heirlooms? Valuable heirlooms?~
@42907 = ~Did the crusaders take the heirlooms? I could slay them and claim the treasure as my payment.~
@42908 = ~Nothing, it seems. I'll be on my way. Farewell.~
@42909 = ~I've lost everything. My family. My inn. My cloak and shield, the mirror... I might have something to live for if I got the heirlooms back.~

@42927 = ~Your confidence is appreciated. Now how about my reward?~
@42928 = ~I'm the one who does the murdering.~
@42929 = ~I found all three, but I believe I'll keep them for myself. They might fetch me a few gold at the next market I come across.~
@42930 = ~You truly are a hero, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Here, please take this dart as a token of my gratitude. I considered using it to kill myself—but I've a reason to go on now, thanks to you.~

@42964 = ~I'm coming, my love!~
@42965 = ~Well, keep looking! The last one must be out there!~

@42967 = ~I haven't the time. Can't you take just the two? For a fellow halfling?~
@42968 = ~Oh, I see. You have something more important to do than help a "fellow halfling" whose entire life has burned to cinders. I know how it is. Very well.~
@42969 = ~Here, take this dart. In my despair, I considered using it to end my life. Perhaps you'll find a target more worthy of it.~
@42970 = ~Gods! You're WORSE than the crusaders. You came back to what, just to taunt me? What kind of person does such a thing?~
@42971 = ~I just wanted to see the look on your face. Here, take the heirlooms back.~

@42984 = ~No business in particular. I'm just passing through.~

@42988 = ~Really, Isabella. There's no need to be rude. ~

@42990 = ~If your mission is so dangerous, perhaps you could use some help? For a fee, of course.~
@42991 = ~You seem ill equipped to fight anything truly dangerous.~
@42992 = ~Now if you'll excuse us, we've got things to do. Push off.~
@42993 = ~A vampire! So vile a creature shouldn't be allowed to exist. Let me help you destroy it.~
@42994 = ~I am a holy warrior. Please, let me assist you in this worthy venture.~
@42995 = ~I'll leave you to seek out your fiend, then.~
@42996 = ~That's a nice shield you have there. You wouldn't happen to have found it in a halfling's inn, would you?~
@42997 = ~Your aid would be appreciated, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@42998 = ~We have the vampire cornered. He's riddled the path with traps, so we can't get to him, but by the same token, his only way out is through us. Meet us here after dark if you want to help us finish this.~ [BD42998]

@43003 = ~A shield went missing when the Sterling Silver burned down. Did you find it?~
@43004 = ~I'm not saying you DID take the shield, but I don't know that you DIDN'T.~
@43005 = ~It means I think you're a thief. Hand over the shield.~
@43006 = ~We need the shield more than some innkeeper. Drop the matter or I'll run you through.~
@43007 = ~There's no need for violence, Isabella. Our enemy is the vampire.~
@43008 = ~If I help you kill the vampire, will you give me the shield?~
@43009 = ~That shield doesn't belong to you.~
@43010 = ~Give me the shield or I'll take it from you.~
@43011 = ~Yeah, that should work. All right. When the vampire's destroyed, the shield is yours.~
@43012 = ~Touch this shield and you'll regret it. My blade is sharp and ready for battle.~
@43013 = ~Apologies, but my companion is rather hot-tempered. She's not given to making idle threats, though—I'd back off if I were you.~
@43014 = ~If I help you kill the vampire, will you give me the shield?~
@43015 = ~One way or another, I'm taking that shield.~
@43016 = ~You leave me no choice!~

@43030 = ~Your name means nothing to me—all I care about is the reward I'll receive for ending you.~
@43031 = ~A harsh philosophy. I've done neither you nor these fanatics any harm, <PRO_RACE>, yet they would see me destroyed. I ask you, is this right?~ [BD43031]
@43032 = ~My name is Tsolak, though that is of little consequence. What matters is that I've done no harm to these fanatics so bent on my destruction. I ask you, is this right?~ [BD43032]
@43033 = ~Enough talk! Kill the monster—now!~ [BD43033]
@43034 = ~Let him speak, Isabella.~
@43035 = ~A better plan is to kill you, Isabella. You've probably collected some fine magic items in your time as a vampire hunter. I want them.~
@43036 = ~Die, vampire!~
@43037 = ~You're either with him or us. What'll it be?~
@43038 = ~If I must make a choice, the vampire dies, obviously.~
@43039 = ~Talk sense to your partner, Ikros. I don't want to fight you.~
@43040 = ~It'll be trouble if you don't ease up. I don't respond well to ultimatums.~
@43041 = ~I'll drain you dry and use you corpses as cordwood!~
@43042 = ~I trust Isabella's judgment. Even if I didn't, I'm not so foolish as to cross her.~
@43043 = ~Very well. Die, vampire!~
@43044 = ~I won't kill someone on her orders alone. Let the vampire say its piece.~
@43045 = ~If you stand with the monster, you stand against us. But you'll not be standing long!~
@43046 = ~If he has to speak, make him speak quickly.~
@43047 = ~Who are you, vampire?~
@43048 = ~What's your purpose here?~
@43049 = ~How many people have you fed on? How many have died at your hand?~
@43050 = ~My name is Tsolak, and I've done nothing to these hunters. I'm on a critical mission and can't be delayed. ~
@43051 = ~What mission is that?~
@43052 = ~You might not have hurt Isabella and Ikros, but you can't expect me to believe you've killed no one in order to feed.~
@43053 = ~I'm forbidden from revealing the details, but I've been on the road for some time now. I must reach Amn.~
@43054 = ~Even if you did nothing to these hunters, you must have killed many people in order to feed. ~
@43055 = ~I am what I am, but even a creature such as I can serve a purpose in this world. Let me pass and you will be richly rewarded by my master.~ [BD43055]
@43056 = ~Who is your master?~
@43057 = ~I can't let you go on killing people.~
@43058 = ~All right, but the reward had better be worth it.~
@43059 = ~Again, I cannot say, but I assure you he is very wealthy.~ [BD43059]
@43060 = ~I'm sorry. I can't let you go. I'll not have your victims' deaths on my conscience.~
@43061 = ~To make it worth my while to let you live? He'll need to be.~
@43062 = ~You ask that as though it might make a difference. I know better. Your holiness shines so bright it almost blinds. Nothing I could possibly say will stay your hand—so I'll not stay mine. Die!~
@43063 = ~You and I both serve a higher—and darker—purpose, <PRO_RACE>. We should not be enemies.~
@43064 = ~I serve my own purpose, vampire. There is none higher.~
@43065 = ~Creatures like us don't have friends.~
@43066 = ~Don't presume to tell me what should and should not be, bloodsucker.~
@43067 = ~I mean only that we both possess powers granted to us by a darker force. Together, we could destroy these self-righteous hunters.~
@43068 = ~Yes. We are kin that way.~
@43069 = ~I need something from them and nothing from you.~
@43070 = ~You have my thanks, <PRO_RACE>. Watch for my messenger!~ [BD43070]

@43074 = ~This isn't over yet. Where could the creature have gone?~
@43075 = ~He shouldn't be hard to find. We'll just look for a badly injured and really angry cloud.~
@43076 = ~This is your fault. Why didn't you tell me it could turn into mist?~
@43077 = ~He must have returned to his tomb—it's somewhere down the path; we hadn't found it yet. He'll reform there, but it'll take time. Here, take this stake. If you can find Tsolak, stake him through the heart.~ [BD43077]
@43078 = ~This path is heavily trapped, and we haven't found the vampire's tomb. Here, take this wooden stake. If you can find Tsolak, stake him through the heart.~
@43079 = ~What are you waiting for? Go find the vampire!~
@43080 = ~<CHARNAME>? I have a message here for <CHARNAME>. ~
@43081 = ~I am <PRO_HESHE>.~
@43082 = ~What sort of message?~
@43083 = ~Hand it over, then.~
@43084 = ~Tsolak thanks you for your assistance and bid me deliver this brooch to you as a reward.~
@43085 = ~What news?~ [BD43085]
@43086 = ~Tsolak has been destroyed. He will kill no more.~
@43087 = ~I wanted to thank you for your help killing Tsolak. I wanted to, but I can't, as he was slain with no help from you whatsoever.~
@43088 = ~I've returned for my reward.~
@43089 = ~I've nothing of consequence to report. Farewell.~
@43090 = ~I had a feeling you wouldn't have difficulty finishing Tsolak off.~
@43091 = ~Few things will keep me from driving evil from the world wherever I find it.~
@43092 = ~Difficult or no, we agreed I would be rewarded for slaying the vampire.~
@43093 = ~Thanks. Now give me the shield, please.~
@43094 = ~Here, take this shield. It belonged to the halfling whose inn burned down east of here. Return it to him with my apologies. ~
@43095 = ~Yes, yes, of course. Here, take it.~
@43096 = ~And this gold as well, take it, please. May it aid you on your travels. ~
@43097 = ~Thank you. Good luck in your travels as well.~
@43098 = ~I never say no to gold.~
@43099 = ~A paltry sum, but I'll take it nonetheless.~
@43100 = ~Until we meet again. ~
@43101 = ~Tra la la la!~
@43102 = ~Hmmm hmmm mmmmm.~
@43103 = ~Do re mi mi mi mi...~
@43104 = ~Oh, hello! Apologies for not greeting you sooner. I was a bit... distracted? Didn't notice you.~
@43105 = ~No apology is necessary. I didn't want to disturb your song.~
@43106 = ~Were you singing to that rock?~
@43107 = ~That's hardly a surprise, considering the racket you're making.~
@43108 = ~I've learned the secret of the singing menhirs.~
@43109 = ~Get away from me!~
@43110 = ~I probably look a little strange, don't I? This is a very unusual stone, though. It fascinates me.~
@43111 = ~It looks old. What's that writing carved upon it? ~
@43112 = ~Do you always sing at natural objects that fascinate you?~
@43113 = ~You seem more than "a little strange." It's only a rock.~
@43114 = ~Would that I was capable of finding a rock so absorbing. I'll leave you to contemplate its mysteries.~
@43115 = ~It's not natural. I was walking the Coast Way, singing as I worked out a new song, when I heard the stone, humming!~
@43116 = ~Intriguing. Was it humming a particular song? Perhaps trying to communicate with you?~
@43117 = ~I'd think it was trying to talk to you, but what could a rock have to say?~
@43118 = ~Nonsense. You're imagining things.~
@43119 = ~At first, I thought I might be going mad, but there are menhirs like this all over this side of the crossing. They all responded to my humming.~
@43120 = ~When I sing to more than one, their tones last longer. They stop eventually, though. I'd try to find all of them, but the forest is too dangerous.~
@43121 = ~Thanks for sharing your story. I'll watch for these menhirs.~
@43122 = ~Can I try singing to your menhir?~
@43123 = ~Too dangerous for you, perhaps. I'll find them.~
@43124 = ~A pity. I have to be going now.~
@43125 = ~Could you tell me exactly where you found the menhirs?~
@43126 = ~Could you tell me exactly where you found the menhirs?~
@43127 = ~If you find them all and learn why they're singing, could you return and let me know? ~

@43136 = ~No. I have to go.~
@43137 = ~Where exactly did you find these other menhirs?~

@43143 = ~That's spectacular. Crommus's story will make an epic ballad. I can't thank you enough!~
@43144 = ~Good luck with your composing.~
@43145 = ~I'll receive a portion of any monies generated by this song, of course.~
@43146 = ~I find it an overly sentimental, pathetic story myself. There truly is no accounting for taste.~
@43147 = ~I can think of no nobler quest than helping out a fellow bard and a beautiful lady.~

@43150 = ~That's a rotten thing to do to a bard.~

@43152 = ~It's a great story. I would save its telling for myself.~
@43153 = ~Because I can.~

@43208 = ~Perhaps time has clouded my memory... at any rate, he was very unpleasant. He would often cut into line at the bakery and buy all the cinnamon rolls.~
@43209 = ~Carline and I fell in love. She was beautiful as a spring day. She had a fondness for pinning flowers in her hair—I remember how prettily they drooped over her ear.~
@43210 = ~She begged to be released from her engagement to Artipheon, to no avail. And so she came to me and said, "If we can't be together in life, my love, we can in death."~
@43211 = ~She wanted you to make a lover's pact?~
@43212 = ~A little drastic, don't you think? Couldn't you have just run away together?~
@43213 = ~The passion of lovers is for death. Go on.~
@43214 = ~I paraphrased slightly. As I recall, her exact words were, "Father's impossible. Let's go to the coast and set up a flower shop." And so we fled. But Artipheon would not let Carline go. He pursued us, catching up to us just as we crossed the Winding Water.~
@43215 = ~I thought life preferable to suicide—we fled. But Artipheon would not let Carline go. He caught us just as we crossed the Winding Water.~
@43216 = ~He caught up to us just as we crossed the Winding Water. He paralyzed me with a spell and snatched Carline away as I watched helplessly.~
@43217 = ~He paralyzed me with a spell and snatched Carline away as I watched helplessly. Then in his rage he stole my voice and shattered it, binding each fragment in the petrified tooth of a great dragon.~
@43218 = ~That's terrible!~
@43219 = ~These menhirs are DRAGON TEETH? They look like ordinary rock to me.~
@43220 = ~And then?~
@43221 = ~Encase my voice in common stone? No. They're dragon teeth. Definitely.~
@43222 = ~Artipheon took Carline and left me to die. Since then, my spirit has wandered these woods, voiceless and alone—until now. Thanks to you, I can sing once more! Carline... come to me, my love...~ [BD43222]
@43223 = ~Since then my spirit has wandered, voiceless, in these woods. Thanks to you, my voice is free and I can sing once more!~
@43224 = ~Carline... come to me, my love...~
@43225 = ~What is this? Where am I? Who—? You! I remember you... Artipheon! Foul one! I will destroy you! DESTROY YOU ALL!~ [BD43225]
@43226 = ~Carline. All these years, I longed to call to you, but I couldn't—until now. Thanks to this kind stranger, we are together again.~
@43227 = ~I wish you and Carline all the best, Crommus.~
@43228 = ~I'd ask for a reward, but it's a rare ghost's purse that'll have any gold. Ah, well. I suppose a good deed will have be its own reward on this occasion.~
@43229 = ~Be off with you then, the both of you.~
@43230 = ~I was buried in a barrow not far from here, in the eastern side of the forest. Seek out my grave—whatever you find there, take with my blessing. But beware—an evil presence resides nearby.~
@43231 = ~Many thanks.~
@43232 = ~I'll feel better knowing I have permission, but in truth, I'd probably have taken anything I found there regardless.~
@43233 = ~I'll ransack the barrow and take all that I find.~
@43234 = ~May you find comfort and solace in the melodies of Milil, until we meet again. Farewell.~
@43235 = ~I'm afraid I have little to trade. When I fled the crusade, I had to leave much behind.~
@43236 = ~I'd like to see what you have for sale.~
@43237 = ~What can you tell me about the goings-on in the area?~
@43238 = ~Your troubles bore me.~
@43239 = ~I've returned, Herod. Teleria is dead. She was petrifying refugees for art, but I did my best to restore the victims.~
@43240 = ~Once, yes, but no longer. Everyone here left their lived behind when the crusade swept through the High Moor, and I am no different.~
@43241 = ~Everyone does seem troubled here. You've had some problems establishing this camp, I take it?~
@43242 = ~No one seems about to break into song and dance, that's for sure.~
@43243 = ~Sorrow and hardships are part of life.~
@43244 = ~Everyone here left their lives behind when the crusade swept through the High Moor, and I am no different. The crusaders have seized the Coast Way bridge, blocking the route north. And if losing our homes wasn't bad enough, we've started losing our friends now too.~
@43245 = ~People are going missing?~
@43246 = ~That's a shame. Can I see what you have for sale?~
@43247 = ~I've heard this tale of woe more times than I care to recall. I'd tell you to fare well if I thought you could be bothered to try.~
@43248 = ~We've had a spell of troubles. We're all refugees and we banded together for survival, but some of us have vanished. Five have gone missing so far, leaving all their possessions behind. It's a right mystery.~
@43249 = ~Have you any clues to what happened?~
@43250 = ~So their possessions are just lying around? Interesting. Tell me more.~
@43251 = ~They probably wandered into the woods and were devoured by wild beasts.~
@43252 = ~I don't know anything, really. But... you see that tall elf woman? Teleria's her name. She arrived right before the disappearances started. No one knows anything about her.~
@43253 = ~If I see the missing people, I'll let you know.~
@43254 = ~I'm not going to arrest or kill someone on your hunch. I'd just like a place to start looking.~
@43255 = ~Just tell me who you suspect. Don't worry, I won't tell them you pointed them out.~
@43256 = ~Hearsay at best. The woman is probably completely innocent and I won't disturb her. Farewell.~
@43257 = ~I don't like to speak without proof. ~
@43258 = ~I'm not going to arrest or kill someone on your hunch. I'd just like a place to start looking.~
@43259 = ~Just tell me who you suspect. Don't worry, I won't tell them you pointed them out.~
@43260 = ~Don't make me force you to speak.~
@43261 = ~All right, all right... see that tall elf woman? Teleria's her name. She arrived right before the disappearances started. No one knows anything about her.~
@43262 = ~The new arrival is the first suspected. Well, it's a place to start. I'll speak to her.~
@43263 = ~She and my knuckles are going to have a little talk. I'll find out what she's up to.~
@43264 = ~That will change shortly, if she knows what's good for her.~
@43265 = ~Go easy on her. I don't know for sure that she's involved. Luck to you.~
@43266 = ~I'm sorry, stranger. I'm afraid troubles are all we've got. People have been going missing and no one knows what to do about it. Five have vanished so far, leaving all their possessions behind.~
@43267 = ~Everyone here does seem... subdued. What problems are you having?~
@43268 = ~The camp seems in little danger of a song and dance outbreak, that's for sure.~
@43269 = ~I've heard more tale of woe more times than I care to of late, so I think I'll just leave you to your misery.~
@43270 = ~Gods, I hope not! ~
@43271 = ~Do you have any clues as to what might have happened?~
@43272 = ~You think it was a person who took them, then? Who? Why?~
@43273 = ~I don't deal in hope. Can you tell me anything else about the disappearances?~
@43274 = ~Luck to you.~
@43275 = ~I heard what you did. We're all grateful to you for getting to the bottom of this matter.~
@43276 = ~You're quite welcome.~
@43277 = ~I just happened to be in the right place at the right time for the right reward.~
@43278 = ~Someone had to resolve the issue. You people obviously weren't up to it.~
@43279 = ~I took up a collection among the refugees, and we'd like you to have the money as a reward. ~
@43280 = ~Very generous. Thank you.~
@43281 = ~Please, keep it. You need it more than I—I'm just happy I was able to help.~
@43282 = ~Convenient. Saves me the trouble of shaking everyone down individually.~
@43283 = ~Give it here, then.~
@43284 = ~Such generosity—such selflessness... If only the world had more like you. You'll always have friends here. Fare well on your travels.~
@43285 = ~Here you are. Thank you again for your help, and luck to you on your travels.~
@43286 = ~It's too bad we couldn't save the others, but at least no one else will be turned to stone. Thank you again. Luck on your travels.~
@43287 = ~What is it you want, stranger?~
@43288 = ~I was wondering if you might be able to tell me anything about these woods?~
@43289 = ~Conversation, mostly. You seem like an interesting person.~
@43290 = ~Nothing. I'll be going.~
@43291 = ~I heard some people have gone missing from this camp recently.~
@43292 = ~I know nothing of interest, and I value my privacy. Leave me alone.~
@43293 = ~Goodbye.~
@43294 = ~I've heard the same, but I don't know anyone who has vanished.~
@43295 = ~Herod tells me people started disappearing shortly after you arrived. He thinks you have something to do with the disappearances.~
@43296 = ~Have you seen anything suspicious?~
@43297 = ~Any ideas about what might have happened to the missing people?~
@43298 = ~Why would he say such a thing? ~
@43299 = ~You showed up right when people started disappearing.~
@43300 = ~No one knows anything about you.~
@43301 = ~You keep to yourself and don't seem like the other refugees.~
@43302 = ~That's very interesting that he would cast suspicion on me.~
@43303 = ~Are you suggesting Herod had something to do with the disappearances?~
@43304 = ~And understandable, considering the circumstances.~
@43305 = ~You have one chance to tell me everything you know.~
@43306 = ~There are too many people around. I can't say anything here. There's a clearing just inside the forest northwest of here. Meet me there—I'll tell you what I know.~
@43307 = ~I'm new, and I keep to myself—I'm an easy target, nothing more. But keeping my own counsel doesn't mean I don't hear things, though. Or see things.~
@43308 = ~What have you seen?~
@43309 = ~No one's accusing you of anything. Yet. But if you know something, you need to tell me now, before things get ugly.~
@43310 = ~If you value your life, you'll tell me everything you know, now.~
@43311 = ~Just inside the forest northwest of here there's a clearing with a small pond. I like to go there to think. Meet me there and I'll tell you what I know. ~
@43312 = ~And here you are. ~
@43313 = ~Indeed I am. Now tell me what you know of those who've gone missing.~
@43314 = ~What's with all the sculptures?~
@43315 = ~There's no one around to overhear us now. No more excuses—tell me what you know.~
@43316 = ~I was only passing by.~
@43317 = ~I'm still working on getting those two new subjects for you. I'll return soon.~
@43318 = ~As are you—but not for long.~
@43319 = ~I am an artist unlike this land has ever seen. These statues are my creations, taken from flesh and made perfect, eternal stone through magic. They are more beautiful than they ever were in life.~
@43320 = ~Five refugees... five statues. There's one mystery solved, at least.~
@43321 = ~Have you considered erosion? Wear and tear are going to break these figures right down.~
@43322 = ~Average work at best.~
@43323 = ~You're a clever one, aren't you? I had decided to add you as my next piece, but I cannot bring myself to do that to another elf. Begone now, before I change my mind.~
@43324 = ~I'll not turn my back on these petrified people.~
@43325 = ~You don't need to tell me twice.~
@43326 = ~They are my pride and my legacy. My display is not complete, though. With my assistant's help, I will add another piece to the exhibit. YOU.~
@43327 = ~Return these statues to life, elf. I'll not ask you again.~
@43328 = ~I'd rather die. And I'd MUCH rather you die.~
@43329 = ~I hope you're prepared to suffer for your art, you demented bore.~
@43330 = ~Wait a moment, let's talk about this. What if I could get you an even better subject?~
@43331 = ~I'll not bargain with a half-breed. Your very existence offends—but by my hand you will be ennobled, transformed into an object of significance and meaning. You will become art—this is my gift to you. Now hold still. This probably won't hurt.~
@43332 = ~An interesting proposal. Let me ask you something first. Have you seen the stone menhirs scattered throughout the forest?~
@43333 = ~Yes, I've noticed them.~
@43334 = ~Can't say that I have.~
@43335 = ~What possible difference could that make?~
@43336 = ~The singing ones? Yes, I activated them all and released the voice trapped within.~
@43337 = ~WHAT? You defaced the work of Artipheon? You vulgar brute! You'll pay for that!~
@43338 = ~They were placed here centuries ago by a powerful wizard. Though he is long dead, they stand as a testimonial to his artistic genius.~
@43339 = ~I want to create the same sort of legacy. Artipheon was a great wizard, a true inspiration. I would honor his memory with a tableau of petrified individuals. ~
@43340 = ~There is no cause greater than artistic expression. What pieces do you need to complete your tableau?~
@43341 = ~Your motives mean little to me. Just tell me what you need.~
@43342 = ~Teleria, I'm a wizard too and I see a flaw in your plan. These statues will never last. They are too perfect, too detailed. Anyone who sees them will know they're petrified people. Someone WILL try to restore one of your subjects to the flesh.~
@43343 = ~The woman is insane. We should kill her instead of wasting time.~
@43344 = ~I wouldn't even add you to my tableau, half-orc. Your face is too hideous. Die instead!~
@43345 = ~Oh? And what's that?~
@43346 = ~These statues will never last. They are too perfect, too detailed. Any intelligent person who sees them will know they're petrified people.~
@43347 = ~That doesn't matter! They'll be all the more impressed by my power. ~
@43348 = ~Sooner or later someone will try turning a person back to flesh. And once one person is reverted, the whole tableau will be ruined. ~
@43349 = ~And once one person is reverted, the whole tableau will be ruined. All that work, lost! You—you're right. I must leave—take some time to think, consider other ways I might honor Artipheon.~
@43350 = ~Before you go, do you have a way to turn these people back to flesh?~
@43351 = ~Don't let me see your face again.~
@43352 = ~You're not going anywhere. Your corpse will lie here among your victims, a monument to your own ego.~
@43353 = ~Here, take these scrolls. They'll return my beautiful statues to flawed flesh.~
@43354 = ~Farewell.~
@43355 = ~If I can't add you to my tableau, I'll see you destroyed!~
@43356 = ~To complete my tableau, I require an armored soldier and a handsome nobleman. Lure them here and you will be rewarded.~
@43357 = ~Consider it done.~
@43358 = ~They'll be poor substitutes for my beautiful face, but I'll get them for you.~
@43359 = ~Too much effort. I think I'll just kill you and take my reward from your corpse.~
@43360 = ~ONE two three four MARCH two three four...~
@43361 = ~Keeping your skills sharp, I see.~
@43362 = ~Report, soldier!~
@43363 = ~What in the Nine Hells are you doing?~
@43364 = ~May I have a word, soldier? I've a mission for you.~
@43365 = ~Doesn't do to get soft, not at all! The battle will come sooner than we think. HUP two three four.~
@43366 = ~Carry on, then. ~
@43367 = ~What are you doing? You're not really going to let Teleria turn this soldier into stone?~
@43368 = ~No, of course not.~
@43369 = ~I believe that was the bargain.~
@43370 = ~All right. Good.~
@43371 = ~Not going to happen. Soldier! Carry on and do NOT leave this camp.~
@43372 = ~Aye, sir!~
@43373 = ~Yes, sir!~
@43374 = ~I have a mission for you, soldier. ~
@43375 = ~I'm a ma'am, actually.~
@43376 = ~Yes, sir! ~
@43377 = ~Um... all right, fine. I've a mission for you. There's a clearing in the forest, not far from here. White flowers growing there can be used to make healing salves. I need you to gather some.~
@43378 = ~What can I do for you, sir?~
@43379 = ~In the forest to the west, there's a small clearing. White flowers growing there can be used in healing salves. I need you to get some.~
@43380 = ~I'm under orders not to leave camp, sir! ~
@43381 = ~The healing salves are needed to heal our soldiers. Do you want them to die?~
@43382 = ~I'm a new officer brought in from another camp and I'm ordering you to go get those flowers.~
@43383 = ~The forest is a dangerous place, and I can see you're the strongest and most experienced soldier here. It has to be you.~
@43384 = ~Sir, yes, sir! I'll return as soon as I can!~
@43385 = ~Sorry, sir, you'll have to clear this with my commander.~
@43386 = ~Gods help me, no more, please. I've endured so much. I can take no more...~
@43387 = ~What's happened? Maybe I can help.~
@43388 = ~Oh dear, did you get mud on your silk robes?~
@43389 = ~Cease this sniveling or I'll give you something to moan about.~
@43390 = ~Your pardon, my lord. I was wondering, could you tell me what your noble insignia looks like?~
@43391 = ~Leave me to my misery. My wealth—stolen. My home—burned. I have nothing to live for. Nothing!~
@43392 = ~The Vessanal family's crest is a four-winged pegasus before crossed swords. Not that it means anything now.~
@43393 = ~You may be in better shape than you realize. In the woods just inside the forest's edge, in a clearing, I saw a locked chest. It had that very seal on its lid.~
@43394 = ~Where, where? Perhaps I'm not destitute after all! ~
@43395 = ~Just inside the forest's edge, in a clearing by a pond. ~
@43396 = ~Oh, thank you, stranger! There's a silver piece in that chest with your name on it! ~
@43397 = ~No! Aaaaaaugh!~
@43398 = ~You did well, finding me such fine subjects. Already I can envision their place within my great work.~
@43399 = ~Excellent. I'll just take my reward and be on my way.~
@43400 = ~I enjoyed luring these fools to their death. ~
@43401 = ~I care nothing for their fate, I only want payment.~
@43402 = ~Here, take this figurine. With it, you can summon my golem assistant.~
@43403 = ~Thank you.~
@43404 = ~I can always use an extra pair of hands.~
@43405 = ~Hand it over.~
@43406 = ~I think it best that we not cross paths again. Farewell. ~
@43407 = ~Forgive me. I meant no offense.~
@43408 = ~Go away! I'm busy here.~ [BD43408]
@43409 = ~You are Wynan Hess, are you not? Khalid told me to seek you out regarding the fort's defenses.~
@43410 = ~Oh, fine. Defenses, what've we got...? Not much. A few fighters, some mercenaries and guards. Most here are travelers, trapped inside when the crusade crossed the Winding Water.~
@43411 = ~I can tell. Vitally important work it is too, staring at a corner.~
@43412 = ~Watch your tone, old man.~
@43413 = ~I maintain the wards that protect us from the crusade's siege weapons. They— Wait. Another wizard is fighting me. I must concentrate. I need to—~ [BD43413]
@43414 = ~I'm working the wards that keep us safe from siege weapons, and to do that I need to concentrate. Begone!~
@43415 = ~Damn it! Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!~ [BD43415]
@43416 = ~Someone help Lexa!~
@43417 = ~She's beyond our help, son.~
@43418 = ~Wynan? I th-thought you were shielding the fort from this kind of attack?~ [BD43418]
@43419 = ~What's going on here, Hess? You were supposed to protect us from this sort of attack!~
@43420 = ~And I did, for as long as I could. The crusade has mages too, you know. I couldn't maintain the redblooding wards—you'd have done no better!~ [BD43420]
@43421 = ~Forgive me—I shouldn't have distracted you.~
@43422 = ~It happens to every mage once or twice in their life, I'm told.~
@43423 = ~What's done is done. We have greater concerns now.~
@43424 = ~There's nothing to be done about it now. ~
@43425 = ~I feel sick. Something strange is happening.~
@43426 = ~This attack isn't over yet. The stone is emitting a negative energy field—sapping the strength of all around it.~
@43427 = ~In truth, I probably couldn't have held the shield much longer anyway. The longer this mess lasts, the weaker I grow.~
@43428 = ~Is there something to be done about the giant glowing rock?~
@43429 = ~I see no benefit in standing here waiting for the crusade's next attack. I'll be going now.~
@43430 = ~I was told to seek you out. I should have been warned about your work's critical nature.~
@43431 = ~The Creeping Darkness

I should investigate the fort and find the source of the impact.

I spoke to the wizard Wynan Hess. Immediately afterward, a violent impact shook the fort. I must learn what happened.~
@43432 = ~What—what's happening...? I—uhhhh...~
@43433 = ~Wynan! Wh-what's happened to him?~
@43434 = ~It's the stone—there's an unnatural magical aura surrounding it.~
@43435 = ~It's emitting a negative energy field—sapping the strength of all around it.~
@43436 = ~Yes—I can feel it weakening me even as we speak. How can we stop it?~
@43437 = ~Edwin? Have you any insight to offer on this?~
@43438 = ~Baeloth, I believe this is your area.~
@43439 = ~Dynaheir, can you shed any light on what's going on here?~
@43440 = ~What tipped you off? Was it the glowing symbols? ~
@43441 = ~With each passing second, I feel it leeching power from my body. I must be away from it.~
@43442 = ~I have seen these sigils before... I was working on such a design for Caelar before we, er, parted company. The hand behind this magic is that snake, Vichand!~
@43443 = ~That's all well and good, but what are we going to do about it?~
@43444 = ~Perhaps the answer lies in the crusader camp. They are the ones responsible for this attack.~
@43445 = ~What do you think, Wynan?~
@43446 = ~Edwin? Any ideas?~
@43447 = ~Baeloth, I believe this is your area.~
@43448 = ~Dynaheir, can you do anything about this?~
@43449 = ~The stone is enchanted with a dark, leeching power. Left unchecked, sickness and death will spread throughout the fort. To stop it, I'll need the scroll used to enchant the rock.~
@43450 = ~With each passing second, strength seeps from my body. I must be away from this damnable rock!~
@43451 = ~The longer this is left unchecked, the worse it will get. The field will grow, in size and intensity. Soon all within this fort will be dead or dying. To stop it, we will need the original spellscroll Vichand used to enchant the rock.~
@43452 = ~The stone's sorcery will spread, striking down first the sickly, then the strong. We must seek the spellscroll that started the sequence to stymie this scheme.~ [BD43452]
@43453 = ~This is dark magic, <CHARNAME>. The stone's energy will grow, weakening the strong and striking down the weak. To save all souls in Bridgefort, we need the original enchanter's spellscroll.~ [BD43453]
@43454 = ~If the s-spell scroll is anywhere, it-it-it'll be in the crusade's camp.~
@43455 = ~The negative energy contained in the stone will spread, weakening all those in Bridgefort's walls who it doesn't kill outright. If I had the original spellcaster's scroll, I might be able to terminate the enchantment.~ [BD43455]
@43456 = ~You've got to get into the crusade camp and find that scroll. Without it, Bridgefort will surely fall.~
@43457 = ~I won't allow that to happen. You can count on me to get the scroll.~
@43458 = ~Me? Why am I always the one who has to risk <PRO_HISHER> life to save the day? Fine, I'll do it.~
@43459 = ~If the fort falls, I fall with it. It seems I have no choice.~
@43460 = ~While I will attempt to get the scroll AND stay alive. Not necessarily in that order.~ [BD43460]
@43461 = ~There's no time to waste—I can feel the stone's magic moving through my body even as we speak. Go, get the scroll—save us all.~
@43462 = ~I encountered a Red Wizard in the crusader camp. He had this scroll—could it be the one we need?~
@43463 = ~Let me see it... yes, that's it. We've taken a hit, but with this, at least the damage can be minimized. Give me a moment to prepare myself and then speak with me again.~ [BD43463]
@43464 = ~Find the scroll and return to me as quickly as you can.~ [BD43464]
@43465 = ~What n-news?~ [BD43465]
@43466 = ~I have the scroll we need to end this curse on Bridgefort.~
@43467 = ~Nothing, I'm afraid. I will depart soon in an effort to find the scroll needed to disable the spellstone.~
@43468 = ~The scroll?~
@43469 = ~Nothing so far. I have much more to accomplish than your tasks.~
@43470 = ~You've s-saved us all! Quickly, bring the scroll to the st-stone!~
@43471 = ~If you c-cannot, we're doomed. P-Please make haste. We're c-counting on you.~
@43472 = ~The scroll that will l-let us cancel the neg-negative energy field afflicting everyone in the fort.~
@43473 = ~That explains why I feel so weak. Take heart, Khalid—I will find this scroll.~
@43474 = ~Oh, THAT scroll. Right. I'm on it.~
@43475 = ~Why are you still here? You're supposed to be getting the scroll from the crusaders.~ [BD43475]
@43476 = ~I'll be taking care of that shortly, I assure you.~
@43477 = ~I wanted to speak to you of a different scroll—one with a coded message on it.~
@43478 = ~The scroll?~
@43479 = ~And so I shall—when I see fit.~
@43480 = ~The scroll that will enable us to dispel the negative energy field that's slowly killing everyone in Bridgefort? Remember? ~
@43481 = ~I do now. I'll head out to find it directly.~
@43482 = ~Oh, THAT scroll. Right. I'm on it.~
@43483 = ~I do remember. I will retrieve the scroll, you can count on that. But I will do so at a time of my own choosing.~
@43484 = ~Go, then. People are dying, there's no time to waste.~
@43485 = ~The one you gave me just after the spellstone hit.~
@43486 = ~The same.~
@43487 = ~You remember. Excellent.~
@43488 = ~If it'll get you out looking for the other scroll faster, let's take a look at it. ~
@43489 = ~Here it is. ~
@43490 = ~Let me see here. Hmmm... Yes...~
@43491 = ~I can translate it, but it will take some time. Time you should use to seek out the scroll that will save everyone in this fort.~
@43492 = ~Agreed.~
@43493 = ~If I get the one scroll, you'll translate this one? All right. I'll do it.~
@43494 = ~Do not try to pressure me, mage. You'll not like the result.~
@43495 = ~People are dying, you useless knob! If you're not going to get out there and get the scroll, at the very least get away from me. Begone!~
@43496 = ~Well, get on with it, then. You may have time to chat, but I certainly don't. Begone!~
@43497 = ~Careful, <CHARNAME>. If this is the mage we seek and we don't tip our hand, I might be able to steal the scroll right out of the man's scarlet pocket.~ [BD43497]
@43498 = ~An excellent plan, milord. I must be on my way now.~
@43499 = ~It's been a while since I picked any pockets, but if you want, I can try to lift the scroll off that mage. Maybe then we can get out of this dreary camp.~ [BD43499]
@43500 = ~I'm flattered by your interest, but I'm afraid the scroll must stay with me. It's too valuable to leave my person. When the siege is over, you may study it, but for now, goodbye.~ [BD43500]
@43501 = ~I suppose it will do no harm to share my brilliance with another. Take a look at the scroll, but be sure to bring it back promptly. Good day to you.~ [BD43501]
@43502 = ~You'll find the spellstone's scroll and bring it back here?~
@43503 = ~I will.~
@43504 = ~Yes... That's what I'll do...~
@43505 = ~I will find the scroll. What I do with it after that remains to be seen.~
@43506 = ~Well—good. Go, then. People are dying, there's no time to waste. ~
@43507 = ~What is this—?~ [BD43507]
@43508 = ~We meet again, Vichand.~ [BD43508]
@43509 = ~Odesseiron. I haven't seen you since Dragonspear when you required convincing to join the crusade. Good to see you had the sense to stay with us.~ [BD43509]
@43510 = ~You know this man, Edwin?~
@43511 = ~Oh yes. We're all loyal crusaders. I have a few questions for you.~
@43512 = ~Before you and Edwin catch up on old times, perhaps you could answer a question for me.~
@43513 = ~Crusaders? Oh no. We're here to put an end to you and to the crusade.~
@43514 = ~And now we have to be going. Excuse us.~
@43515 = ~My apologies. There's something else I'd like to ask you.~
@43516 = ~Y-yes... crusaders. (That will do for now. The cretin will never figure out the truth.)~
@43517 = ~You are disturbing my meditation. Begone. ~
@43518 = ~There will be no gold for you, betrayer—just the cold embrace of your well-deserved demise!~ [BD43518]
@43519 = ~My deepest apologies, my lord.~
@43520 = ~The Creeping Darkness

The spellstone has been deactivated, and Bridgefort is safe.

Using the attack on the crusade as cover, Wynan Hess was able to steal a copy of the needed scroll and deactivate the dangerous spellstone.~
@43521 = ~Why do you disturb my meditations?~
@43522 = ~Who are you?~
@43523 = ~Have you any magic items for sale?~

@43525 = ~Are you the magician who designed the spellstone that's infecting the inhabitants of Bridgefort?~
@43526 = ~You are clearly a magician of great skill and power. I would like to learn from your work. Might I study the scroll you used? Perhaps I could come up with an additional spell with which to plague the defenders of the fort.~
@43527 = ~You heard about that, did you? Yes, it was an enchantment of my design. Quite effective. The fort will fall in days, if not hours. Caelar should be well pleased with my efforts.~ [BD43527]
@43528 = ~I need to know how to stop the stone's effects.~
@43529 = ~That is why I am not pleased with your efforts. How do I stop the stone, wizard?~
@43530 = ~Caelar's not here right now. You would be wise to focus on pleasing me. Tell me how to terminate the spellstone's effects, mage—or I'll terminate you in their stead.~
@43531 = ~You would see them stopped—? Who are you, exactly? ~
@43532 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate. Now tell me how to end the spell or by the gods I'll not be responsible for what happens to you.~
@43533 = ~A friend of Bridgefort. That is all you need know.~
@43534 = ~I'm the last person you want to cross, that's who I am. Now tell me what I want to know.~
@43535 = ~Do not hurt me—please! I'll give you what you want.~
@43536 = ~You should never have come here. Now you shall die!~
@43537 = ~I do not want to hear your apologies. I want to hear nothing from you. Just go.~
@43538 = ~Edwin's Tale of Woe

We will defeat Vichand when the time is right.

I encountered the Red Wizard, Vichand, in the crusader camp. Edwin craves vengeance on the man and intends to kill him at the first opportunity. If I meet Vichand in combat, Edwin will be profoundly grateful. Or as grateful as he ever gets.~
@43539 = ~You think to threaten me, Vichand, first son of Orannias, vizier to monarchs, and master of the one true element? Then die, die like the fool you are!~ [BD43539]
@43540 = ~He was right there! That backstabbing, betraying CHARLATAN. I could have had my revenge!~ [BD43540]
@43541 = ~What are you doing here? What is it you want?~
@43542 = ~Have you any magic items for sale?~
@43543 = ~I'm looking for a feather plucked from a planetar wing. I don't suppose you have one?~
@43544 = ~I take it you had a hand in the creation of the spellstone that's draining the lives of those in Bridgefort. Give us the scroll you used to create the stone and we'll leave you in peace.~
@43545 = ~I've gotten everything I could possibly want from you. Farewell.~
@43546 = ~There is nothing we want from you, wizard. Nothing but your death.~
@43547 = ~Your end is nigh, traitor!~ [BD43547]
@43548 = ~I see. In that case, I have nothing more to ask.~
@43549 = ~You have the honor of addressing Vichand, Red Wizard of Thay, loyal servant to the Shining Lady, Caelar Argent.~
@43550 = ~And if I did? What business is that of yours?~
@43551 = ~The gold business. I'd like to purchase it.~
@43552 = ~A bloody one, if you don't give me the feather.~
@43553 = ~Show me the gold. ~
@43554 = ~Here. Take what you think it's worth.~
@43555 = ~Oh, this is embarrassing—I don't actually have any.~
@43556 = ~You insult my devotion with an offer of gold? Once there was a time I would have considered your offer, but those days are past. Give yourself to the light as I have, or suffer as all who stand against our holy cause must. Now begone!~ [BD43556]
@43557 = ~And here is your feather. Now, assuming there is nothing else I can do for you, be on your way. My work requires concentration.~ [BD43557]
@43558 = ~Have you any other items for sale?~
@43559 = ~Are you the magician who designed the spellstone that's infecting the inhabitants of Bridgefort?~
@43560 = ~You are clearly a magician of great skill and power. I assume you fashioned the spellstone currently draining the lives of those in Bridgefort? I want that stopped. Give me the scroll you used to create it, now.~
@43561 = ~No. We're done.~
@43562 = ~Then leave me. I must meditate.~
@43563 = ~Do I look like a merchant to you? I am a researcher and spellcaster, not a trader.~
@43564 = ~You threaten Vichand? Red Wizard of Thay, first son of Orannias, vizier to monarchs, disciple of the Shining Lady, and master of the one true element?~
@43565 = ~I am wholly unfamiliar with nearly all of those things.~
@43566 = ~Count yourself lucky I have better things to do than crush insects right now.~
@43567 = ~Here is the feather. Now begone, lest I change my mind and smear you 'neath my heel like the bug you are.~
@43568 = ~This is the scroll that I used to create the spellstone. Any spellcaster of even moderate skill can use it to nullify the negative energy field.~ [BD43568]
@43569 = ~I have given you what you want. Now please, just go.~
@43570 = ~You have dealt with me fairly. I will pay you the same courtesy. Farewell.~
@43571 = ~I seek a feather from a planetar wing. Do you have one, by any chance?~
@43572 = ~I trust you're not so suicidal as to try to alert the crusade to my presence once I leave your sight. I am a vengeful <PRO_MANWOMAN>, and my reach is very long.~
@43573 = ~Right after I cast a little sleep spell.~
@43574 = ~And let you alert the entire camp to my presence? Do you think me a fool?~
@43575 = ~Deceiver! I gave you what you asked for, and this is how I am repaid? Face the wrath of Vichand, first son of the County Orange!~
@43576 = ~Better to sleep than to die. Cast your spell.~
@43577 = ~Just leave me in peace and I'll be more than happy to do the same for you. Now go.~
@43578 = ~Intruder! There is an intruder in the camp! To arms, crusaders, we are under attack!~
@43579 = ~You'll forgive me if I do not bid you to fare well. In fact, I would take great pleasure in seeing you fare ill.~
@43580 = ~<CHARNAME>. P-please tell me you have the s-scroll. More and more p-people are feeling the effects of the spellstone. I do not th-think we can last much longer. ~
@43581 = ~I've got it. The crusade's craven attempt to lay you low nears its end.~
@43582 = ~I'm afraid I couldn't find it.~
@43583 = ~You won't have to. I got the scroll.~
@43584 = ~You're going to have to. I haven't gotten the scroll yet.~
@43585 = ~It's over. I do not have the scroll.~
@43586 = ~Thank the g-gods. Quickly, t-take it to the spellstone.~
@43587 = ~All will be well, Khalid. I swear it.~
@43588 = ~Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Even without the spellstone, there's plenty of troubles ahead.~
@43589 = ~Ah! All is lost!~
@43590 = ~Do not despair, my friend. I've not given up hope yet, and neither should you.~
@43591 = ~It will be if we don't do something immediately. Gather your people, Khalid. We're taking the battle to the crusade.~
@43592 = ~Perhaps, perhaps not. With your permission, Khalid, I'd like to try negotiating with the crusaders. Perhaps I can find a way out of this quandary.~
@43593 = ~If that is your attitude, then you truly are lost.~
@43594 = ~It's h-hard to hold onto hope when you see your p-p-people dying in front of you. But I sh-shall try.~
@43595 = ~I do not want my people to die—not l-l-like this. Follow m-me.~
@43596 = ~Better to die in battle than waste away.~
@43597 = ~You have the scroll?~ [BD43597]
@43598 = ~I do.~
@43599 = ~Here it is.~
@43600 = ~How much is it worth to you?~
@43601 = ~I do. Baeloth, if you'd be so kind as to negate the stone's effects?~
@43602 = ~That, and someone who knows how to use it. Edwin?~
@43603 = ~Yes. Dynaheir, could you please put an end to this dark magic once and for all.~
@43604 = ~Hand it over, then, unless you know what to do with it. ~
@43605 = ~I believe I can.~
@43606 = ~Here it is.~
@43607 = ~Slow down there. We need to talk about how much this scroll is worth first.~
@43608 = ~Do it, then. We've suffered enough.~
@43609 = ~Good. Stand back.~
@43610 = ~It is done.~
@43611 = ~More than your life, you greed-addled thickwit. Hand it over.~
@43612 = ~Here, take it.~
@43613 = ~The question is how much YOUR lives are worth.~
@43614 = ~You are weak from exposure to the spellstone. I am a patient <PRO_MANWOMAN>, but my patience is limited.~
@43615 = ~You would risk our lives to line your pockets?~
@43616 = ~No, of course not. Here, take it.~
@43617 = ~Less lining than filling. These are people's lives we're talking about.~
@43618 = ~I would sacrifice anyone's life if it were to my benefit.~
@43619 = ~It would be my mildly put-upon pleasure.~ [BD43619]
@43620 = ~If I can cross Vichand any way, I bless myself every way.~
@43621 = ~As thou wish'st it.~ [BD43621]
@43622 = ~I won't let the hero of Baldur's Gate become the doom of Bridgefort. Kill <PRO_HIMHER>! Get the scroll, whatever the cost!~
@43623 = ~No! Do not finish that spell—~
@43624 = ~Blast. This will be most unpleasant.~
@43625 = ~What is that—?~ [BD43625]
@43626 = ~That noise... What is that noise?~
@43627 = ~Vichand built a defense mechanism into the spellstone for instances such as this! Canceling the leech field releases a negative energy wraith!~
@43628 = ~A dark wraith!~ [BD43628]
@43629 = ~You did right by us, <CHARNAME>. For that, I thank you.~ [BD43629]
@43630 = ~It was a privilege, sir. We're all in this together.~
@43631 = ~It was nothing. Well, not nothing, in truth it was quite a bit. But sacrifices have to be made, sometimes.~
@43632 = ~Well done, hero. With your attack on the crusaders as a distraction, I was able to find a copy of the scroll and deactivate the spellstone. We're all safe now.~
@43633 = ~Caelar wants this fort to fall. I would see it stand, just to spite her. I do not need your thanks, nor do I want them.~
@43634 = ~You're right about that. I must continue fortifying our mystical defenses. Until we cross paths again, fare well.~
@43635 = ~Eh? Oh yes, the scroll. I've been meaning to talk to Jegg about that. It says, "Kill blacksmith if not already dead. Use solvent to destroy forge. -H”.~
@43636 = ~Jegg?~
@43637 = ~So an agent of the crusade is within Bridgefort's walls. Most disturbing. I think it best we keep this between us—we don't want this spy to know we're onto them. I'll talk to the blacksmith.~
@43638 = ~Interesting. Thank you for the information, Master Hess.~
@43639 = ~Jegg Hillcarver. She's served as the fort's blacksmith since her husband was slain by the crusade. You must have seen her forge—it's right across from my chamber.~
@43640 = ~I have seen it. Best we keep this between us for now—we don't want this crusade agent to learn we know they're here. I'll go talk to Jegg.~
@43641 = ~The message was intercepted by a man named Roark—it didn't reach its intended target. Mistress Hillcarver might be safe... but I think I'd better alert her to the threat regardless.~
@43642 = ~The crusade wants to eliminate the smith, eh? An interesting development.~
@43643 = ~I've no stomach for this sort of chicanery, so I'll leave you to it. Farewell.~
@43644 = ~Perhaps not so interesting. The message was intercepted by Roark, was it not? So the spy never got it. All should be well.~
@43645 = ~Even so, I think I'd best speak with the blacksmith.~
@43646 = ~I hadn't thought of that. You're right, we have nothing to fear.~
@43647 = ~You are too blase. One message was intercepted; another may have reached its intended destination. Stay alert. At a minimum, we know an enemy walks among us.~
@43648 = ~Nothing on this side of Bridgefort's walls, at any rate. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd best return to doing what I can to ensure that remains the case. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@43649 = ~No? Well, you've got them all the same. Good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you.~
@43650 = ~Where is Frair Tajik?~
@43651 = ~Uuuhhh...~
@43652 = ~Fetch Frair Tajik! This man needs healing!~
@43653 = ~Perhaps I can be of assistance.~
@43654 = ~I can help him.~
@43655 = ~What happened to him?~
@43656 = ~Are you a cleric? ~
@43657 = ~I am.~
@43658 = ~I have healing potions.~
@43659 = ~No, but I've got the best elements of clerics in a bottle, without any of the fussy, judgmental "praise be to the gods" stuff.~
@43660 = ~I can help the man—if the price is right.~
@43661 = ~Help him, then! ~
@43662 = ~Very well.~
@43663 = ~Give me some space. I shall heal him.~
@43664 = ~How much is my help worth to you?~
@43665 = ~This man is hurt and you want payment? You disgust me.~
@43666 = ~Thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. For a moment, I thought Roark was done for.~
@43667 = ~Calm yourself, Callan. I will help Roark.~
@43668 = ~A crusade slinger got a lucky shot. Roark took a bullet to the head and fell from the battlements. Will he be all right?~
@43669 = ~Gods! I feel terrible. Which, I must admit, is a considerable improvement over how I felt a minute ago. Thank you. ~
@43670 = ~Think nothing of it. What happened to you?~
@43671 = ~What happened? Are we facing a crusade assault?~
@43672 = ~I don't want your thanks. Return to your post. Defend Bridgefort from the crusade.~
@43673 = ~Enough talking. Get back to your job.~
@43674 = ~Are the c-crusade moving on the fort again?~
@43675 = ~No, no. One of them had a lucky shot with a sling, nothing more.~
@43676 = ~I think perhaps the crusaders weren't so lucky after all. Take a look at the bullet that hit Roark.~
@43677 = ~There's a scroll wrapped 'round it...~
@43678 = ~What d-does does it say?~
@43679 = ~What is that, a message wrapped 'round the stone? What does it say?~
@43680 = ~I can't read the language. Can you?~
@43681 = ~That's no language. I know a code when I see one, and I'm looking at one right now. Unfortunately, it's beyond my ability to decipher.~
@43682 = ~It's not a language. It's a code, used by bards to pass bits of gossip back and forth in secret.~
@43683 = ~No. Give me the scroll; I'll try to find someone who can.~
@43684 = ~Damn it, man. I'm a <PRO_CLASS>, not a scribe!~
@43685 = ~I've no interest in reading it. I have more important things to do.~
@43686 = ~Perhaps W-wynan Hess can make s-s-s-sense of it. He's the wisest m-man in Bridgefort by a wide margin. He sh-should be in the fort's l-lower level.~

@43692 = ~Aye. I'll do that.~

@43738 = ~Your humility does you a disservice. You know your value is far greater than most of these sheep.~
@43739 = ~Have they indeed? Well, let them come. I'd welcome a fight with any crusader that tries to cross me. ~
@43740 = ~As would I, but we do not know who will come for you—Caelar has an agent operating within our walls.~
@43741 = ~We are of one blood. I share your feelings. But we're not talking about a fight here—we're talking about an assassination. If you don't do what I tell you, you will die.~
@43742 = ~There's a spy within these walls, an assassin whose next target is you. If we give them the chance to attack you, the odds are you won't get the chance to fight.~
@43743 = ~I share the sentiment, but I doubt a spy is going to give you a fair fight.~
@43744 = ~You think an assassin would give you a fighting chance? Are you truly so foolish?~
@43745 = ~So what would you have me do? ~
@43746 = ~The spy's been told to destroy the forge as well as you. Tell everyone you're going to get some sleep, then hide in yon room. I have a potion of invisibility. I'll wait here for the spy to make their move, then strike.~
@43747 = ~The spy's been told to destroy the forge as well as you. Tell everyone you're going to get some sleep, then take cover in yon room. I'll lurk, watching over the forge. When the spy strikes, so will I.~
@43748 = ~Be on your guard. That is all you can do, I fear.~
@43749 = ~Do as you will. You know of the danger now. Forewarned is forearmed.~
@43750 = ~Aye, well. Thanks for that. Now be off with you, I've work to do.~
@43751 = ~Have a care. Those sheep are my friends.~
@43752 = ~I will do as you say. But: This was my husband's forge. He worked on it every day for nigh on two decades. You're a dwarf. You know what that means. Take care of it.~
@43753 = ~You want me to leave someone I barely know to watch over my forge? That's not going to happen.~
@43754 = ~Very well. I have another potion of invisibility. We'll watch for the spy together. My friends will hide.~
@43755 = ~Nothing's happened! This insulting lump got me worked up over some nonsense about an assassin.~
@43756 = ~Very well. You take the potion, and I'll cloak myself in shadows. We'll await the traitor together.~
@43757 = ~Damn it! This isn't just your life we're talking about—everyone in this fort is depending on you!~

@43760 = ~I will do as you say. But: This was my husband's forge. He worked on it every day for nigh on two decades. If anything happens to it, you'll have more to worry about than a crusade assassin. Got it? Good.~

@43779 = ~Nothing. She's doing nothing.~
@43780 = ~Hm. ~
@43781 = ~Are you here, smith? I have some work I need done.~
@43782 = ~It's him! He's the spy, I know it!~

@43784 = ~You are really tremendously bad at this, you know that?~
@43785 = ~Stop moving your lips or I'll cut them from you face, you hideous grotesque!~

@43788 = ~It's me, Jegg Hillcarver.~
@43789 = ~Smith? Anyone? Are you here?~

@43792 = ~Nothing. No meaning.~

@43796 = ~Aye, that's what I said. Forget this wearisome scold. What can I do for you?~
@43797 = ~Ahhh, forget this wearisome scold. What can I do for you?~
@43798 = ~As I said, I have a weapon in need of repair.~
@43799 = ~Perhaps I was wrong—perhaps there is no spy. Forgive me for taking up your time, Mistress Hillcarver.~
@43800 = ~Well, that was time well spent.~
@43801 = ~You've wasted valuable time and resources, dwarf. I should kill you myself.~
@43802 = ~You've wasted my time and resources. I should kill you myself.~
@43803 = ~And so you should be. Push off; I've actual important things to take care of.~

@43810 = ~If there's ever anything I can do for you, just say the word.~
@43811 = ~A generous offer. I hope I never need to take you up on it, but I'll keep it in mind.~
@43812 = ~Actually, there is something you might be able to help me with. I acquired these shards from the spellstone the crusade hit us with. They clearly have magical qualities—would it be possible to incorporate them into a weapon of some sort?~
@43813 = ~Maybe there is something you can do for me. Let's take a look at your wares, shall we?~
@43814 = ~It was a pleasure saving your life. I'll see you again soon, I'm sure.~

@43822 = ~Oh, you want to call in the favor now? Guess I can't really complain, I did offer... Here, take your pick.~
@43823 = ~Aye, aye. I'll do that. Just said I would, didn't I?~
@43824 = ~Farewell.~
@43825 = ~Hey there, I heard you saved us all from certain death. S'pose I'm obliged to you for that. Is there anything I can do for you? Weapons you need? Armor?~
@43826 = ~A generous offer. I'll keep it in mind.~
@43827 = ~Would you be able to make M'Khiin a set of armor? I'm having trouble finding a suit that fits her.~
@43828 = ~Actually, there is something you might be able to help me with. I acquired these stone shards not too long ago. They clearly have magical qualities—I was wondering if you might be able to incorporate them into a weapon of some sort?~

@43830 = ~Now that is something I'd like to see.~
@43831 = ~Make sure you remember this <DAYNIGHTALL> if I should ever happen to call upon you.~

@43833 = ~I'll get right on it.~
@43834 = ~Many thanks, Missus Hillcarver. I'll take my leave now.~
@43835 = ~That's M'Khiin sorted out. Let's see what else you've got available.~
@43836 = ~Forget the goblin. Let's see what else you've got.~
@43837 = ~Forget the goblin. Everyone else does.~ [BD43837]
@43838 = ~Armaments and armor crafted in a genuine dwarven forge!~
@43839 = ~Now give me a few hours. I'll have something for you then.~
@43840 = ~How goes it, <CHARNAME>? ~
@43841 = ~Well enough, Mistress Hillcarver. And you?~
@43842 = ~You know how it is, Jegg. I shouldn't complain. But I will, just to keep in practice. How does this <DAYNIGHTALL> find you?~
@43843 = ~Tolerably well, though it'd be better if M'Khiin's armor were finished.~
@43844 = ~The crusade tries to wear me down, but I still stand. Have you managed to make anything of those black stones I gave you?~
@43845 = ~No time for chat, Jegg. Let me see what you've got available in the way of arms.~
@43846 = ~Not so well as it was before you started talking to me.~
@43847 = ~Could be better, could be substantially worse. ~
@43848 = ~It's good to keep things in perspective.~
@43849 = ~I know that feeling. May I see what arms you have available at the moment?~
@43850 = ~From your mouth to the gods' ears. Have you managed to make anything of those black stones I gave you?~
@43851 = ~It surely will be, ere this is over. I'll leave you to your business now.~
@43852 = ~I'm busy slaving away on your goblin's armor. Not done yet, but making progress. ~
@43853 = ~I shall leave you to it.~
@43854 = ~You needn't bother. M'Khiin no longer accompanies me.~
@43855 = ~Fair enough. May I see what else you have available at the moment?~
@43856 = ~Make it faster. I'll check in with you later.~
@43857 = ~Of course, of course. Here, take a look.~
@43858 = ~Is there anything I can do for you?~
@43859 = ~No, no. I just wanted to check in, make sure you were doing all right after that business with Roark.~
@43860 = ~I was hoping you might help me with something. I acquired these stone shards not too long ago. They clearly have magical qualities—could you incorporate them into a weapon of some sort?~
@43861 = ~Would that you could, my lady.~
@43862 = ~I want nothing from you, now or ever.~
@43863 = ~Ah— My, those are... disturbing, aren't they? Leave them with me—I'll see what I can do for you. ~
@43864 = ~Thank you.~
@43865 = ~Actually, I believe I'll hang onto them a little longer.~
@43866 = ~Leave them with you? I think not.~
@43867 = ~Anything else I can do for you? ~
@43868 = ~No, I believe that's it. I'll check back in later.~
@43869 = ~I'd like to take a look at what items you've currently got available, if I may.~
@43870 = ~That will do for now. Take care.~
@43871 = ~Aye. Aye, do that. I'll see you soon.~
@43872 = ~Well, I appreciate that. As I said, I've been better, but I'd be even worse were it not for you. Take care, <CHARNAME>. We'll speak again soon, I'm sure.~
@43873 = ~I'll leave you to go about your business then.~
@43874 = ~Bloody pilgarlic...~
@43875 = ~I'll leave you to go about your business then.~
@43876 = ~<CHARNAME>, I appreciate it and all, but I'm no lady of the court. Call me Jegg. Take care of yourself, you hear me?~
@43877 = ~Yep! Ruined three hammers working them in, but I did it in the end. Here.~
@43878 = ~Hope it's something you can use. Is there anything else I can do for you?~
@43879 = ~No, I believe that's it.~
@43880 = ~I'd like to take a look at what items you've currently got available, if I may.~
@43881 = ~That will do for now. ~
@43882 = ~Yes, yes, yes! The goblin's armor is complete. Here, see for yourself.~
@43883 = ~Feels like I'm trapped in a pile of swords. Don't like it.~
@43884 = ~Better a sword on the outside than the inside. You'll get used to it.~
@43885 = ~Guess so.~
@43886 = ~Oh, aye? Good move, dropping that one. You can never trust a goblin.~

@43890 = ~Murs~
@43891 = ~Blind Albino Wyrmlings

I could try to find the source of the screams from the underground caverns.

According to Murs, west and south of the old ogre settlement, screams can be heard coming from the cavern walls, as if something were trapped inside the rocks.~
@43892 = ~The Lost

I should watch for ghosts in the underground caverns.

Murs told me ghosts haunt a cavern west and north of the old ogre settlement.~
@43893 = ~Dark Druid Circle

Murs warned me that dark druids claim a territory far to the west and south of the old ogre settlement.~
@43894 = ~Accessing the Warrens

I need to find the access point to the underground caverns, north and west of here.

Murs told me I can gain entry to the caverns directly beneath Dragonspear far to the west and north of the ogres' old settlement.~

@43896 = ~Water Elemental~
@43897 = ~Nereid~
@43898 = ~There's no time to waste. We'll start for Bridgefort as soon as the camp is struck.~
@43899 = ~I'll do that.~
@43900 = ~Sounds good.~ [BD43900]
@43901 = ~And watch your back. It's possible some crusaders were left on this side of the Winding Water.~
@43902 = ~Something exploded, that's what happened. We'll need to cross the Winding Water over Boareskyr Bridge.~
@43903 = ~There's no time to waste. We'll leave as soon as the camp is struck.~
@43904 = ~I'll do that.~
@43905 = ~Sounds good.~
@43906 = ~Watch your back. It's possible some crusaders were left on this side of the Winding Water.~
@43907 = ~It's been too long since I saw him last. How is he?~
@43908 = ~Good.~
@43909 = ~I'll let him tell you himself. Follow me.~
@43910 = ~Come on, then.~
@43911 = ~I shall grieve for her when this is o-over. Until then, these people need me. But surely you had another purpose in coming here?~
@43912 = ~First I'd like to know what you're doing here.~
@43913 = ~I do. I am accompanied a Flaming Fist company from Baldur's Gate. We're here to liberate Bridgefort, then move on to Dragonspear Castle.~
@43914 = ~This place is a step on my path to annihilate Caelar Argent and her so-called "crusade."~
@43915 = ~"Who're you?" What kind of talk is that? "Who goes there?", that's what a guard says. The answer is <CHARNAME>. I'm here to help you.~
@43916 = ~The real question is how I shall leave. The answer is over the crusaders' corpses. Lower the drawbridge. We're taking the battle to the crusade.~
@43917 = ~Khalid, you can't allow this.~
@43918 = ~<CHARNAME> is right. We can wait n-no longer. The b-attle for Bridgefort starts now.~
@43919 = ~Lower the drawbridge. We're taking the battle to the crusade. Now.~
@43920 = ~Do I know you?~
@43921 = ~Half the length of a snapped longbow protrudes from the mud of the underground lake's shore, the bowstring still attached to the lower limb lying an arm's length away.~

@43925 = ~I plan to. But before I do, I would know everything there is to know about Caelar.~
@43926 = ~I like to think I'm useful in a variety of ways. Not all of them require me to go underground.~
@43927 = ~I do as I will, where I will, Torsin. Do not cross me.~
@43928 = ~Intelligence collection is a continuing effort. We know she is an Argent, and that her family was held in great esteem within the Order of the Aster. It took some digging, but we've learned Caelar was raised at one of the Aster's compounds.~ [BD43928]
@43929 = ~Intriguing. Thank you.~
@43930 = ~The Order of the Aster?~
@43931 = ~The Argents were held in great esteem? But no longer?~
@43932 = ~Considering what she's accomplished, she must have learned their lessons well.~

@43934 = ~Is she still a member of the Order of the Aster?~
@43935 = ~Ah yes. I've heard of them.~
@43936 = ~How did a soldier of the Morninglord come to claim she serves the will of all the gods?~
@43937 = ~I've encountered several of her followers. They are zealots and some are mighty warriors, but they are no paladins.~
@43938 = ~She no longer has any association with the order. As far as we can determine, there was an incident of some sort. Caelar was little more than a child at the time, but her name was struck from the Order's records, and she was cast out.~ [BD43938]
@43939 = ~I'll have to ask her what happened when I face her. Thank you for the information.~
@43940 = ~Do we know anything of this incident?~
@43941 = ~So she's no friend to her former order. Do you know how she came to develop the belief system she espouses now?~
@43942 = ~Do we know what she did after she was cast out?~
@43943 = ~No. After she left the Order, she seems to have vanished. What she was up to during the intervening years is a mystery.~ [BD43943]
@43944 = ~Few seem to know what happened, and those who do are spread out across Faerûn, beyond our reach in any practical sense. We believe it's significant that an uncle of hers, Aun Argent, vanishes from the official record around the same time Caelar was cast out. Unlike his niece, the order holds Aun in the highest regard.~ [BD43944]
@43945 = ~Thanks. You've been most helpful.~
@43946 = ~Mystery piles upon mystery. Do you know what happened between her leaving the Order of the Aster and her reappearance?~
@43947 = ~So she slew her uncle...~
@43948 = ~Don't jump to conclusions. We don't know why she was expelled from the Order, nor do we know what happened between her banishing and the commencement of her crusade.~ [BD43948]
@43949 = ~I suspect it involves her advisor, the so-called "Revered Brother" Hephernaan. As you are already aware, we know little of him.~ [BD43949]
@43950 = ~Thanks. You've been very informative.~
@43951 = ~There's always a power behind the throne. We'd do well to learn more of this Hephernaan.~
@43952 = ~Tell me again what you know of Caelar.~
@43953 = ~I know enough. He will share the same fate as his mistress.~
@43954 = ~Charming. I suppose I should expect no better from a representative of Baldur's Gate, a city of pirates and other criminal scum. Go, get out of here. Do your damned job!~ [BD43954]
@43955 = ~I am less concerned with Caelar's past than her future, which I hope to see abbreviated in the most efficient manner possible. Now, be about your business.~ [BD43955]

@43972 = ~You gather correctly.~ [BD43972]
@43973 = ~If you see her, tell her to seek me out, please. It was one thing to torment her on the journey here, but if she were killed or fell into enemy hands, Duke Silvershield would be... displeased.~ [BD43973]

@43985 = ~And now I shall walk away. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~

@43992 = ~Sober still, I'm sad to say. Will it last?~

@43994 = ~You don't like him, I take it.~
@43995 = ~Tell me a tale, General Stonehand.~
@43996 = ~A story I'd rather not hear at this time. Farewell.~
@43997 = ~He's a coward. I hate to say it, but there it is. We could have—we SHOULD have taken Dragonspear when we first arrived. Redblooding Caelar was out in the High Moor then, doing gods know what. The castle would've fallen faster than a house of cards.~ [BD43997]
@43998 = ~That seems like it would have been a tactically sound move.~
@43999 = ~He prevented you from taking the castle?~
@44000 = ~You and Nederlok couldn't bring him around?~
@44001 = ~This whole mess keeps getting messier because de Lancie refuses to commit to any action that carries the slightest risk. What kind of commander is that?~ [BD44001]
@44002 = ~One I'm less than comfortable serving under. Thank you, general, you've been most helpful. Farewell.~
@44003 = ~How did such a man come to be a torsin?~
@44004 = ~Not the sort you want when faced with an adversary such as Caelar. But you and Nederlok have some influence over him, surely?~
@44005 = ~One more accustomed to bureaucracy than combat.~
@44006 = ~I've heard enough. Farewell.~
@44007 = ~His father, the earl of de Lancie, handed him his rank, same as everything else in his life. He's in over his head now, terrified of making the wrong move, so he does nothing. Which is the wrongest move that can be made.~ [BD44007]
@44008 = ~I'm here now. And I'll not stand still and wait for Caelar to act. We'll speak more of this when I return from the caverns. Farewell, General Stonehand.~
@44009 = ~Surely you and Nederlok have some influence over him?~
@44010 = ~Enough. My suspicion that de Lancie isn't worthy to lead has been confirmed. You have my thanks. Farewell, General.~
@44011 = ~He's had us sitting here twiddling our thumbs for weeks. First he wants to "thoroughly reconnoiter" the castle. Then he wants to wait for further troops. Then the Champion of Baldur's Gate has to be here before we can do anything. Now he wants to wait till you...~
@44012 = ~He's had us twiddling our thumbs for weeks. First he wants to "thoroughly reconnoiter" the castle. Then wait for further troops. Then the hero of Baldur's Gate has to be here before we can do anything. Now he wants to hold till you finish your business in the caverns.~ [BD44012]
@44013 = ~I understand. I don't like it myself, but we do what we must.~
@44014 = ~The risk averse make poor leaders. It's always easier to do nothing than something.~
@44015 = ~I'll conclude that business as quickly as possible. Then Torsin de Lancie and I will have a... frank discussion about our overall strategy.~
@44016 = ~You got that right. Getting spanked by his nanny's the closest he's ever been to a fight.~ [BD44016]
@44017 = ~Haha! That'll be the day. Now that you've arrived, Nederlok commands a hundred and twenty mercenaries. I have less than fifty. De Lancie? He's got more than three hundred under him, and he don't want to risk a single one.~ [BD44017]
@44018 = ~Bloody hells, we've got ourselves another Torsin de Lancie.~ [BD44018]
@44019 = ~As you say. I'll leave you to your business then. Watch your back.~ [BD44019]
@44020 = ~Aye. Axes high an' all that.~
@44021 = ~It's the hero of Baldur's Gate! Pass, friend.~
@44022 = ~Well met, hero. ~
@44023 = ~Be careful if you leave camp. The woods are dangerous.~
@44024 = ~Watch your back, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. You wouldn't want the crusade getting the drop on you. ~
@44025 = ~Best stay in the camp. It's safest there. ~
@44026 = ~The crusade's up to something. I'm sure of it.~
@44027 = ~Good to see you.~
@44028 = ~Damn that Caelar. I'm freezing my nethers off out here. ~
@44029 = ~Beware the crusade. They're sneaky little buggers. And enthusiastic.~
@44030 = ~All right. Let's find Skie and get out of here.~ [BD44030]
@44031 = ~I just hope we aren't too late. If the crusade gets their hands on her, our task becomes that much harder.~
@44032 = ~Let's not rush back to the camp too soon. We may be able to learn something useful observing our enemies.~
@44033 = ~Agreed. Skie Silvershield knows too much. Caelar can't be allowed to get her.~
@44034 = ~You say that like we haven't troubles enough...~ [BD44034]
@44035 = ~We should scout the outside of the castle first—no point risking our lives trying to get in if she's skulking out here. Let's go.~
@44036 = ~I've ob-observed the crusade enough for th-this lifetime.~
@44037 = ~There is a time to watch and a time to do battle. This is one of those times.~ [BD44037]
@44038 = ~We'll see what we see, but getting Silvershield's daughter is our priority.~
@44039 = ~Agreed.~
@44040 = ~I'll decide on my own priorities.~
@44041 = ~Let's go.~
@44042 = ~Damn it, <CHARNAME>. You just can't make it easy, can you? All right, we play it your way—as usual.~
@44043 = ~There's but one way to ensure that doesn't happen—if it's not already too late.~ [BD44043]
@44044 = ~Halt! Friend or foe? ~
@44045 = ~Fear not. I am a friend.~
@44046 = ~How can I know that? We've not even met yet.~
@44047 = ~I hold in my hand the seal of Caelar Argent. What do you think?~
@44048 = ~I'm a good friend to have and a foe you really don't want.~
@44049 = ~Threats mean little to we who stand in the light of the Caelar. What business have you here?~
@44050 = ~I seek entry to Dragonspear.~
@44051 = ~I would speak with your mistress.~
@44052 = ~I was merely passing by, and will continue to do so if it's all the same to you. Farewell.~
@44053 = ~Caelar's light protects me from all evil. Begone!~
@44054 = ~None but those who walk in the Shining Lady's light may pass through here. Do you carry Caelar's seal?~
@44055 = ~I do not—not yet. I would fight under her banner—I understand her crusade welcomes new recruits?~
@44056 = ~Have no fears, my friend. I too walk in the light. I was a lost soul, bereft of hope, when she found me. She raised me up. I was transformed. Now I want nothing but to serve her in whatever fashion she sees fit.~
@44057 = ~I do. I carry it with me at all times. See it here?~
@44058 = ~Stand aside or I'll snuff your light out as surely as I will your heretic mistress's!~
@44059 = ~Let me take a closer look at that...~
@44060 = ~Forgive me, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I did not know you were one of the faithful. Please, pass. May Caelar's light shine upon you always.~
@44061 = ~I fear nothing. I do the will of the gods. What do you want here?~
@44062 = ~I seek entry to Dragonspear.~
@44063 = ~Let me pass. I serve the Shining Lady, just as you do. Look, I carry her seal.~
@44064 = ~The will of the gods? You truly believe that nonsense?~
@44065 = ~Let me pass, or I'll give you something to fear.~
@44066 = ~Mock me if you must. When Dragonspear gives up its dead, all will see the light. Now begone!~
@44067 = ~Without the seal of Caelar, you shall not pass. Begone!~
@44068 = ~What—? Oh, <CHARNAME>, it's you. ~
@44069 = ~What is this, <CHARNAME>? What are you doing here?~ [BD44069]
@44070 = ~What are YOU doing here?~
@44071 = ~I'm looking for you. What the hells, Skie?~
@44072 = ~Wasting my time looking for you. Get back to the camp.~
@44073 = ~I'm spying on Dragonspear, watching the crusaders for weaknesses we can exploit.~ [BD44073]
@44074 = ~What have you learned?~
@44075 = ~Who told you to do that?~
@44076 = ~I don't care what you think you're doing. Get back to the camp.~
@44077 = ~But there's nothing to DO at the camp!~ [BD44077]
@44078 = ~You do more than you know simply by being there. You are an inspiration to all the Flaming Fist. They look upon you and know what they are fighting for.~
@44079 = ~You'll be safe there, Skie. Please, just go back.~
@44080 = ~There's little to do here other than get killed needlessly and invite your father's wrath on people who don't deserve it. GO.~
@44081 = ~This is no game, Skie Silvershield. Get back to the camp before the crusaders kill you or I swear by all the gods I'll kill you myself.~
@44082 = ~You know, when my dad was my age he took his unit into a den of wyverns and killed them all so the nearby farms would be safe.~ [BD44082]
@44083 = ~They're just as boring as the Flaming Fist. All they do is work and pray. The most interesting thing I saw was them shoring up a section of wall to the west. And that was not interesting AT ALL.~ [BD44083]
@44084 = ~Well done, Skie. This is usable intelligence. Now it's time for you to return to the camp. You're too valuable an asset to risk losing.~
@44085 = ~I know you had the best intentions, Skie. But you must return to the camp now. You're not safe here.~
@44086 = ~That might actually be useful. Good work. Now you should return to the camp.~
@44087 = ~The crusade isn't here for your entertainment. Stop acting like a child and get back to the camp.~
@44088 = ~I did good...? Really? I mean, yeah, of course. I knew that would be important.~ [BD44088]
@44089 = ~They don't even know who I am.~ [BD44089]
@44090 = ~It matters not. Beauty and nobility shine from your every pore. They may not know your name or station, but they know YOU, I assure you.~
@44091 = ~They've been instructed to pretend they don't. I promise you, your absence has not gone unnoticed—rather, it is causing serious distress. You must return, so the Fist and our allies can once again focus on the enemy.~
@44092 = ~They know your type well enough. Now get back to the camp.~
@44093 = ~When my dad was my age, he was already a hero. No one thinks I can be a hero too, but they're wrong. I'm glad YOU at least see that I've got something to offer. Take care, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD44093]
@44094 = ~No one told me to do it. I'm taking the initiative.~ [BD44094]
@44095 = ~Soldiers don't take the initiative. They follow orders. Return to the camp.~
@44096 = ~Please. What really happened? Did you get a blister on your hand? Stub your toe? Did you even think to concoct a plausible rationale for your actions, or did you just abandon your post the second it occurred to you?~
@44097 = ~You're risking your life for no good reason.~
@44098 = ~I got TWO blisters. Who lives like this?~ [BD44098]
@44099 = ~The soldiers of the Flaming Fist. Which you joined of your own free will. Please, return to the camp. People are worried about you.~
@44100 = ~You do, for the time being. Nobody asked for you to come here, Skie—you chose to do so. Now you must live with that decision. Go back to the camp, Bence is worried about you.~
@44101 = ~Blisters will be the least of your worries if the crusade gets hold of you, you self-absorbed brat. Return to the camp, now.~
@44102 = ~No good reason? I'll give you a reason—I am Skie Silvershield, not the scullery maid the Fist would have me be. I'm not supposed to peel potatoes.~ [BD44102]
@44103 = ~I'm sure they do. Come on now, back to the camp with you. Let's go.~ [BD44103]
@44104 = ~And that's why you never become a soldier. Best do as our friend says, Mistress Silvershield.~ [BD44104]
@44105 = ~The princess shies away from common labor? I'm shocked.~ [BD44105]
@44106 = ~I feel ill.~ [BD44106]
@44107 = ~Voghiln has the cure for what ails you, ho ho!~ [BD44107]
@44108 = ~I feel even more ill.~ [BD44108]
@44109 = ~I matter that much? Truly? All right. I'll go back. Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD44109]
@44110 = ~We've better things to do than watch over you, you indolent trollop. Return to the camp.~ [BD44110]
@44111 = ~Speak for yourself, <PRO_RACE>.~
@44112 = ~Surprised to see you here. I thought you'd been sent to penetrate Dragonspear from below.~ [BD44112]
@44113 = ~I'll be heading there soon.~
@44114 = ~A fool's errand. I doubt these supposed caverns even exist.~
@44115 = ~I do not jump and run at Torsin de Lancie or anyone else's command.~
@44116 = ~Some of the commanders will be more comfortable with you out of the camp than in it, but they're not so foolish as to waste your talents. There is a way into the castle beneath Dragonspear. I'm sure of it.~
@44117 = ~Best you take care of the caverns sooner than later. You don't want de Lancie seeing you.~
@44118 = ~Am I really such a terrible distraction?~
@44119 = ~Don't worry about de Lancie. I can handle him.~
@44120 = ~I don't fear Torsin de Lancie.~
@44121 = ~I'm not worried about you. When de Lancie's upset, it's his people who pay the price. Go, do what was asked of you. Don't give him an excuse to piss on good soldiers.~
@44122 = ~Glad to hear it. Don't let me keep you.~
@44123 = ~No one said you did.~
@44124 = ~Word of what happened at Boareskyr Bridge is flying through the camp, and the story changes with every telling. It won't be long before someone claims Bhaal himself appeared and shook your hand. It's making people nervous, and nervous people with weapons and magic are a bad combination.~
@44125 = ~It's making people nervous, and nervous people with weapons and magic are a bad combination, even when the people have been trained to use them.~
@44126 = ~Make yourself scarce for a while. Go to the caverns. By the time you return, the stories will have died down, I'm sure. All right?~
@44127 = ~All right. I'll do as you say.~
@44128 = ~This camp is full of trained soldiers. Flaming Fist mercenaries, members of the Waterdeep city guard. If they have a problem with me, it's no problem of mine.~
@44129 = ~You were asked to do something. I got the impression you agreed to do it. Perhaps I heard wrong. In any event, I've my own business to attend to, so I'll leave you to yours. ~
@44130 = ~<CHARNAME>. What in the hells are you doing here?~ [BD44130]
@44131 = ~Where would you have me be, Corporal Duncan?~
@44132 = ~I'll not be here long. I need some supplies before I begin searching for the caverns that supposedly got run beneath Dragonspear.~
@44133 = ~Who in the hells are you to address me in such a manner?~
@44134 = ~I'd have you be doing what you were told to do where you were told to do it—beneath Dragonspear.~ [BD44134]
@44135 = ~I require some supplies before I embark on my journey.~
@44136 = ~Right, the caverns... Forgot about that. I'll go take care of them right now.~
@44137 = ~De Lancie and the others have no authority over me. I do not jump and run at their beck and call.~
@44138 = ~You're here because the dukes thought you would help the effort. If you can't be bothered, you might as well go back to the Gate.~ [BD44138]
@44139 = ~"Hero," my ass...~ [BD44139]
@44140 = ~Well, be quick about it. The sooner this siege is over, the sooner I get back to Baldur's Gate and my family. And that can't happen soon enough.~ [BD44140]
@44141 = ~Why aren't you in the caverns underneath Dragonspear? You know, where the commanders told you to go?~ [BD44141]
@44142 = ~I require some supplies before I embark on my journey.~
@44143 = ~Where they ASKED me to go, you mean? I plan to leave shortly.~
@44144 = ~Nederlok and the others have no authority over me. I do not jump and run at their beck and call.~
@44145 = ~See that you do. The sooner the siege ends, the sooner I see my family again. And that can't happen soon enough.~ [BD44145]
@44146 = ~Aye, right. No more, no less, yet you go where you will, when you will, and I'm stuck here, thirsty and eyes dry from watching for crusaders.~

@44345 = ~Growing weary, you set down for the night. As you drift into sleep, a sudden chill falls over you. Your eyes open, and you are not where you were.

You stand upon a lake of ice. The lake stretches into a haze in every direction, with no shoreline visible. Below, you can make out the form of a terrifying abomination roving along the lake bed, consumed with hatred and malice. It cannot break through the ice to reach you. You are immune to the beast's impotent rage, shielded from its fury.

On the horizon, the sun begins to rise. As it rises, it grows brighter... then brighter still. You try to shield your eyes from its radiance to no avail. Its brilliant light burns your eyes, and you are struck blind. 

An ear-splitting crack fills the air. The ice beneath you rumbles and shifts. You feel yourself falling, but before you land, you awake.~
@44346 = ~You are on a small raft, drifting over the waters of an unknown sea. For a time, all is calm. The rhythmic slap of the waves against the raft and the prickling of the saltwater air is even pleasurable.

Then the sky begins to darken. Gentle winds grow stronger. Caught in a sudden storm, you cling to the raft as it's tossed wildly about. The waters around you turn black, then red. A familiar scent fills your nostrils. You are floating on a sea of blood.

A bolt of lightning slices down from the darkened sky. It strikes your raft, blasting it to splinters. As you sink beneath waves of blood, you see the dark shapes of buildings, trees, and statues. This land was once above the waves. As you touch the foul sea's bottom, a familiar voice growls in your ear: "Did you think I had left you?" 

You awake.~
@44347 = ~As you toss and turn in your sleep, the feeling that someone is watching you begins to creep across your mind. You rouse yourself, and your suspicions are confirmed.

Imoen sits before you. You can see her, but she cannot see you. She waits back in her quarters at the Ducal Palace, sitting upon her bed, facing away from the locked door.

Someone knocks at her door, but she continues to look forward. The knocking does not stop; it continues, the impacts on the wood growing in volume and force. Soon the entire door shakes from the furious assault on the other side. Imoen continues to stare through you. 

Whatever is on the other side of the door has a sinister intent. You hear growls, whines, and scratching in addition to pounding. You try to warn Imoen, but no sound comes from your mouth. You try to reach out to her, but you cannot move.

Suddenly, the scrabbling stops. A key can be heard unlocking the door. The handle turns, and the door swings open. The inhuman figure beyond the threshold is shrouded in darkness. Imoen does not look at it, but you now see the terror in her eyes. "He will not be ignored," she says. You awaken.~

@44512 = ~Sallo! Any sign of Lord Eldric yet?~
@44513 = ~Not yet, milord. Shall I go down to the common room and look for him?~
@44514 = ~No sign of him yet. I'll run down and see if he's lost.~
@44515 = ~All I see are three traitors who deserve to die.~
@44516 = ~Yes, yes. Hurry back.~
@44517 = ~That isn't Sallo! Quick, silence <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@44518 = ~I do hope Eldric arrives soon.~

@44522 = ~A plot against the Council of Four is being hatched upstairs.~
@44523 = ~Three nobles upstairs mistook me for a mercenary captain named Sallo. Strange, I know. Then they started talking about overthrowing the dukes!~
@44524 = ~Three nobles upstairs are plotting to take over the city. It makes no difference to me, but I thought you might like to know.~
@44525 = ~I found this letter upstairs. It implicates three nobles in this inn of plotting against the dukes of Baldur's Gate.~
@44526 = ~I slew three nobles upstairs. They were plotting against the city. Here, one of them was carrying this note.~
@44527 = ~These conspirators are upstairs right now? I'll summon help and take up position outside their door. You go back up and get them talking about this plot again.~
@44528 = ~Yes, and they're expecting me back any minute.~
@44529 = ~They sure are. Saying unflattering things about me too, I might add.~
@44530 = ~For the moment.~
@44531 = ~I'll summon a squad of Flaming Fist and take positions outside their door. You go back up and get them talking about their plot again. ~
@44532 = ~I understand. I'll meet you upstairs.~
@44533 = ~Very well—but make sure you and the others are ready to move as soon as the nobles reveal their plan.~
@44534 = ~If I must.~
@44535 = ~I'll be there as soon as I can.~
@44536 = ~You head back upstairs. Remember: You have to get the nobles to talk about their treasonous activities.~
@44537 = ~Oh, gods damn it...! All right. I'll round up some Flaming Fist enforcers and arrest the traitors. Thanks for looking after the city's interests. It's appreciated.~
@44538 = ~Thank you for looking after the city's interests. I appreciate your dedication.~
@44539 = ~You should've come to me before taking matters into your own hands.~

@44544 = ~Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I'll see that everything's taken care of.~
@44545 = ~Good, you're here. Any sign of Eldric?~
@44546 = ~Not yet, milord.~
@44547 = ~I didn't see him. You should probably continue your meeting without him.~
@44548 = ~He sent a messenger. It seems he's ill and can't make it, but he says you should proceed without him.~
@44549 = ~How inconvenient... Eldric really knew the best way for us to proceed.~
@44550 = ~Yes. It's all very well to talk about our ideas, our dreams, but we need a plan of action.~
@44551 = ~Perhaps we should reschedule for when Eldric is available?~
@44552 = ~I can't guarantee I'll be around for your next meeting. If you want my assistance, we need to settle this sooner than later.~
@44553 = ~Bad idea. You've already lost the better part of a night. Do you want to lose the rest of it too?~
@44554 = ~I've heard rumors that Lord Eldric is very difficult to schedule around. He's always late and misses half his appointments.~
@44555 = ~We may not have an opportunity like this again for some time...~
@44556 = ~Fine. Forget Eldric. There are things we can do, events we can start in motion without his immediate assistance.~

@44560 = ~"You know who"? Seriously?~

@44564 = ~I see. If you've the coin, I've the people to help you out.~
@44565 = ~The dregs of the Sword Coast fill our streets. Demand for goods is rising, and prices will follow—we'll see to it. You will speak out about the Council's inability to deal with the situation.~
@44566 = ~People will listen to the hero of Baldur's Gate. You will help us topple the Grand Dukes one by one. And we shall be there to take the reins of power.~
@44567 = ~Strange... that isn't like Lord Eldric at all.~
@44568 = ~We're done here. We'll reunite at a later date—in a more private venue.~
@44569 = ~How dare you address us in such a manner? You think us children? How dare you?~
@44570 = ~You scared them off. Subtlety isn't your strong suit, is it?~ [BD44570]
@44571 = ~I'm sorry, I'm not very good at deception.~
@44572 = ~This was your idea, not mine. Don't blame me if it didn't work.~

@44578 = ~We heard everything. You're all in a great deal of trouble.~
@44579 = ~It was all Araya's fault! She put us up to this!~
@44580 = ~WHAT? Don't listen to him; Therton's the real ringleader!~
@44581 = ~The magistrate will sort it out. As for you, <CHARNAME>, you've done us a great service. Take this, and the city's thanks.~
@44582 = ~It was an honor to serve the interests of Baldur's Gate.~
@44583 = ~As long as the city keeps rewarding me, I'll keep serving it.~
@44584 = ~I had little choice but to step in. No one else had competence enough to deal with this plot.~
@44585 = ~Please stop with the flattery, <CHARNAME>. You'll make me blush.~ [BD44585]
@44586 = ~You did good work tonight, <CHARNAME>. Thank you.~ [BD44586]
@44587 = ~Uggggh...~

@44589 = ~Hello? CAN YOU HEAR ME? ~
@44590 = ~What a disgusting sight. On your feet.~
@44591 = ~Better people than you have tried to rouse Sallo when <PRO_HESHE>'s on a bender. Can't be done.~
@44592 = ~I don't think I've seen anyone this drunk before.~
@44593 = ~Looks like this Sallo knows how to have a good time.~
@44594 = ~A pathetic display.~
@44595 = ~Yep, that's our Sallo. Come to think of it, you two look an awful lot alike. Maybe you're long-lost twins?~
@44596 = ~I don't need any more surprise relatives, thanks.~
@44597 = ~Oh, come now, I'm MUCH more attractive.~
@44598 = ~I'm no relation to this drunken pig.~
@44599 = ~Good ol' Sallo.~
@44600 = ~What are you doing in here? This is a private room!~
@44601 = ~Sorry, I didn't know this room was occupied. I'll leave immediately.~
@44602 = ~You should post a guard if you want to keep people out. It's customary around these parts.~
@44603 = ~I go where I wish.~
@44604 = ~My deepest apologies. I heard there was a noblewoman here who might be interested in my anti-aging magic, but a beauty like yours needs no help from me.~
@44605 = ~I didn't mean to intrude. I heard there was a woman of surpassing beauty in this room. The stories did not do you justice.~
@44606 = ~I demand you leave at ONCE! ~
@44607 = ~I didn't mean to offend you. I'll leave immediately.~
@44608 = ~I'm going, I'm going.~

@44617 = ~I can cast spells to reduce the signs of aging. I see you have little need of such things, except for... well, perhaps...~
@44618 = ~I misspoke. I have to be going.~
@44619 = ~Perhaps what? What is it? ~
@44620 = ~You have a few very fine lines... laugh-lines, I call them, around the corners of your eyes. I can get rid of them for a price.~
@44621 = ~How much would such a service cost? I've laughed a lot in my life.~
@44622 = ~That necklace around your throat would be sufficient payment. ~
@44623 = ~Wait. You're trying to trick me, I can tell!~
@44624 = ~My necklace? Well... I suppose it's worth it. Here you are.~
@44625 = ~Here is the spell I promised, madam. When next you awake, your laugh-lines will be gone.~
@44626 = ~Oh, thank you!~
@44627 = ~Don't think you can charm me. I've dealt with your type before.~
@44628 = ~Charm you, my lady? I wanted only to look upon your exquisite face. You've made me very happy.~
@44629 = ~Very well, I'll be going.~
@44630 = ~It's a blessing and a curse, this beauty of mine. You may stay a moment if you like.~
@44631 = ~I wish I could stay forever and gaze into your eyes. My heart aches at the thought of leaving you. ~
@44632 = ~I haven't heard such lovely words in a long time. Would that you could stay forever...~
@44633 = ~Perhaps I could leave my words behind. That necklace you're wearing—may I borrow it? I'll inscribe a love poem on it for you. ~
@44634 = ~Take it, dear one. Bring it back with words of love upon it. ~
@44635 = ~You again? You are both ignorant and oafish. Leave my room immediately!~
@44636 = ~I'm sorry, it was an accident.~
@44637 = ~And you still haven't learned how to post a guard. I'd look into that if I were you.~
@44638 = ~Words alone won't keep me from going where I will.~
@44639 = ~My deepest apologies. I heard there was a noblewoman here who might be interested in my anti-aging magic, but a beauty like yours needs no help from me.~
@44640 = ~I didn't mean to intrude, but I heard there was a woman of surpassing beauty in this room. The stories did not do you justice.~
@44641 = ~I can and I will. Now leave. ~
@44642 = ~I didn't mean to offend you. I'm leaving.~
@44643 = ~I'm going, I'm going.~

@44649 = ~Calm down. Have a glass of wine, maybe.~
@44650 = ~I'd think again before threatening me.~
@44651 = ~Yes, yes, Delenda. I heard you—the entire inn heard you. What is it?~
@44652 = ~A misunderstanding, nothing more.~
@44653 = ~I was having a look around the inn, nothing more. No need to wake the place up.~
@44654 = ~This doesn't concern you.~
@44655 = ~You're supposed to be my bodyguard, Bartleby. Do your job! This RUFFIAN refuses to leave.~
@44656 = ~I'm truly sorry for upsetting you. I'll leave.~
@44657 = ~I go where I please. Interfere with me at your own peril.~
@44658 = ~I'm done here anyway.~
@44659 = ~A bit late for that. What do you mean, upsettin' a lady like this? I've half a mind to cut you in twain.~
@44660 = ~There's no need for violence. I'm going.~
@44661 = ~Half a mind is about all you've got, from the sounds of it. I'm leaving, all right?~
@44662 = ~I've dealt with worse than you. Raise your hand to me and you'll be one on the floor.~
@44663 = ~When the haze of battle consumes me, I destroy all who stand before me. Would you join the fallen?~
@44664 = ~Attack me at your peril. My years of training make me a warrior without equal.~
@44665 = ~I have gazed into oblivion and taken strength from it. Stand aside or face the darkness I have mastered.~
@44666 = ~Go quick, then, before I change my mind about teaching you some manners.~
@44667 = ~Look, the lady hired me for a bodyguard, right? An' that's what I'm doing—tryin' to, anyway. You're better at this than me I can tell.~
@44668 = ~What are you waiting for, Bartleby? Attack <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@44669 = ~My life's worth more than what you pay, ma'am. YOU fight <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@44670 = ~Coward! Wait for me!~
@44671 = ~Hee hee, this'll be fun. I ain't whupped anyone in a while!~
@44672 = ~My love, it is torture to see your face and know we cannot be together.~
@44673 = ~I can feel the magic working!~
@44674 = ~What's going on up here? What's all that noise?~
@44675 = ~A misunderstanding. It's over now.~
@44676 = ~Nothing you have to worry about. ~
@44677 = ~I don't answer to you.~
@44678 = ~Is that man DEAD? Did you kill someone?~
@44679 = ~It was an accident, but I take responsibility.~

@44681 = ~Think twice before taking that tone with me.~
@44682 = ~You're lucky you're the hero of Baldur's Gate and have the Flaming Fist at your back. Ordinarily, we never tolerate violence here.~

@44887 = ~"Man" doesn't mean, like, MAN, man. It means, like... dude.~ [BD44887]
@44888 = ~Well, that clears that up. ~
@44889 = ~Hehehe, you're all right, man. What can I do for you?~ [BD44889]

@44891 = ~You said I could pull creatures into the Prime Material Plane? Is that, like, true?~
@44892 = ~Nothing right now.~
@44893 = ~All right, so like, our plane overlaps with all these other planes, right? Overlaps isn't really the right word; it's more like... circles. In other circles. It's complicated. Anyway, the other planes have creatures on them overlapping US. That's what you see.~ [BD44893]
@44894 = ~And you said I could pull creatures into this plane?~
@44895 = ~Thanks, Zaviak.~
@44896 = ~Yeah, like our reality is called the Prime Material Plane, and the other planes have other names. You can pull a creature from its plane to ours, but they might not like it, man. Think about it, you know, fish out of water, you know? Only maybe less with the fish dying and more them, like, killing you. Or not.~ [BD44896]

@44985 = ~I only know one poem... well it's more of a limerick, actually.~
@44986 = ~Recite it! ~
@44987 = ~Let's see, how did it go? There once was a powerful djinni... ~
@44988 = ~Yes? ~
@44989 = ~Whose scent was remarkably keen... ~
@44990 = ~Go on! ~
@44991 = ~When he wrinkled his nose and he smelled his own toes, then he turned from bright blue to lime-green. ~
@44992 = ~A terrible poem! I've never been so insulted in my life! That's not even how you pronounce "djinni"! ~
@44993 = ~My apologies, it was the only one I knew.~
@44994 = ~What's the matter, can't you take a joke?~
@44995 = ~You got what you asked for.~
@44996 = ~Here, take these bracers as payment for your song. They're suitable for a joker such as yourself!~

@45007 = ~Yes, I am the one responsible.~
@45008 = ~Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.~
@45009 = ~ 'Twas my power that drew you here, monster.~

@45011 = ~There's no need for violence. I didn't mean to upset you.~
@45012 = ~Obviously, I wouldn't summon a creature so powerful as you without SOME way to protect myself.~

@45016 = ~I'm on a vision quest. A crazy man gave me these glasses that draw spirits to me. It's not working out at the moment.~
@45017 = ~I wanted to see what I could release with the power of these spectacles.~
@45018 = ~Mmmm, I don't think you can hurt me. And I'm certain I don't like being dragged from my home. What inspired you to such foolishness?~

@45025 = ~It's a riddle, isn't it? I know it. It's a riddle.~
@45026 = ~I need no favors from you, fiend. I'll destroy you now and end this.~

@45028 = ~Enough! This game no longer entertains. I shall go and seek another, one with less... tenacious... competition. Fare thee well, mortal.~

The time has come to take action. Araya agrees with me that we can't risk openly challenging the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate. They wield too much influence, and their motives cannot be trusted. I've heard disturbing whispers regarding the killer of Sarevok, whom the dukes are now in league with. How can we trust them to lead our city and reap the profits thereof? Meet us at the Three Old Kegs on the morrow and we'll decide on a plan of action. Eldric should also be joining us. Burn this letter.

Olen Argent's quest to hunt down a cult of Malar led him to the Misty Forest, where he encountered a group of elves living in the woods. At first, the elves were suspicious of Olen and tried to drive him out of the forest, but he spoke so eloquently of his quest that they agreed to help him. The elves tracked the cult to their hiding place within the forest, where Olen eradicated the cultists for their murderous deeds. Thankful to have the evil presence out of their homeland, the elves crafted a fine suit of mail for the paladin.

One of the mermaids swam up to the ship and handed the bard a glittering shed mermaid tail, telling him that any item fashioned from the scales would gain a valuable enchantment.

Finally, one night Tinny stabbed his mark in a mugging gone wrong and was shocked to see a gem fall out of the victim's wound. Tinny eagerly grabbed the gem, rejoicing in his newfound wealth.

"My triumph is at hand. Daeros Dragonspear lies dead. Halatathlaer fell to the might of my one-time draconic allies, who cannot have been pleased to learn that I snatched Halatathlaer's treasures out from under them. Her gold, gems, and items of all sorts are mine now, but more than that, I found her clutch. The eggs are now concealed in caverns far beneath the Castle. Halatathlaer's wyrmling offspring will make perfect subjects for my necromantic experiments. I will continue to add to the series of spells that will sustain them on minimal food and water while they are prepared for their final fate. Wards throughout the cavern will prevent their escape until I return to complete the rites that will transform them into my undead servitors. If I am successful in this working, the dragons will be more than able to protect me from those who hunt me now. And should I fail—considering the intricacy of the magic involved, it is a possibility—the results will still be worthy of study."~

The rampant brigandry in the area means a great many stolen goods are funneled through Soubar's back rooms and inns. One of the town's residents, the halfling Gentrus, crafted this mirror to help him divine the true nature of items he wished to buy. After a close call with a wererat, Gentrus decided to leave Soubar for the safety of Baldur's Gate, joining a caravan traveling north. The halfling died on the road during a bandit attack, but the caravan's survivors drove off the bandits. They ensured Gentrus's body and possessions made it to his relatives.

While some halflings serve only a few years before moving on to other jobs or out of the city, many become lifelong members of the watch.

Barnassus tracked the medusa to her lair and realized, almost too late, that what he faced was no ordinary medusa but one that had also succumbed to the curse of vampirism.

Barnassus closed his eyes and charged forward, ready to take down his enemy or die trying. Lathander rewarded Barnassus's bravery by filling the room with sunlight while the priest slew the medusa.

@46389 = ~One.~
@46390 = ~Two.~
@46391 = ~Well, keep looking! The rest must be out there!~
@46392 = ~Here, take this shield. It's the one you were asking about, the one belonging to the halfling. Return it to him with my apologies.~
@46393 = ~What can I get for you?~
@46394 = ~Let's see what you have.~
@46395 = ~Nothing right now.~

@46400 = ~Some nobles rented out a room upstairs for the night. One room for three people. Makes you wonder, eh?~
@46401 = ~They say there's a secret door in the Flaming Fist headquarters. Leads into the sewers, apparently.~
@46402 = ~Duke Entar's daughter is growing up to be quite a handful, I hear.~
@46403 = ~A very good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you. Can I get you something from the bar?~
@46404 = ~Sure, what do you have?~
@46405 = ~Not right now, thanks.~
@46406 = ~Nothing to drink right now. Tell me, do you ever have trouble with the patrons here? ~
@46407 = ~What's the story with Sallo?~
@46408 = ~Mostly wine, but we also have a few casks of mead.~
@46409 = ~Let me know if you need anything.~
@46410 = ~Not usually. Bellowglyn runs the inn well. Our patrons know better than to drink too much or start a fight.~
@46411 = ~You're a beautiful woman, though. You must get a lot of attention.~
@46412 = ~Now and then you must get some troublemakers, though.~
@46413 = ~Good to know. What do you serve here?~
@46414 = ~Well, aren't you a charmer? The other servers here and I are all experienced hunters. We can take care of ourselves.~

@46427 = ~Not right now, thanks.~
@46428 = ~Oh, <PRO_HESHE>'s a regular. Drinks too much but never fights or gets out of control. Just sleeps it off behind the bar.~

@46453 = ~You leave the wine where it is.~
@46454 = ~Yes, I have it here.~
@46455 = ~What the... this isn't ruby wine! This is boring old regular wine! I told you, ruby wine has a sharp, spicy scent. Now go back and get the right stuff!~
@46456 = ~I told you, ruby wine has a really sharp, spicy smell. Now go back and get the right stuff!~

@46474 = ~I've got 150 gold pieces. Get me out of here and they're yours.~
@46475 = ~Done. Stand back, I'll see what I can do about the door.~
@46476 = ~Wait a moment. I'll see if I can find a key.~
@46477 = ~Not enough.~
@46478 = ~300 gold! I'll have to go to the Fist headquarters to fetch it, but I can give you 300 gold.~

@46481 = ~You're with the Flaming Fist? Why didn't you say so? Bide a moment, I'll see if I can find a key for the door.~
@46482 = ~Not nearly enough. Enjoy your incarceration.~
@46483 = ~Do it quickly. I may be safer in here than you are out there.~
@46484 = ~I'm an officer of the Flaming Fist. You've got to get me out of here!~
@46485 = ~How did you get in there?~
@46486 = ~You're a member of the Fist? Why didn't you say so? Let me see what I can do about this door.~

@46494 = ~I do.~
@46495 = ~Here it is. You know how to use it? Because I don't.~

@46503 = ~~
@46504 = ~Do it, then. We've suffered enough.~
@46505 = ~I have some knowledge in this arena. I should be able to close the spell, if not reverse its effects.~
@46506 = ~It is done.~
@46507 = ~Thank you.~
@46508 = ~Will you truly see us die for no good reason?~
@46509 = ~No, of course not. Here, take it.~
@46510 = ~No, but I absolutely will watch you die unless I receive 500 gold reasons. Good value all around, I'd say.~
@46511 = ~I would sacrifice anyone's life if it were to my benefit.~
@46512 = ~It would be my mildly put-upon pleasure.~

@46515 = ~Damn it! You drove us to this, <CHARNAME>! Get <PRO_HIMHER>! Get the scroll, whatever the cost!~
@46516 = ~I'd like to speak with you on the matter of a stolen ham. ~
@46517 = ~You want to know about Mattroun, then. ~
@46518 = ~You believe he committed the theft.~
@46519 = ~You saw him take the ham?~
@46520 = ~He insists he's innocent. You saw him take the ham?~
@46521 = ~I know quite enough of him.~
@46522 = ~Don't see how anyone else could've. ~
@46523 = ~Tell me what happened.~
@46524 = ~Nobody could have snuck past you? You're absolutely certain of this?~
@46525 = ~You display a woeful lack of imagination, then.~
@46526 = ~Didn't see him take it, but I would've seen if anyone else had. I was here working the forge the whole time, he was right round the corner. I heard him snoring for a while, but I figure he needs the sleep, and if anyone comes 'round, I'm here, right?~
@46527 = ~Didn't see him take it, but I would've seen if anyone else had.~
@46528 = ~No one else came around. But the grain bags were torn open and the ham was gone. If Mattroun didn't do it, whoever did would have to be invisible or shorter than I am to sneak past me while I was at the forge.~
@46529 = ~Now if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do.~
@46530 = ~I come with a warning, smith. The crusade has targeted you for death.~
@46531 = ~What arms and armor do you have available?~
@46532 = ~I believe we're done.~
@46533 = ~Well... You never say never, right? But whoever did it would've had to've been invisible, or shorter than I am to sneak past me while I was at the forge.~
@46534 = ~I do, do I? Well, that may be so, but I know what I see and I know what I didn't see.~
@46535 = ~I'd like to speak with you about some stolen food.~
@46536 = ~Jegg? Are you here? I've a sword that needs repair! Jegg?~
@46537 = ~Is this him? Is this the assassin?~
@46538 = ~Please, keep your voice down. The spy will be revealed, but we must give them a chance...~
@46539 = ~For the love of the gods, be quiet!~
@46540 = ~Be silent, you idiot woman!~
@46541 = ~Ho! You've a smart tongue! It's the smartest thing about you!~
@46542 = ~Is anyone here?~
@46543 = ~I'm here, and I need silence! Take your shouting elsewhere, you useless nit!~
@46544 = ~There's no one here.~
@46545 = ~Jegg? Is that you?~
@46546 = ~Aye, it's me.~
@46547 = ~What are you doing?~
@46548 = ~Whatever she was doing, it's over now.~
@46549 = ~Wasting a potion of invisibility, that's what she was doing.~
@46550 = ~Nothing. She's doing nothing.~
@46551 = ~Is everything all right?~
@46552 = ~It's fine, Roark. <CHARNAME> here got it in <PRO_HISHER> head I was in some sort of danger. Stuff and nonsense.~
@46553 = ~Danger? Are you sure everything's all right?~
@46554 = ~Don't fuss over me, man! Get back on the walls and keep the bloody crusade out!~
@46555 = ~Hillcarver! You here?~
@46556 = ~Aye, I'm here all right. Make your move, assassin.~
@46557 = ~Please, Mistress Hillcarver—you're going to give the game away.~
@46558 = ~Will you please shut the hells up?!~
@46559 = ~Still your fool tongue or I swear I'll cut it from your skulll!~
@46560 = ~Ho, you give me lip? Who needs you?~
@46561 = ~Jegg Hillcarver, smithy of Bridgefort! Are you here?~
@46562 = ~I'm trying to concentrate, you idiot! Do you want to die at the hands of the crusade's magicians? No? Then shut the hells up and let me work in peace!~
@46563 = ~Bloody dwarves. Act like they live to work and never around when you need 'em...~
@46564 = ~Hillcarver? I hear your voice, but I can't see you...~
@46565 = ~I'm over here. And I'm done with this bloody nonsense.~
@46566 = ~What are you doing?~
@46567 = ~Whatever she was doing, it's over now.~
@46568 = ~Wasting a potion of invisibility, that's what she was doing.~
@46569 = ~Nothing. She's doing nothing.~
@46570 = ~No, no, no, no. You don't put a stone of elnath in a potion of invisibility. It just isn't done.~
@46571 = ~But why isn't it done?~
@46572 = ~Because invisible explosions are the worst kind.~
@46573 = ~There's no proof that's what would happen.~
@46574 = ~That's because the evidence was incinerated by the explosion!~
@46575 = ~Forgive us if we are disturbing you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. My young colleague and I sometimes let our passion get the better of us.~
@46576 = ~Greetings. I am Elandro. This is Thirrim. We were just discussing—it matters not. A trivial matter to anyone without a special interest in the arcane arts.~
@46577 = ~There is no crime in being passionate about one's craft. My name is <CHARNAME>.~
@46578 = ~A pleasure to meet you. Is there anything I can do for you?~
@46579 = ~If you say so. For what it's worth, I think you're right—dousing a stone of elnath in invisibility potion is a bad idea. An explosively bad idea.~
@46580 = ~No, please continue. It was fascinating. I am <CHARNAME>, by the way.~
@46581 = ~I don't have time for this. In the future, stay out of my way.~
@46582 = ~If every mage felt as you two do, we'd never have discovered the Weave at all.~
@46583 = ~Feel free to test your theory, but please, do us the courtesy of waiting until there are no others of worth nearby.~ [BD46583]
@46584 = ~I have neither a potion of invisibility nor a stone of elnath, so it's all academic anyway. But never mind that.~
@46585 = ~I don't recognize you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Are you new to this place?~
@46586 = ~I've only just arrived.~
@46587 = ~I've not been here long, no.~
@46588 = ~New enough.~
@46589 = ~Can you tell us anything about what transpires beyond these walls? ~
@46590 = ~Caelar's crusade wreaks havoc across the Sword Coast. Coast Way Crossing is destroyed. Some fear she will do the same to Boareskyr Bridge.~
@46591 = ~Only that you're better off within them than without, unless you want to swear fealty to the Shining Lady.~
@46592 = ~Precious little.~
@46593 = ~I care little for politics.~
@46594 = ~We shall endeavor to do so.~
@46595 = ~We can do that? Why am I only just learning of this?~ [BD46595]
@46596 = ~You do not want to do that, my lady. Caelar's crusade is folly. She leads her followers to their doom. It is only a question of how many others they take with them.~ [BD46596]
@46597 = ~I'm with you, friend. I am more concerned about what awaits us should the crusade penetrate our defenses.~
@46598 = ~Wynan Hess is a good man. He'll keep the worst of it out.~
@46599 = ~Wynan Hess?~
@46600 = ~I hope you're right.~
@46601 = ~Would that he had. Do you not feel a subtle decline, both in health and morale? The crusade has landed a spellstone in the fort. A negative energy field is slowly killing all around us.~
@46602 = ~Now that you mention it, I have. I thought it simply a matter of fatigue. ~
@46603 = ~Far from it. The crusade has landed a spellstone in the fort. It emits a negative energy field that is slowly killing all around it.~
@46604 = ~Would that it were. I am doing all that I can to resolve the matter.~
@46605 = ~Keep on thinking that. You'll sleep better.~
@46606 = ~Have a care, <CHARNAME>. Thou'rt frightening these men, to no good purpose.~ [BD46606]
@46607 = ~Fear's good. Makes you careful. Keeps you alive.~ [BD46607]
@46608 = ~Gods! We are doomed!~
@46609 = ~All mortals die one day, but I'm doing everything I can to ensure that for those who take refuge in Bridgefort, that day is a long time coming.~
@46610 = ~Take heart, friend. All mortals die, but I'm doing everything in my power to ensure that day will be a long time coming for all who take refuge in Bridgefort.~
@46611 = ~Yes. Well, *you're* doomed. I'm not so eager to declare defeat.~
@46612 = ~Oh, I bet the ladies can't get enough of you...~
@46613 = ~That is a distinct possibility.~
@46614 = ~The only defeat is surrender. To fight, win or lose, is a victory of a sort.~
@46615 = ~Fighting and losing may be victory of a sort, but all things considered, I believe I'd be happier with the sort of victory that involves me winning.~
@46616 = ~Then we are in your debt.~
@46617 = ~Or we would be, were you able to do anything about the negative energy field. Canceling a spellstone's enchantment is all but impossible without the original scroll that powered it. In the best of all worlds, it would still be beyond anyone's reach in the crusade camp. I said we were doomed, and I've heard nothing to make me rethink that judgment.~
@46618 = ~Tell your simpering monkey to calm himself. The spellstone will be dealt with, as will the one who made it. He will be dealt with harshly indeed.~
@46619 = ~Please try not to agitate Elandro. Strong emotions can sometimes draw in evil creatures, and we don't need any more threats at the moment. ~
@46620 = ~Bridgefort's most powerful magician, gods help us. He maintains the wards that keep the crusade from wiping us off the map, but he is an old man. He'll not be able to maintain the shields much longer, I fear. Should his concentration lapse even for a moment, we are all of us doomed.~
@46621 = ~Then we are in your debt.~
@46622 = ~You are alchemists, ja? Voghiln has an idea how you might repay that debt. Have you heard of a brew called Luskan's Bane?~
@46623 = ~Can you think of nothing but your next drink?~
@46624 = ~Not nothing. But not much, either. Perhaps the ebon-skinned beauty would like to give me something else to consider for a time?~
@46625 = ~I'll give you a dagger in your back, you blubber-covered wael. Consider that. ~
@46626 = ~In <PRO_HISHER> debt? But <PRO_HESHE> hasn't done anything, at least nothing that I can see. Gods, the walls, I can feel them closing in around me. This is no fortress; it is a tomb!~
@46627 = ~All our lives in that doddering fool's withered claws... We're doomed. That's it. What in the hells are we going to do now? What will we do?~
@46628 = ~I've not slept a wink in five nights. The crusade will take us and kill us, or worse. We are doomed. Doomed!~
@46629 = ~Our fates are sealed.~
@46630 = ~Please, Elandro, don't start with this again. Think about potions of invisibility and volatile alchemical reactions. Too much fear and despair can summon unwanted creatures, especially at night.~
@46631 = ~What's the point, Thirrim? What is the point? I'm at my wit's end. I can't stand any more. I've not slept a wink in five nights. The crusade will take us and kill us, or worse. We are doomed. Doomed!~
@46632 = ~Ah, well. One has to ask...~
@46633 = ~Ah, yes. What can I do for you? ~
@46634 = ~Tell me a tale. How did you come to be here?~
@46635 = ~I overheard you discussing alchemy earlier, did I not? Do you have any potions for sale?~
@46636 = ~Let me see what potions you have.~
@46637 = ~I am worried about your friend.~
@46638 = ~You can do nothing for me, for now at least. If that changes, you will know it soon enough.~
@46639 = ~If we let commerce be impeded, the crusade has already won.~
@46640 = ~Of course, of course. Take a look; see what you like.~
@46641 = ~Who, Elandro? I know the man, but calling him a friend is pushing it. He's highly strung and reckless—a terrible combination in anyone dealing with magical energy.~
@46642 = ~He's on edge, and I fear he'll go over it. Can you do anything to calm him down? I fear what he may do, to himself or others.~
@46643 = ~You think he might be dangerous?~
@46644 = ~Does he pose a threat to security? Would we be safer if he were eliminated?~
@46645 = ~Just say the word...~
@46646 = ~Have you met many wizards that aren't?~
@46647 = ~I've tried to convince him to relax and get some sleep, but he is steadfast in his refusal. I'm concerned his amplified fears might attract unwanted attention. Could you talk to him tonight? In the dark his fears may manifest. If they do not, at least we'll know we're safe.~
@46648 = ~Fair enough. I'll just return to my work, then. Good fortune to you.~
@46649 = ~Unstable people frequently are.~
@46650 = ~Stability? Highly overrated, in my experience.~
@46651 = ~Then your experience is limited. Count yourself lucky for it.~
@46652 = ~I wouldn't go so far as to call him a threat. He just needs to relax.~
@46653 = ~If there's nothing else, I really should return to my work. Farewell.~
@46654 = ~I'll tell it if you wish, but it's not much of a story and I'm no bard.~
@46655 = ~Please, I'd like to know.~
@46656 = ~Never mind, then. You have wares to sell?~
@46657 = ~Let's leave it till another time, then. Farewell.~
@46658 = ~Someone wake me when this is over.~ [BD46658]
@46659 = ~And to you.~
@46660 = ~I am an alchemist by trade—well, one of my trades. I am a merchant also, of the potions I make and those of others. Though I fear I make a far better alchemist than I do a merchant.~
@46661 = ~I understand. Please, continue.~
@46662 = ~Good that you see it. Recognizing one's limitations is apparently a skill few possess these days.~
@46663 = ~I am bored already. Don't bother finishing your tale.~
@46664 = ~You can't say I didn't warn you. Well, I'd best get back to my work. Fortune be yours.~
@46665 = ~Really? Gods help me...~ [BD46665]
@46666 = ~Absolutely, though acknowledging one's individual abilities is also an admirable attribute.~ [BD46666]

@46670 = ~Before I arrived here, I was in the village of Soubar, acquiring a collection of useful and highly valuable potions—most were wasted on the crusade, more's the pity. I met Elandro on the road. We traveled together awhile, I intending to eventually go north to Waterdeep, he south to Daggerford.~
@46671 = ~I've been to Daggerford. It was... unpleasant.~
@46672 = ~We were nearly across Boareskyr when the crusade intercepted us, demanding all our possessions. Elandro lost most of his wares; through good fortune and foresight, I held on to most of mine.~
@46673 = ~I imagine the rest is obvious enough. We took refuge here, where we await the resolution of the siege.~
@46674 = ~Thank you for whiling away a few minutes. I appreciate it.~
@46675 = ~You were right—you're no bard.~
@46676 = ~You won't have to wait long now that I'm here.~

@46679 = ~Eh, what? Oh. Forgive me. I'm just—~

@46681 = ~There's some who'd covet your place behind these walls. Better that than face the crusade, no?~
@46682 = ~I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do!~
@46683 = ~Do not punish yourself for your fear. Acknowledge it, accept it, learn to live with it. This won't destroy you. It's making you stronger.~

@46685 = ~There's nothing you can do but keep your head down, help those you can, and wait to see how this all plays out.~
@46686 = ~Your forlorn whimpers help nothing. Learn to live with your doubts, or if you can't, at least keep them to yourself.~
@46687 = ~This is worthy advice, applicable in nearly all circumstances.~ [BD46687]

@46717 = ~A fear? What in the Pit is that?~
@46718 = ~A feyr is the inevitable consequence of a surfeit of magical energy combined with the unchecked fear of, say, a fort full of monkeys hiding in their own filth, trying to avoid an overwhelming force that seeks to destroy them. This is only the first. If circumstances don't change, there will be others.~ [BD46718]
@46719 = ~Is there nothing we can do?~

@46759 = ~I'm always happy to see a friendly face, no matter how bad the breath coming out of it.~
@46760 = ~Let me guess—you're the cleric, Tajik, right? I'd heard you were most attached to your dog. I'd like to talk with you about a half-elf named Senderin and her son, if I may.~

@46765 = ~Perhaps a donation would change your mind? Say, 50 gold?~

@46767 = ~I don't suppose 200 gold pieces would change your mind?~
@46768 = ~Heal the damned horses or Caelar and her flock will be the least of your worries. Am I making myself understood, here?~
@46769 = ~Sensible. I'll leave you to your business, then.~
@46770 = ~Ah, yes. Yes, you are... quite clear. I'll attend to the matter immediately. Excuse me. Come, Dare! Come on, boy!~
@46771 = ~I've spent weeks fighting the crusade from within this crumbling pile of rocks. Do you really think I fear you? Good day to you. Come, Dare!~

@46773 = ~Here you go. ~
@46774 = ~In better times, it might, but if these were better times, I could just heal the horses. I have a duty to preserve sentient life wherever I can—animals come a distant second, Dare excepted, of course. Now if you'll excuse me—come, Dare!~

@46779 = ~Is that a problem?~
@46780 = ~You'll be apologizing to me AND the goblin in a minute with that attitude.~
@46781 = ~Are you not sorry? I could make you sorry, if that would help.~
@46782 = ~P-please, Frair. I'd ap-appreciate it.~
@46783 = ~Please forgive the dog, miss—missus? Mister? Miss. Dare wouldn't hurt anyone, not even a gob—ah, I mean, not anyone. Sorry for any trouble he gave you.~
@46784 = ~Come on, Dare. Let's stop bothering the nice <PRO_MANWOMAN> now.~
@46785 = ~Begone, you wretched beast! Go, or I swear I'll turn you into a pair of boots!~ [BD46785]
@46786 = ~Just admit it, you traitorous pig!~

@46788 = ~I didn't eat any of the food! I didn't, I swear it!~
@46789 = ~Well, someone took that ham. I didn't do it, and Taryl didn't do it. You say you didn't take it? Then who did, eh? Tell me that!~
@46790 = ~What's going on here?~
@46791 = ~You say this man stole your ham? ~
@46792 = ~Believe what you like, do to your friend what you like, I care not—but do it quietly, or by the gods I'll make you wish you had.~
@46793 = ~What's going on here is no concern of yours.~
@46794 = ~They say I took a ham from the storeroom, but I didn't do it!~
@46795 = ~I've got five knuckles that say you did. You calling my fist a liar?~
@46796 = ~Easy, there. What was stolen? Just a ham?~
@46797 = ~I'll call it broken if you don't step back, take a deep breath, and calm down. Now, you say he stole a ham?~
@46798 = ~Explain this nonsense. Quickly. I've little patience for others' idiocy.~
@46799 = ~This flickspittle's been stealing from the fort's supplies. Just little things at first—bags of grain, mostly. But this is too much. He stole a ham! An entire ham! You're a thief, Mattroun! Admit it!~
@46800 = ~There is no "just" a ham when you're stuck in a place that's under siege!~
@46801 = ~He took more than the ham anyway. There's bags of grain gone missing too. He's working for the crusade!~
@46802 = ~He took more than that. There's bags of grain gone missing too. He's working for the crusade!~
@46803 = ~Forgive us, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. We've been stuck inside these crumbling walls for weeks—tension's running high. We'll try to keep it down.~
@46804 = ~I'm not, I swear! I don't know what's going on.~
@46805 = ~Nor do I, but I promise you I will find out. Until then, you two leave this man in peace, am I understood?~
@46806 = ~Seems a simple enough matter to resolve. I'll look into it and see what's really going on here. Until then, try to behave yourselves. Got it?~
@46807 = ~What's going on is you're about to receive a vicious beating from your fellows. Try to cover your head.~
@46808 = ~We'll do as you say. But when you discover this piece of excrement did as we say, we're taking that ham out of your hide, Mattroun!~
@46809 = ~All right, Mattroun! Time to face the music.~
@46810 = ~And my fists! And probably my boots, but first, fists!~
@46811 = ~A poor performance, that. Bridgefort needs all the defenders it can get, yet you leave a man to be beaten, possibly to death, for no good reason.~
@46812 = ~They had a reason, and a good one. He stole from them. It is fitting he be punished for it.~ [BD46812]
@46813 = ~We don't know what he did. We could have at least looked into the matter.~
@46814 = ~We waste enough time on baboons as it is. Let them sort it out amongst themselves, I say.~
@46815 = ~Hm? Oh, it's you. So, you figure out who's been stealing supplies yet?~
@46816 = ~Alas, no. But I continue to look into the matter.~
@46817 = ~Working on it. ~
@46818 = ~Not yet. Tell me why you believe your friend took the food.~
@46819 = ~I wanted to talk to you about that, actually. When did the food start going missing?~
@46820 = ~I know who's doing it. You are.~
@46821 = ~Mattroun? That swine's no friend of mine.~
@46822 = ~What?~
@46823 = ~A joke. Unless you did steal the food. Did you?~
@46824 = ~Did I say you did it? Forgive me. The stress of being in this godsforsaken place must be getting to me. Why do you believe Mattroun is the thief?~
@46825 = ~You stole the ham and the grain. At least, that's what I'll tell your friend if you don't give me 200 gold pieces to prove your innocence.~
@46826 = ~200 gold—? I don't have that much! I've got... here, I have 35 gold and three potions. Will that be enough for you?~
@46827 = ~It will suffice. Hand them over.~
@46828 = ~Perhaps. Giving them to me won't hurt your case, at any rate.~
@46829 = ~Hope you choke on them, fiend. You're worse than Mattroun.~
@46830 = ~Well, let me know when you find out. I want to be there to pay the dog back.~
@46831 = ~Don't know. We didn't notice it till this morning. Then we did a count and realized we were shorter on grain that we ought to be. But it's the ham that really hurts. I'd kill for some ham right now...~
@46832 = ~If you want ham, you should slaughter a pig, not your fellow defender of the fort.~
@46833 = ~Yeah, I picked up on that. What makes you think Mattroun is the culprit?~
@46834 = ~I'm done with you.~
@46835 = ~We don't have a lot of people for security in the fort itself—even us who watch the storage room do our time on the walls, making sure the crusaders don't get in.~
@46836 = ~There're four—well, three, now—people who watch the store room. Me, Taryl, and that pig Mattroun. Kellard took an arrow yesterday, so we lost him.~
@46837 = ~I am sorry for your loss.~
@46838 = ~It happens.~
@46839 = ~I don't want to hear about who didn't take the food. I want to know who did.~
@46840 = ~Enough. I weary of this conversation.~
@46841 = ~We know the ham was taken while Mattroun was minding the store. He says he fell asleep and someone snuck by him. But Jegg Hillcarver's forge is right around the corner from there. She says nobody went in or out of the area while Mattroun was there.~
@46842 = ~Mattroun is a pig. And if it comes down to it, I'll roast and eat him like one. I'm THAT hungry.~
@46843 = ~Yeah. Me too. Anyway...~
@46844 = ~It shouldn't happen to a man like Kellard. But it's done, and there's naught to be done about it. As to Mattroun...~
@46845 = ~No! I didn't steal that ham, or the wheat, or any other gods damned thing in the storeroom. Listen...~
@46846 = ~Look, Mattroun took the ham, that's all there is to it. When you figure that out, you let me know. Until then, keep your distance.~
@46847 = ~Well met. And how are you finding our little fort?~
@46848 = ~It's in better shape than I'd have expected, given the crusade's actions.~
@46849 = ~Better than some. There's a half-elf named Senderin out back who's beside herself with worry over the state of her horses.~
@46850 = ~I've spent time in worse places. But not many.~
@46851 = ~Disappointing. It cannot withstand the crusade much longer.~
@46852 = ~Indefensible, in every sense of the word.~
@46853 = ~I fear you are right—but I hope you are wrong. If there is anything I can help you with, please let me know.~
@46854 = ~We have Khalid to thank for that. Without him, we would have fallen long ago. If there's anything I can help you with, please do let me know.~
@46855 = ~If there's anything I can help you with, please let me know.~
@46856 = ~These are hard times. We do the best we can, under the circumstances. Well, I'd best return to my duties. If there's anything I can help you with, please let me know.~
@46857 = ~That is unfortunate, but I told Senderin—and her son Merome, SEVERAL times—it would be irresponsible to expend resources healing horses while actual people are at risk.~
@46858 = ~I understand. Farewell, Frair Tajik.~
@46859 = ~Perhaps a donation to the church would change your mind? Say, 50 gold?~
@46860 = ~You're a man of faith, but even a man of faith must eat. What if I offered you 100 gold pieces to heal the horses?~
@46861 = ~I don't suppose 200 gold pieces would change your mind?~
@46862 = ~You can heal the damned horses or you can heal yourself, it's your choice to make. Am I making myself understood, here?~
@46863 = ~That makes sense, but it seems few in these parts value the sensible much. I'll leave you to your business, then.~
@46864 = ~So are we good to pound that barnacle on Bridgefort's arse Mattroun into a bloody pulp? ~
@46865 = ~I've yet to determine whether he stole the ham.~
@46866 = ~Not yet, no.~
@46867 = ~When we are, I'll let you know.~
@46868 = ~What makes you so certain Mattroun is the thief?~
@46869 = ~You're the one who'll be pulped if you don't give me what I want.~
@46870 = ~Good. You do that.~
@46871 = ~Why're you talking to me, then?~
@46872 = ~I would know why you believe him guilty of the crime.~
@46873 = ~I really don't know.~
@46874 = ~I am in need of gold. I thought you might give me some. 200 pieces, to be precise. In exchange, I'll not accuse you of stealing from the supply room.~
@46875 = ~Be on your way, then.~
@46876 = ~I believe it because he did it, that's why I believe it. Nobody else could've. Jegg would've seen them!~
@46877 = ~I'll have to speak to mistress Hillcarver about this.~
@46878 = ~Jegg?~
@46879 = ~I'll look into that.~
@46880 = ~Interesting. I'll leave you to your prayers now.~
@46881 = ~Our smith. She was at her forge the whole time, just a few feet from Mattroun. She saw him snoozing when he was supposed to be on watch.~
@46882 = ~You know what she didn't see? She didn't see anyone else go into the store room. But when Kellard took over, the ham was gone.~
@46883 = ~You make a compelling case against Mattroun. I'll consider the matter.~
@46884 = ~I'd like to speak to this Kellard.~
@46885 = ~Most helpful. I will leave you to your prayers now.~
@46886 = ~I hope you're a god, then—you're not likely to get a chance otherwise. A crusade arrow got him.~
@46887 = ~I'm sorry for your loss.~
@46888 = ~That's unfortunate.~
@46889 = ~I see. Very well. I'll leave you to your meditations.~
@46890 = ~You do that. She was at her forge the whole time, just a few feet from Mattroun. She heard saw him dozing when he was supposed to be standing guard.~
@46891 = ~Well, come get me when you are. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@46892 = ~It'll be a better one when Mattroun gets what's coming to him.~
@46893 = ~What are you on about now...?~
@46894 = ~Nothing of any great import. Tell me, why do you believe Mattroun stole the ham?~
@46895 = ~Give me 200 gold and I'll not accuse you of the theft.~
@46896 = ~So that's how you want to do this, eh? I can play that game. I was a woman of means when the 'fort was open. Here. That's not just for me, mind. I want that lousy filcher Mattroun on a meathook. Come let me know when I can put him down.~
@46897 = ~You threaten me? I'll hang you from a meathook, you rotten swindler! ~
@46898 = ~That's not just for me, mind you. I want that lousy filcher Mattroun on a meathook, you understand? Get out of here now. Come let me know when I can put him down.~
@46899 = ~Mattroun's going to be sorrier for his. Come and get me when I'm allowed to twist his fat, thieving fingers off.~
@46900 = ~More unfortunate for some than for others. Let me know when I'm allowed to kick Mattroun's teeth down his stinking throat. You'll find me either here or on the wall.~
@46901 = ~Ho there. You have my thanks for saving me from Taryl and Harth, for the moment, at least. My name is Mattroun.~
@46902 = ~Pleased to meet you, Mattroun. I am <CHARNAME>.~
@46903 = ~You're the one they think stole the ham, yes? My name is <CHARNAME>.~
@46904 = ~I could save you from them for longer, if you gave me, say, 200 gold pieces...~
@46905 = ~Oh, I know who you are. Bridgefort's a small place. Word travels fast. Faster than the truth. Taryl and Harth have half my friends believing I stole from them. ~
@46906 = ~If it be not true, you can count on me to defend you.~
@46907 = ~Don't worry about Taryl and Harth. I'll take care of your accusers.~
@46908 = ~I can help you with that—for a price. Give me 200 gold and I'll lay the blame elsewhere.~
@46909 = ~It's NOT true, I swear it! I've risked my life to defend Bridgefort, I'd never do anything to harm a single one of these people. I was just...~
@46910 = ~What? I—I don't have that kind of money. I don't have any money!~
@46911 = ~Of all the luck... Well, I had to try. All right, tell me how you came to be accused in this matter.~
@46912 = ~Can you GET that kind of money?~
@46913 = ~That is unfortunate—for you. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@46914 = ~Then I guess we're done talking.~
@46915 = ~What? I—I don't have that kind of money. I don't have any money! Please, please, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, don't do this! They'll kill me! I didn't take anything.~
@46916 = ~Of all the luck... Well, I had to try. All right, tell me how you came to be accused in this matter.~
@46917 = ~All right, calm down. Tell me a tale. How did you come to find yourself in this unenviable position?~
@46918 = ~You should have. That way you'd have something with which to bargain. Farewell, Mattroun—as well as you can.~
@46919 = ~Have mercy on me, I beg you. I don't want to die. I don't want to die...~
@46920 = ~No. No! I'll not let you do this to me! On your guard, fiend!~
@46921 = ~Take care of them...? What do you mean to do? Harth and Taryl aren't evil—well, Harth isn't. I don't want them hurt, I just want them to, you know, not hurt me, either.~
@46922 = ~Though they accuse you of a grievous crime, you show them compassion. Alas, I doubt they'd do the same for you. Tell me then, do you know anyone else who might have done this deed?~
@46923 = ~Well, someone has to pay for the bloody crime, else everyone will think they can get away with robbing their fellows.~
@46924 = ~You would have me spare your accusers? Pathetic. I'm done with you.~
@46925 = ~I was so tired after my shift on the wall—so tired. I was to watch the supply room, and I did, for a time—but I couldn't keep my eyes open. I fell asleep. When I awoke, there was a trail of grain leading from the room. I checked, and a ham was missing.~
@46926 = ~Jegg Hillcarver, the little... blacksmith, was at her forge the whole time 'round the corner the whole time. She says I was the only one to go near the room the entire time, but I didn't do it, I swear, it wasn't me!~
@46927 = ~I see. Can you think of someone who might be wiling to rob the supply room?~
@46928 = ~I'm going to look into this for you. While I do, you'd do well to stay low. Don't draw attention to yourself, don't get anyone else angry at you.~
@46929 = ~Silence! You're pathetic, man! I should let you take the blame for the theft just to still those blubbering lips!~
@46930 = ~There's a man named Roark. I don't like the way he looks at us sometimes. But if he did do it, Jegg would surely have seen him pass. Though she's made me a suspect, I can't see her lying, for any reason.~
@46931 = ~We have a mystery then. One I shall endeavor to solve. Until then, keep to yourself and try and stay out of trouble.~
@46932 = ~I've seen this Roark. A crusade sling-wielder creased his skull. He lives, through blind luck or gods' grace, I know not which.~
@46933 = ~If I see this Roark, I'll talk to him. Until then, keep to yourself, you understand?~
@46934 = ~I see. Very well. I'll be about my business, then.~
@46935 = ~I'll do that. Thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@46936 = ~As I said, his face—his eyes—sometimes disturb me, but that is an unfounded prejudice. I am glad he survived.~
@46937 = ~I'm going to get to the bottom of this matter, Mattroun. Until I do, keep to yourself, eh? Try and stay out of trouble.~
@46938 = ~As he is, I'm sure. Look, I'm going to try and find out what's going on with the theft, but in the meantime, you need to be careful. Be quiet. Don't attract attention to yourself. Got it?~
@46939 = ~It might have served you better if he hadn't—you could have accused him of the crime and been done with it. I'll leave you to your business—for the moment.~
@46940 = ~Take care of yourself, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. There's crusaders about. ~
@46941 = ~Who're you? ~
@46942 = ~The name's <CHARNAME>. I am also called the champion of Baldur's Gate. I'm here to help.~
@46943 = ~I am called <CHARNAME>. And you are?~
@46944 = ~No one of consequence. Be seeing you.~
@46945 = ~Glad to hear it—we need all the help we can get. What can I do for you? ~
@46946 = ~Who are you?~
@46947 = ~I'm looking into the matter of some stolen food.~
@46948 = ~I would know your thoughts on the crimes Mattroun is accused of.~
@46949 = ~For now? Nothing.~
@46950 = ~The ham Mattroun stole? ~
@46951 = ~The ham Mattroun might have stolen.~
@46952 = ~You believe he did it, then?~
@46953 = ~Has any other food been stolen recently?~
@46954 = ~I can scarce believe it myself. But Jegg wouldn't lie and Mattroun didn't do himself any favors with his explanation. ~
@46955 = ~Tell me the story as it was told to you. I assume it was told to you, you didn't see it yourself?~
@46956 = ~What was his explanation?~
@46957 = ~I see. Thank you for the information. Farewell.~
@46958 = ~Terrible, is what it was. He says he fell asleep, which is easy enough to believe, I've nodded off once or twice myself. When he woke up, the feedbags were torn open and the ham was gone. Jegg was right over there the whole time, she didn't see anyone come by. He admits she would've seen anyone else, but insists he didn't do it. It's a, what's it called—? A quandary, that's what it is.~
@46959 = ~Luck to you.~
@46960 = ~I saw some of the spilled grain on the floor. When I heard about the ham, I could've wept. I don't know who did it, in truth, but they've much to answer for.~
@46961 = ~They will. I assure you. May I look around?~
@46962 = ~They will pay a high price indeed for the crimes they've committed.~
@46963 = ~We are of one mind on that. Farewell.~
@46964 = ~Of course. Just don't take anything, yeah? ~
@46965 = ~I'll leave the door open.~
@46966 = ~You can trust me.~
@46967 = ~With your eagle eye upon me? I wouldn't dare try.~
@46968 = ~I trusted Mattroun, and that didn't turn out so well. You need anything else, you let me know.~
@46969 = ~Not much choice there—it doesn't lock. Bridgefort wasn't made with thieves in mind, y'know? If there's anything you need, let me know.~
@46970 = ~Wessel. Pleased to make your acquaintance.~
@46971 = ~All right, all right. I had to say it. You don't need to lay it on THAT thick.~
@46972 = ~Not long, not long at all. Kellard—the man who had this shift 'fore me—he just died yesterday. Bloody crusade.~
@46973 = ~Anything I can do for you...?~
@46974 = ~That should do it. Thank you.~
@46975 = ~I'm looking into the matter of some stolen food.~
@46976 = ~I would know your thoughts on the crimes Mattroun is accused of.~
@46977 = ~For now? Nothing.~
@46978 = ~I don't know how you got here, but watch your back, all right? This is a dangerous place to be right now. Farewell. ~
@46979 = ~A dog did this. Foul beasts, all of 'em.~ [BD46979]
@46980 = ~We know who our thief is now, or at least who he isn't. It was a dog's teeth that picked this bone clean.~
@46981 = ~Boo says no man stole this bone. A hungry dog did this. Hungry before it got the ham. Afterward? Not so much.~ [BD46981]
@46982 = ~Ah! Get it away from me! Away!~ [BD46982]
@46983 = ~Dare! Leave her alone! Come here!~
@46984 = ~How goes the search for the thief? ~
@46985 = ~I believe I know who stole the ham.~
@46986 = ~You heard about that, did you?~
@46987 = ~It's nearing its end, thank the gods.~
@46988 = ~You'll find out shortly.~
@46989 = ~The fort's not so big. Word travels fast. ~
@46990 = ~I know who stole the ham.~
@46991 = ~Mattroun has found that out firsthand.~
@46992 = ~Then you'll hear of my results soon enough.~
@46993 = ~I see. What—what are you going to do? ~
@46994 = ~It's all right, Frair. I've a fondness for animals myself. I won't let anything happen to Dare.~
@46995 = ~That depends. Dare isn't the only animal suffering in Bridgefort. The half-elf Senderin's horses are near death. She and her son have lost much already, I'd hate for them to lose more. Wouldn't you?~
@46996 = ~A man's life hangs in the balance here. What would you have me do?~
@46997 = ~That depends on how much you're willing to pay for your friend's life.~
@46998 = ~Senderin and Merome do NOT see their horses as I do Dare. But I'll do anything to save my dog—anything. I'll go tend to the horses immediately.~
@46999 = ~Dare is like a child to me. I'll give you everything I have; please, don't turn him over to Taryl or the others—they'll rip him apart!~
@47000 = ~They'll do no such thing. The dog meant no harm, he simply did what came naturally. Get him on a leash, though—we don't want a repeat of this situation.~
@47001 = ~I understand. But the fort's defenders need provisions more than your dog does. You've compromised morale and taken food from your fellows' mouths.~
@47002 = ~And eat her, in all likelihood. All right. Give me all the gold you've got—everything of value—and I'll not reveal what I know.~
@47003 = ~You're a good <PRO_MANWOMAN>, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Thank you, thank you for sparing my little girl. ~
@47004 = ~There's been enough suffering in this place of late. I'll not add to yours.~
@47005 = ~A pleasure doing business with you.~
@47006 = ~Cease your gibbering. Your gold's all the thanks I need.~
@47007 = ~Bless you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. You've done a good and noble thing. Lathander will smile upon you, I'm sure of it. Thank you, bless you!~
@47008 = ~That is unfortunate.~
@47009 = ~You realize I can't let him continue to take the blame for the theft, don't you?~
@47010 = ~It could be very unfortunate. Taryl and Harth want to kill him. If I let them, I'll be complicit in murder. Would you truly let that happen?~
@47011 = ~It will be more unfortunate still for the true culprit.~
@47012 = ~Oh. Good... That's good...? ~
@47013 = ~You figure out who's been stealing supplies yet? ~
@47014 = ~I have. Bring Taryl and Mattroun in here and all will be revealed.~
@47015 = ~Alas, no. I continue to look into it.~
@47016 = ~Working on it. ~
@47017 = ~Not yet. Tell me why you believe Mattroun took the food.~
@47018 = ~Aye. I'll do that.~
@47019 = ~Taryl's dead.~
@47020 = ~I'm sorry to hear it. Well, it won't have the same drama, but fetch Mattroun and let's see this done.~
@47021 = ~Good riddance to bad rubbish. Get Mattroun then, and meet me over by the shrine.~
@47022 = ~Mattroun... isn't with us anymore. ~
@47023 = ~Did Taryl kill him?~
@47024 = ~Ah. Right. Well, get Taryl anyway and bring her to me near the entrance to the shrine.~
@47025 = ~They're dead. ~
@47026 = ~Both of them? That's... unfortunate.~
@47027 = ~Oh. Right. Never mind, then.~
@47028 = ~Then I've wasted time and effort on this fool's errand.~
@47029 = ~You know how he died. ~
@47030 = ~Ah. Yes. Very well. Get Taryl, then, and meet me by the shrine's entrance.~
@47031 = ~If you insist. Though Mattroun is dead, we should still see this to an end. Fetch Taryl. Bring her to me near the entrance to the shrine.~
@47032 = ~I don't know how he died. ~
@47033 = ~Ah. Yes. Very well. Get her, then, and meet me by the entry to the shrine.~
@47034 = ~If you insist. Though Mattroun is dead, we should still see this to an end. Fetch Taryl. Bring her to me near the shrine's entrance.~
@47035 = ~You've my thanks for the effort, but it was Taryl who really cared about this mess. Without her, there's not much reason to pursue the matter that I can see. Fare thee well.~
@47036 = ~Seems to me you did well enough out of this. They're dead and you line your pockets. I'm done with you. Fare thee well, "hero."~
@47037 = ~So are we good to pound a lousy no-good pilferer into a bloody pulp? ~
@47038 = ~Get Harth and Mattroun and meet me outside the shrine. All will be revealed.~
@47039 = ~I'll tell you after you've assembled the others in the hall outside. If worst comes to worst, I'd not see a shrine of Lathander desecrated by violence.~
@47040 = ~Not yet, no.~
@47041 = ~When we are, I'll let you know.~
@47042 = ~What makes you so certain Mattroun is the thief?~
@47043 = ~You'll be the one pulped if I don't get what I want.~
@47044 = ~Something's gonna be desecrated by violence, I can tell you that much.~
@47045 = ~Harth's dead. But I'll get that vile poltroon Mattroun for you, sure enough.~
@47046 = ~Was it Mattroun who did it? If it was, forget all this. He's dead.~
@47047 = ~Mattroun was the criminal, yes.~
@47048 = ~It wasn't Mattroun.~
@47049 = ~Don't waste your time. It's over. Mattroun is dead, so's Harth. A missing ham... doesn't seem so big a thing right now. Farewell.~
@47050 = ~As you wish.~
@47051 = ~Well, now you've got me interested. I'll fetch Harth.~
@47052 = ~I knew it! I BLOODY WELL KNEW IT! Bloody Mattroun. He's lucky he's dead, you know that? He's LUCKY.~
@47053 = ~How goes the investigation? ~
@47054 = ~I'm ready to expose the culprit. Gather the others and meet me inside the keep, outside the shrine.~
@47055 = ~Relax. I've got it all figured out. Get Harth and Taryl and meet me in the hall outside the shrine.~
@47056 = ~Nervous? I would be. Bring the others to the main hall.~
@47057 = ~If I must. Best to have this done quickly.~
@47058 = ~Do we really need to do this? Taryl's dead. Harth doesn't care that much without her egging him on.~
@47059 = ~Get him anyway. Best we clear your name.~
@47060 = ~You're right. Very well. We'll call this done, then.~
@47061 = ~I like the sound of that.~
@47062 = ~Harth's dead. I'll get Taryl, but you've gotta stay between us. She wanted to kill me before, who knows what sort of mood she's in now?~
@47063 = ~There's no one else to get. Harth and Taryl are dead.~
@47064 = ~I'm sorry to hear that.~
@47065 = ~This war. This damned, dirty war. How many more lives will it claim? HOW MANY?!~
@47066 = ~It happens.~
@47067 = ~I'd be sorrier if they hadn't been hells-bent on killing me for something I didn't do. Luck to you, <CHARNAME>.~
@47068 = ~I like the sound of that.~
@47069 = ~It wasn't a war that killed them. It was you.~
@47070 = ~Oh. Right. Well, good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you then.~
@47071 = ~I solved your problem. I think that merits a reward of some sort, don't you?~
@47072 = ~A better one than it could've been with Harth and especially Taryl alive. This wasn't how I wanted things to end, but you have my thanks. Farewell.~
@47073 = ~...Fine. Here's what I have. It's all I've got. You want to kill me for what I don't have, you go right ahead.~
@47074 = ~What's going on...?~
@47075 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate's gonna tell us who stole the ham. Then I'm gonna kick their thieving arse round the courtyard.~
@47076 = ~I tell you, I didn't steal the ham! I didn't steal ANY food!~
@47077 = ~We'll see about that.~
@47078 = ~What have you learned, <CHARNAME>?~
@47079 = ~Mattroun did it. He took the ham.~
@47080 = ~Enough to determine who your thief is.~
@47081 = ~The thief is dead. Let us leave it at that.~
@47082 = ~Forgive me, Frair. I have to tell them the truth.~
@47083 = ~It was Frair Tajik's dog that took the ham.~
@47084 = ~Nothing. I don't know who stole the ham. I wish I did, but I don't.~
@47085 = ~What? All that and this is what you give us? "Hero of Baldur's Gate," my pockmarked behind! Worthless, that's what you are. Worthless!~
@47086 = ~I'd hoped for better than this, <CHARNAME>. If Taryl kills me, it's on your head.~
@47087 = ~A weak effort, <CHARNAME>. I can't say I expected better at this point, but I had hoped for it. Farewell.~
@47088 = ~No, let's not do that! "Hero of Baldur's Gate," my pockmarked behind! Worthless, that's what you are. Worthless!~
@47089 = ~Well, at the least you saw my innocence. I thank you for that.~
@47090 = ~Let's hear the verdict, then.~
@47091 = ~The man who took the ham is dead. Let us leave it at that.~
@47092 = ~Forgive me, Frair. I have to tell them the truth.~
@47093 = ~It was Frair Tajik's dog that took the ham.~
@47094 = ~I wish I had one. The thief's identity remains a mystery.~
@47095 = ~I'm surprised you're so eager for my judgment, Mattroun—seeing as you stole the ham.~
@47096 = ~What? All that and this is what you give us? "Hero of Baldur's Gate," my pockmarked behind! Worthless, that's what you are. Worthless!~
@47097 = ~I'd hoped for better than this, <CHARNAME>. If Taryl kills me, it's on your head.~
@47098 = ~Liar! You dirty liar, I'll have your head!~
@47099 = ~I'll have yours first, you rank bastard!~
@47100 = ~Frair...? What's <PRO_HESHE> on about?~
@47101 = ~Don't do this, <CHARNAME>. I beg you, please...~
@47102 = ~The truth is... I found a rat hole behind the store room shelves, and in it, a hambone picked clean of meat.~
@47103 = ~Mattroun's crime is nothing more than falling asleep. As to who took the ham, well that was Frair's dog.~
@47104 = ~Er... The thief is dead. Let's just let sleeping dogs lie.~
@47105 = ~ 'Twas Frair's ragged hound that raided the larder.~
@47106 = ~Rats...? That makes a kind of sense.~
@47107 = ~Rats! Yes! That explains everything!~
@47108 = ~Huh. Guess I owe someone an apology.~
@47109 = ~I gratefully accept your apology.~
@47110 = ~I didn't say I was sorry, just that I owed you an apology. You didn't take the ham, but I still want to kill you. It'll pass. Just give me some time.~
@47111 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for your efforts, your service in resolving this. Everyone in Bridgefort is in your debt.~
@47112 = ~It was my sincere pleasure, Frair. I'm glad to have helped.~
@47113 = ~Big rats they were too. Huge buggers.~
@47114 = ~Some more than others. By the way, didn't I hear you say you were going to go heal a couple of horses?~
@47115 = ~Let us retire to the shrine to discuss how that debt might best be repaid.~
@47116 = ~Yes. They are.~
@47117 = ~Er, yes. Yes, you did. I'll be taking care of that shortly.~
@47118 = ~Yes, yes, let's not overdo it...~
@47119 = ~I'm gonna kill that flea-bitten mongrel. I'M GONNA KILL IT!~
@47120 = ~Please, don't hurt my dog! Please!~
@47121 = ~Nobody will hurt the dog. He did what came naturally. I've spoken to Frair. He'll keep it leashed from now on.~
@47122 = ~It's just a dog. Killing it will give no one satisfaction.~
@47123 = ~I'll slay the mangy beast myself.~
@47124 = ~The loss is still on your head, Mattroun. If you hadn't fallen asleep... Eh. What's done is done.~
@47125 = ~On my honor, on Lathander himself, I swear to you, Dare will never eat anything I don't personally hand him ever again. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for your wisdom and your kindness.~
@47126 = ~Good.~ [BD47126]
@47127 = ~You're too late. You're too late! I sent him away, across the moat. He's free and safe from you—you barbarians! Savages!~
@47128 = ~You shouldn't've done that, priest.~
@47129 = ~I regret nothing! Slay me if you must, but Dare will live, my child will live! That's all that matters. The only thing.~
@47130 = ~Thank you for resolving this, <CHARNAME>. I've little to offer you right now. Return in a day's time. I'll cobbled together something suitable to reward your effort. Until then, farewell.~
@47131 = ~That mangy sack of fleas! I'll kill it. I'M GONNA KILL IT!~
@47132 = ~The dog—of course. It all makes sense.~
@47133 = ~I'll not kill a dumb animal over this—certainly not a dumb animal that's proven itself happy to use its fangs on crusaders.~
@47134 = ~I knew it! I KNEW IT!~
@47135 = ~It's good to know, I suppose, though it matters little enough now. My thanks for resolving this, <CHARNAME>. I've little to offer you right now. Return in a day's time. I'll cobbled together something suitable to reward your effort. Until then, farewell.~
@47136 = ~Indeed.~
@47137 = ~I owe you a great debt, <CHARNAME>. You saved my child.~
@47138 = ~You owe me nothing, Frair. Regardless of what they do—regardless of what we must sometimes do to them—animals are true innocents. They don't comprehend good and evil. I'd sooner say I stole the ham than Dare.~
@47139 = ~You owe me nothing. Even if you did, I doubt you're in much of a position to pay the debt. Just keep an eye on your dog, all right?~
@47140 = ~I would speak to you regarding the half-elf Senderin. She's in the northeast corner of the courtyard—you know her?~
@47141 = ~You are right, on both counts. What have you got for me?~
@47142 = ~I don't know what you're talking about, and it would better for all if you ceased talking of it at all. Understood?~
@47143 = ~Feh. An innocent's teeth and claws rip the flesh as readily as any evildoer's.~ [BD47143]
@47144 = ~A close eye. When the stores run low, they may turn to... alternative food sources.~ [BD47144]

@47146 = ~Subtle, <CHARNAME>. Very subtle.~ [BD47146]
@47147 = ~For my part, I'll see that Dare is leashed, or at the very least not let him run free without watching him carefully. This situation will not repeat itself.~
@47148 = ~I can ask no better. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>, Frair.~
@47149 = ~What situation is that? I'm sorry, my friend, but I haven't the foggiest notion what you're talking about.~
@47150 = ~See that it doesn't. I'll not look a fool on that fleabitten cur's behalf. Luck to you.~
@47151 = ~Please, accept a small token of thanks.~
@47152 = ~Keep it, my friend. If you truly don't need it, then sell it if you can. Use the money to feed Dare.~
@47153 = ~I'm a decent enough person, but I'm no saint. I'll not say no to such an offer.~
@47154 = ~And I would like to accept that small token. Or any larger tokens you may have.~
@47155 = ~Hand it over.~
@47156 = ~You are too kind, <CHARNAME>. By far.~
@47157 = ~Your generosity is beyond reproach. I'll not soon forget this, <CHARNAME>. If there's anything you ever need, please let me know. I'll do everything in my power to provide it. Until then, farewell.~
@47158 = ~We're done here, then? Good. Let's go.~
@47159 = ~And to you, my friend.~
@47160 = ~Here, take it, take it all. Dare is all that matters.~
@47161 = ~When you put it like that, I cannot bring myself to accept this. Use it to care for the dog.~
@47162 = ~A pleasure doing business. Luck to you, Frair.~
@47163 = ~The cur matters little to me. Your gold is another matter altogether.~
@47164 = ~It is a good thing you do, <CHARNAME>. Boo approves.~ [BD47164]

@47166 = ~If I had more to give you, I would, without hesitation. But you have everything that was once mine—all but that which matters most. So I thank you, in spite of everything. Thank you. Farewell.~
@47167 = ~Ah, yes, I understand you perfectly. So I'll say this and nothing more: If there's anything you ever need, please let me know. I'll do everything in my power to provide it. Until then, farewell.~
@47168 = ~Is this about the horses again? I told them, I can't waste use energy healing them when I might be called upon to help actual people at any moment.~
@47169 = ~Dare is an animal—an adorable one, but an animal nonetheless. Yet you care deeply about him. Senderin and her son care deeply about their horses. Those horses will die without your help.~
@47170 = ~Perhaps a donation to the church would change your mind? Say, 50 gold?~
@47171 = ~You're a man of faith, but even a man of faith must eat. What if I offered you 100 gold pieces to heal the horses?~
@47172 = ~I don't suppose 200 gold pieces would change your mind?~
@47173 = ~Sensible. I'll leave you to your business, then.~
@47174 = ~I'll take the gold, as there's always a use for it. You saved Dare, so I will do the same for Senderin's nags, though I assure you her feelings for them are nothing like mine for Dare. Come on, boy! Let's go heal some horses.~
@47175 = ~Here you go. ~
@47176 = ~That changes nothing, I'm afraid. I have a duty to preserve life wherever I can—sentient life first, animals a distant second. Dare excepted, of course. Now if you'll excuse me— Come, Dare!~
@47177 = ~If you'll excuse me, I'll go deal with this matter immediately.~
@47178 = ~Take care. There are crusaders about. Come, Dare!~
@47179 = ~What Senderin and that wretched child of hers feel for their horses cannot compare to my love for Dare. But as you saved his life. I'll not refuse you this. Come, Dare! We've nags to minister to.~
@47180 = ~You cost me my child. I've nothing to say to you. ~
@47181 = ~I did what I had to do, Frair. An innocent man was wrongly accused.~
@47182 = ~I've done you a favor. You invest too much in that animal.~
@47183 = ~It was just a dog. An animal, nothing more.~
@47184 = ~A dead man. It would have cost neither him nor you anything to let his accusers believe in his guilt. I don't want to look at you. Begone!~
@47185 = ~I don't want to talk to you. Begone!~
@47186 = ~Hey! Boo is right here, you know...~ [BD47186]
@47187 = ~There are few things worse than a man who thinks his pet is a person. Oh, wait. Boo says that's not right.~ [BD47187]
@47188 = ~Well met. I've collected what I could as thanks for your help with the ham theft. It's not much, but it's the best I could manage.~
@47189 = ~Keep it, my friend. We're all in this together.~
@47190 = ~Not much is still something. I'll take it.~
@47191 = ~It will have to suffice.~
@47192 = ~We must put aside our personal goals to work together for the common good.~ [BD47192]
@47193 = ~Gods, monk! Is there any hollow platitude you won't offer up as solemn wisdom?~ [BD47193]
@47194 = ~Do not hold the fool's desperate clutching for significance against him, Safana. He is as his goddess has made him.~ [BD47194]
@47195 = ~Selûne has blessed me with many gifts, Sharran. You are fortunate patience is among them.~ [BD47195]
@47196 = ~Not taking the reward's a noble gesture, <CHARNAME>. Would've been nice if you'd made it before I went to the effort of collecting it, but... Eh. Take care. There are crusaders about.~
@47197 = ~He's right. There are crusaders about, and we should really be doing something about them, don't you think?~
@47198 = ~Taking scraps from those who have little enough already, <CHARNAME>? I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.~
@47199 = ~We do what we can. Good work deserves recognition. If there's anything else you need from me, I'll be around. Luck to you, and take care. There are crusaders about.~
@47200 = ~Yeah. It will.~
@47201 = ~Ja, ja, this is the place. The elf—the half-elf lass's seven-legged spider is here.~ [BD47201]
@47202 = ~All right! LET'S DO THIS!~
@47203 = ~Don't like this place. All the moaning. Ugh.~ [BD47203]

@47205 = ~You can't hear the dead? Lucky.~ [BD47205]
@47206 = ~Boo doesn't like this place... He had a bad experience with a web once. He does not want to talk about it.~ [BD47206]
@47207 = ~Webs. No matter how far I go, they are there to snare me. I despise them.~ [BD47207]
@47208 = ~I like you, <CHARNAME>. You always visit such interesting places.~ [BD47208]
@47209 = ~I think we have more important things to do than this. Don't you? ~
@47210 = ~This is foolish. The gods know what Caelar's doing while we waste our time here. ~
@47211 = ~What idiocy have you simians gotten me mixed up in now? (Why do I ask? They know nothing, at least nothing of value...) ~
@47212 = ~That sound... That is no spider.~ [BD47212]
@47213 = ~Anyone else think it's about time we got the hells out of here? ~
@47214 = ~Now that is a beetle.~ [BD47214]
@47215 = ~A rhino beetle. It is here to feed on the spiders' eggs. It would be best for us if we let it. ~
@47216 = ~Bugs only care about eating. Grab some spider eggs. They'll draw the big one away from the hole.~ [BD47216]
@47217 = ~Best attend the boisterous little beast. Beating blockades is very much her bailiwick.~ [BD47217]
@47218 = ~Nicely done. ~
@47219 = ~That was time well spent.~ [BD47219]
@47220 = ~We got a decent shield out of it.~

@47222 = ~Better spent that way than dying.~
@47223 = ~I suppose that's true enough. Let's go. ~
@47224 = ~Let's.~

@47231 = ~I don't know if this bug had a butt, but if it did, it's been thoroughly kicked!~ [BD47231]
@47232 = ~First spiders, then beetles. Best we leave this place before the ankhegs appear.~ [BD47232]
@47233 = ~Would that there were another way to have ended this.~ [BD47233]
@47234 = ~Well, I'm thoroughly disgusted. You?~ [BD47234]
@47235 = ~I'll still take beetles over spiders.~ [BD47235]
@47236 = ~Even the mighty rhinoceros beetle cannot prevail against the might of Thayan magick. (You were a fool to try, bug.) ~
@47237 = ~Anything more? Or have we categorically conquered this cavern's cornucopia of cockamamie creepy-crawlies?~ [BD47237]
@47238 = ~Beetle's good eats. Try some.~ [BD47238]
@47239 = ~Dear Cloakshadow, I'm going to be smelling this place forEVER...~ [BD47239]
@47240 = ~Good. Now we can do what we should have been doing all this time. ~
@47241 = ~When this is all over, I'm sure I'll look back on this all and laugh. ~
@47242 = ~Hah! Insects crushed beneath my heel have rarely been so literal. ~
@47243 = ~W-we should be-be doing other things n-now. ~
@47244 = ~Ho ho! These bugs tried to eat the lion of Luskan, but they didn't like the taste!~ [BD47244]
@47245 = ~May the Morninglord's radiance engulf you. How may I be of assistance?~
@47246 = ~You're a priest, right? Can you heal me?~
@47247 = ~Do you have any healing potions for sale?~
@47248 = ~I need nothing right now, thank you.~
@47249 = ~I fear not. Everything I had went to tending to our wounded. Try speaking to Frair Tajik. He should be able to help you better than I.~
@47250 = ~Go in peace.~
@47251 = ~You there! Help me move these bodies, please. ~
@47252 = ~Where do you want them?~

@47255 = ~We need to get them to the altar in the next chamber so I can prepare them for burial.~
@47256 = ~I hope their lives in the next world meet better ends than in this one. Let's get them to the altar.~
@47257 = ~Fine, but I'd better get some serious good-soul points for this.~
@47258 = ~Do it yourself, if you must. I'll not waste my time on the dead.~
@47259 = ~Thank you, thank you.~
@47260 = ~If you'll not help, then stay out of the way. Be off with you.~
@47261 = ~I thank you for your help. Please place the bodies on the altar. I'll handle things from there.~
@47262 = ~You have my thanks. I've exhausted myself bringing all our dead here. A horrible thing to say, but, sadly, all too true.~
@47263 = ~I'm glad I could be of service. These people have earned a peaceful rest.~
@47264 = ~You obviously recognize the effort this sort of transport takes. I'll leave it to you to determine a fitting payment for my work.~
@47265 = ~I'm often called upon to finish tasks the weak cannot.~
@47266 = ~I'm afraid I don't have anything to spare. Our resources have been stretched beyond any reasonable limit as it is. Which makes me hesitant to do this...~
@47267 = ~I must ask one more thing of you. I recognize Kendra here. She's the sister of a guardsman, Tharantis. Could you tell him of her passing?~
@47268 = ~I would be honored to discharge this solemn duty.~
@47269 = ~Forgive me, but wouldn't that be something better done by you?~
@47270 = ~I haven't time to do your duties as well as my own. Take care of it yourself.~
@47271 = ~That's fair enough. Thank you for your help. May the Morninglord light your way.~
@47272 = ~I have more survivors to inform. Too many. It would help a great deal if you could speak to Tharantis. He patrols the courtyard.~
@47273 = ~I would be honored to discharge this solemn duty.~
@47274 = ~Fine. I'll tell him. ~
@47275 = ~It would help you a great deal, no doubt. I fail to see it improving my situation in any tangible way. Do your duty, Dawnbringer, and leave me to mine.~
@47276 = ~Thank you again. May the Morninglord light your way. ~
@47277 = ~Something I can do for you? ~
@47278 = ~Do you have a sister named Kendra?~
@47279 = ~Nothing right now. Carry on.~
@47280 = ~May fortune rise to you.~
@47281 = ~What kind of mess has she gotten herself into this time?~
@47282 = ~I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but Kendra's been killed.~
@47283 = ~The good news is she won't be getting into any further messes. The bad news, well...~
@47284 = ~The kind from which there is no escape.~
@47285 = ~You're saying—Kendra's dead? No, no, you're wrong! It's someone else. Not Kendra—not my little sister...~
@47286 = ~No... Nothing springs to mind. Thanks for asking, though. Much appreciated.~
@47287 = ~I fear you are right, my friend. I have seen her upset many times. This is what it looks like.~ [BD47287]
@47288 = ~When you danced, you summoned spirits to fight for you. I do something similar with my magic. Are you a shaman as well?~
@47289 = ~Never fear, the Morninglord will guide us to his remains.~
@47290 = ~Isabella and Ikros

I've destroyed the vampire.

With a single swift motion, I impaled the vampire's corpse. All the vitality leached out of it at once, and what was left of the body sagged in upon itself. It will hunt here no more.~
@47291 = ~I'm still investigating the menhirs. I'll return when I know more.~
@47292 = ~I'll be on my way.~
@47293 = ~We all face loss eventually. I'm sorry you've had to face yours.~
@47294 = ~We were going to see this siege through together. I swore... I swore I would protect her. She laughed and said she'd protect ME.~
@47295 = ~I'm very sorry.~
@47296 = ~I know this comes as a shock, but your sister died fighting for what she believed to be right. Honor her memory and do the same.~
@47297 = ~Pull yourself together. You're a fighter, not a milkmaid. ~
@47298 = ~You're right. I... I'll not dishonor my sister's memory. My heart is broken, but my will is strong. The crusade will pay for what they've done this <DAYNIGHTALL>. ~
@47299 = ~Thank you for telling me this. Now I've a favor to ask of you. Kendra wore a gold chain around her neck. May I have it?~
@47300 = ~I helped prepare her body, but I saw no such chain. I'll ask Junia if she found it.~
@47301 = ~A gold chain, you say? Sure, I'll find that. For you. I'll find it for you. It's your sister's, after all. You should have it.~
@47302 = ~If I have time I'll try to find it, but I make no promises.~
@47303 = ~Thank you. Please excuse me now. I need some time alone.~
@47304 = ~I smell goblin. Dead goblin.~
@47305 = ~I smell goblin. Dead goblin. Best kind.~ [BD47305]
@47306 = ~The malicious monster makes itself manifest. You see what I had to put up with?~ [BD47306]
@47307 = ~Wonder what happened to them.~ [BD47307]
@47308 = ~Can you find out? They might be able to tell us something useful.~
@47309 = ~Do you really? I can't say I care overmuch.~
@47310 = ~I'm more interested in making sure whatever it was doesn't happen to us.~
@47311 = ~They were killed. What more need we know? Check the bodies, see if they have anything you can use.~
@47312 = ~Call their ghosts? Yeah, all right.~ [BD47312]
@47313 = ~You wouldn't. You're no goblin. These aren't your kind lying dead on the ground.~ [BD47313]
@47314 = ~Do they have any equipment you can use?~
@47315 = ~Can you do that dance thing, get their spirits to reveal themselves?~
@47316 = ~Thank the gods for that.~
@47317 = ~How good of you to notice.~
@47318 = ~Whatever killed these goblins left little of use behind.~ [BD47318]
@47319 = ~Armor's no good. That axe looks all right.~
@47320 = ~Armor's no good. That axe looks all right. Stand back. I'm calling their ghosts. Find out what happened.~ [BD47320]
@47321 = ~Is that a good idea?~
@47322 = ~What can we expect from these spirits when they arrive?~
@47323 = ~They're dead. Leave it alone. We've better things to do.~
@47324 = ~Depends how the spirits feel about being called. They usually don't like it much. Stay back.~ [BD47324]
@47325 = ~I can do nothin'. It's usually the easiest thing to do.~ [BD47325]
@47326 = ~Huh? Whuzzis now?~ [BD47326]
@47327 = ~Fouleye? What the hells is happenin', Fouleye?~ [BD47327]

@47335 = ~Shut it, Puke, y'great crevasse! I wanna know what's going on.~ [BD47335]
@47336 = ~I'm with you, Gar. I wanna know what's happ'nin' too.~ [BD47336]

@47353 = ~The Puke's not goin' anywhere till he gets his claws 'round yer dung daughter throat!~ [BD47353]
@47354 = ~Yeah, we know 'er. We heard the stories. Never believed'm, but here she is, the Grubdoubler's whelp-monster! How could you do what you did? Tell me! How?~ [BD47354]
@47355 = ~You call M'Khiin a monster?~
@47356 = ~Pot, meet kettle. Pleased to meet you, kettle. My, but your complexion is striking in its darkness.~
@47357 = ~What's he talking about, M'Khiin? What did you do?~
@47358 = ~You will answer her questions, goblin. Not the other way around.~
@47359 = ~She's no true goblin, that one. Somethin' wrong with her inside.~ [BD47359]

@47361 = ~What kinda goblin does that? None, that's what!~ [BD47361]
@47362 = ~Or a most remarkable one.~
@47363 = ~Is this true, M'Khiin? Did you really leave your tribe?~
@47364 = ~Or a most remarkable one. You abandoned your own people, M'Khiin? There is a strength to you even greater than I suspected.~
@47365 = ~I'll not listen to you disparage your obvious better any longer. Send them away, M'Khiin. You shouldn't have to put up with this.~
@47366 = ~Callin' the Puke weak? That makes the Puke blood-mad!~ [BD47366]
@47367 = ~I think lots of things make the Puke mad. Tell us what happened to you. NOW.~ [BD47367]
@47368 = ~We should tell 'er, Gar. I don't like the way she's lookin' at us.~ [BD47368]

@47372 = ~I would've slain them first, actually. But you're right, I would have left. I assumed the drow took you, but no—you're stronger than that, aren't you?~
@47373 = ~Really? Well—good. Now, you four. What happened to you? What killed you?~ [BD47373]
@47374 = ~Everyone thinks goblins are weak. Usually they're right.~ [BD47374]

@47376 = ~Tell'm, Fouleye. Tell 'em how we ended up dead.~ [BD47376]
@47377 = ~I'm not tellin'm anything.~ [BD47377]
@47378 = ~How did we die, anyway? I remember a whole lotta yellin' and then... nothin'.~ [BD47378]

@47381 = ~Ouch. That's gotta hurt.~
@47382 = ~The favorable aspects of a split skull are debatable, at best.~

@47390 = ~You've heard enough, M'Khiin. Send these wretches back from whence they came.~
@47391 = ~The Puke doesn't got friends!~ [BD47391]

@47403 = ~Loot! Please, give us loot!~
@47404 = ~There can be no mercy for such as you.~

@47409 = ~You've certainly no need of it now. I thank you.~
@47410 = ~You've certainly no need of it now. I thank you.~

@47412 = ~You may be right. Finish them off, M'Khiin.~
@47413 = ~Yes. YES! Silence, wonderful, amazing, GLORIOUS silence! It worked!~
@47414 = ~Yes. YES! Silence, wonderful, amazing, GLORIOUS silence! It worked! But—something's wrong. Adoy's gone, but—what's happening to me...?~ [BD47414]
@47415 = ~Well. This isn't ideal. But I'll take it over having someone else endlessly babbling in my brain.~ [BD47415]
@47416 = ~Oh, gods... What have I done?~ [BD47416]
@47417 = ~It's not so bad, Neera. You're going to get through this. I'll make sure of it.~

@47666 = ~Watch it, wizard. You're on thin ice.~
@47667 = ~I seen him. I seen what he does. Hides in the bushes while Ravoc 'n the others do all the work. Shouts Caelar's name as loud as any but quivers like a mouse when it's time t'do her work. Complains about how hard this life is for him.~
@47668 = ~Shouts Caelar's name loud as any, but shakes like a mouse when it's time t'do her work. Complains about how hard this life is for him. He's weak.~
@47669 = ~Do you believe he warned Innisfall of the crusade's coming?~
@47670 = ~It does take a certain, let's say dogged determination, to pursue a life in service, doesn't it? Thank you, my friend. You've been very helpful.~
@47671 = ~Agreed. I'll leave you now.~
@47672 = ~Corinth, turn on the crusade? He hasn't got the stones. He hasn't even got one stone. Useless. ~
@47673 = ~Thank you. You've been most helpful.~
@47674 = ~No stones? Unfortunate. Thanks for the help, orc. Your insights have been invaluable.~
@47675 = ~Don't discount him too quickly. Cowards have their uses. I'll leave you to your work now.~
@47676 = ~Sure. Whatever. ~
@47677 = ~Stop it. I don't like bein' looked at.~
@47678 = ~You lookin' at me? You lookin' at me? I don't see no one else here. You must be lookin' at me.~
@47679 = ~I was, but only because I have a question for you.~
@47680 = ~I actually was looking at you. Pray forgive me, my friend. I'll leave you alone.~
@47681 = ~Was I looking at you? I don't think I was.~
@47682 = ~You have a problem with that, orc?~
@47683 = ~A goblin! Everyone, beware, there's a goblin loose in the camp!~
@47684 = ~Wait! Wait. The crusade embraces all who would walk in light. Drow, orcs, goblins. Gnomes. Damn it, Delton, you're better than this! Be a better person. For Caelar. Do it for the Shining Lady. Yes.~
@47685 = ~You don't know? Of course you don't; you couldn't or you wouldn't have asked. You should talk to Leopas, yes. He knows all about it.~
@47686 = ~He didn't do it, you know. I don't believe he did it. Corinth wouldn't be so foolish as to betray us. ~
@47687 = ~You believe Valis lies when she claims Corinth warned Innisfall of the crusade's arrival?~
@47688 = ~Slow down there. Who is this Corinth you speak of?~
@47689 = ~Good to know. Nice talking to you. I'll be on my way now.~
@47690 = ~Who are you talking about?~
@47691 = ~He refers to a ranger accused of betraying the crusade. Their commander, Leopas, tasked you with determining the truth of the accusations, remember?~ [BD47691]
@47692 = ~You aren't here to talk to me about Corinth? I thought Commander Leopas had you looking into Valis's claims—which aren't true. I don't think they're true, anyway. I just don't.~
@47693 = ~You think Valis is lying?~
@47694 = ~Ah, yes. I remember now.~
@47695 = ~Your opinion on the matter—on any matter—means nothing to me. Fare you well.~
@47696 = ~Didn't say that, didn't say that. Just saying she's not telling the truth for some reason. Don't know why. Maybe even she doesn't know why.~
@47697 = ~Look, Corinth isn't the most steadfast guy around; I know that. I know that. He's in this for the money, not the mission. But he's in it, see? He's in it. So he's got—had, so he had family in Innisfall. That doesn't prove anything.~
@47698 = ~Corinth has family in Innisfall?~
@47699 = ~Indeed it doesn't. You have my thanks. We may speak again.~
@47700 = ~Cease your prattling, you gibbering wretch! I don't want to hear it!~
@47701 = ~Yeah, all right, may Caelar's light guide you always and like that.~
@47702 = ~Corinth has family in Innisfall? Where'd you hear that?~
@47703 = ~You said it just now.~
@47704 = ~You hadn't heard about that? Everyone's talking about it.~
@47705 = ~This is ridiculous. I'll not waste any more time on you.~
@47706 = ~Well, yeah, he had family in Innisfall. And Innisfall managed to, you know, run like the hells just a few minutes before the crusade arrived. That doesn't prove anything. Nothing, that's what it proves. What I'm saying, if you listen to me, what I'm saying is, Corinth isn't gonna turn on the crusade. He just isn't. FACT. ~
@47707 = ~You've been most helpful. Thank you.~
@47708 = ~I believe you. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be on my way.~
@47709 = ~Are you finished talking? Because I assure you, I am done listening.~
@47710 = ~They are? Really? Huh.~
@47711 = ~He wouldn't turn on us. He wouldn't. Uh, what...?~
@47712 = ~Hm? What? Oh! It's you. He didn't do it. ~
@47713 = ~Yes, you mentioned that earlier. It was most helpful.~
@47714 = ~Who didn't do what?~
@47715 = ~I'm afraid he did.~
@47716 = ~No. We are not going to go through this again.~
@47717 = ~So you're gonna tell Leopas Corinth is innocent? ~
@47718 = ~I'll tell him the truth.~
@47719 = ~I haven't decided yet.~
@47720 = ~Corinth isn't innocent.~
@47721 = ~Yeah, sure, sure. The truth. That should work. Good. I'll see you later, then.~
@47722 = ~Fair enough, fair enough, yeah, that's fair. Good. I'll see you later then, right? Good.~
@47723 = ~Aw, naw, naw, no, you think he did it? Betrayed the crusade? No. Uh-uh. Not him. He's not that stupid.~
@47724 = ~Ho, there. I am Damarr. ~
@47725 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. Pleased to make your acquaintance.~
@47726 = ~Good to know you, Damarr. I'm investigating the charges against Corinth.~
@47727 = ~And I am leaving.~
@47728 = ~Seriously? <CHARNAME>? You know you share a name with the hero of Baldur's Gate, right?~
@47729 = ~I am aware of it.~
@47730 = ~Painfully so. I loathe that <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <PRO_HESHE>'s made my life a living nightmare.~
@47731 = ~This is not a conversation I care to have.~
@47732 = ~You may want to consider calling yourself something else. The Baldur's Gate <CHARNAME> is... not beloved 'round here.~
@47733 = ~I see. What can I help you with?~
@47734 = ~What can you tell me about Valis and Corinth?~
@47735 = ~Nothing at the moment.~
@47736 = ~Do you think Corinth warned Innisfall about the crusade?~
@47737 = ~Were they both to die, I'd not mourn their loss.~
@47738 = ~Hold thy tongue, girl. You do not know to whom you speak.~ [BD47738]
@47739 = ~I'm sorry, I thought you were the one assigned to determine Corinth's guilt.~
@47740 = ~I am tasked with that duty, it is true.~
@47741 = ~Oh, Corinth! Right. I thought you said—something else. Yes. I am looking into that. You know him? Or Valis?~
@47742 = ~I am. I was trying to make a joke. In retrospect, I see that wasn't the best idea. So do you know them? Could Corinth have betrayed the crusade?~
@47743 = ~This is not something I wish to discuss. Farewell.~
@47744 = ~I know them both well enough, I think. ~
@47745 = ~Do you believe Corinth did what Valis claims?~
@47746 = ~Any insights you'd care to share?~
@47747 = ~What do you know of them? Tell me everything.~
@47748 = ~Nice talking to you.~
@47749 = ~All right, here's how it is. It's no secret Corinth isn't as... committed to Caelar's cause as some of us. Certainly not the way Valis is. Could he have warned Innisfall about the crusade coming?~
@47750 = ~It's possible. It's definitely possible. But—it's not like we lost people taking Innisfall. It's not SO great a crime that he deserves to die—assuming he even did anything, which I don't think you can assume.~
@47751 = ~Would Valis lie to frame Corinth? She obviously holds him in contempt.~
@47752 = ~I'm not assuming anything. Belief is not enough for me—I have to KNOW what's true and what isn't.~
@47753 = ~I assume nothing.~
@47754 = ~Valis has no love for Corinth. I don't know how far she'd go to see him dead. And we are talking about Corinth's life and death here. If he's found guilty of betraying Caelar, he'll be heading to Avernus before any of us do.~
@47755 = ~Heh. I can see how you might end up feeling that way.~
@47756 = ~Do you know them? Any insight you can offer would be much appreciated.~
@47757 = ~It's been... something. I'm not sure what it's been, and it smells pretty bad, but it's definitely something.~
@47758 = ~I don't wish to speak of this right now. Perhaps later.~
@47759 = ~Is there anything I can do to help?~
@47760 = ~I've seen enough death myself. I don't like Corinth, but I don't dislike him so much that I'd see him die, not for what he's accused of.~
@47761 = ~Thank you, Damarr. You've been very helpful.~
@47762 = ~You've given me a lot to think about.~
@47763 = ~I've had enough of this. Perhaps we shall speak more of it another time. For now, however, I will take my leave.~
@47764 = ~I try. Take care of yourself. Caelar's enemies are all around us. We are safe in her light, but... well, we could always be a little safer, you know? ~
@47765 = ~Back for more? ~
@47766 = ~I would speak to you about Valis and Corinth.~
@47767 = ~No, I'm really not.~
@47768 = ~Yeah. I'm still trying to figure out this thing with the rangers.~
@47769 = ~You have more to give?~
@47770 = ~Yes. You seem very reasonable for a crusader.~
@47771 = ~I've nothing more to say to you.~
@47772 = ~A pity. I enjoyed our time together. Fare thee well.~
@47773 = ~Valis, Corinth, Valis, Corinth. I'm sick of hearing those names. Do people talk about anyone else around here?~ [BD47773]
@47774 = ~This is wisdom. Take care.~
@47775 = ~No more reasonable than you, surely?~
@47776 = ~I sometimes have... doubts, about Caelar's goals. Not their righteousness, necessarily, but whether they're actually achievable.~
@47777 = ~Much more reasonable than that, I'd hope. Excuse me, I've got to go figure this thing with Valis and Corinth out.~
@47778 = ~No, no more reasonable than me. Who is a crusader. Yes.~
@47779 = ~Far more reasonable than me. Believe me, you have no idea how insane I really am.~
@47780 = ~I am here for my own benefit. In that, I seem to be a minority. Most of our fellows seem more than willing to die for the Shining Lady.~
@47781 = ~It's true. You really don't.~ [BD47781]
@47782 = ~It's all right. Not all of us are blinded by Caelar's light. Most are, it's true. You don't march into a Hell if you don't BELIEVE, no matter how much you're being paid.~
@47783 = ~You aren't?~
@47784 = ~I'm surprised to hear you say this. I thought I was the only one who wasn't, shall we say, a true believer.~
@47785 = ~Really? Tell me more.~
@47786 = ~Most are, it's true. You don't march into a Hell if you don't BELIEVE, no matter how much you're being paid.~
@47787 = ~But I've been here a month. Haven't gone to Avernus yet. When the time comes... Well, we'll see how many truly follow Caelar then. If it happens.~
@47788 = ~Take care of yourself, Damarr. There are dark times ahead.~
@47789 = ~I hope she's right and all this is in service to the greater good.~
@47790 = ~I can't imagine it'll be much longer before we know what's happening. For myself, I will focus on survival.~
@47791 = ~Darker for some than for others.~
@47792 = ~Do my eyes deceive me? Are you actually flirting with this creature, <CHARNAME>?~ [BD47792]
@47793 = ~This isn't the time and it definitely isn't the place. Let's go.~
@47794 = ~No harm in a little flirting. It's what comes later that can be dangerous. I'll leave you to your business now. Take care.~
@47795 = ~And better days beyond them. We just have to survive long enough to enjoy them. It was good talking with you. Perhaps we can do it again sometime.~
@47796 = ~You and me both. Take care of yourself. Perhaps we'll talk again when this is all over.~
@47797 = ~Nothing you've not heard many times before, I'm sure. Nice talking to you. Take care.~
@47798 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! What can I do for you this fine <DAYNIGHTALL>?~
@47799 = ~You know what's happening with Valis and Corinth?~
@47800 = ~I'm looking for Caelar.~
@47801 = ~Do you know where I could get a drink around here? I am parched.~
@47802 = ~Nothing. Go away. Now.~
@47803 = ~I know sheep dung from my mam's good silver!~
@47804 = ~I know sheep dung from my mam's good silver! Valis says Corinth warned Innisfall the crusade was a-coming and lost us potential conscripts and supplies. Now, Corinth never took a shine to me. Says Caelar's got her hand up my backside—I wish!—and I don't have a thought of my own in my head.~
@47805 = ~But Valis, she don't think too highly of me neither. One time we were marching through the Troll Claws and she put porridge in my boots while I was asleep. Well, she said it was porridge. I didn't want to look too closely, you know what I mean?~
@47806 = ~I guess what I'm saying is, I don't know whether Corinth did what Valis says or not, and I wouldn't be too sad if the pair of 'em took a flying leap off the edge of Toril!~
@47807 = ~That was... most enlightening. Thank you.~
@47808 = ~That was no help whatsoever, but thanks for trying.~
@47809 = ~I am beginning to agree with you. You may go now.~
@47810 = ~No problem, no problem at all, anything for a fellow servant of the Lady. Hey—may Caelar shine upon you! Take care now!~
@47811 = ~I could go; I could do that, yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, but then I'd be the one Leopas was looking at cock-eyed. He told me to man my post! So I'll just stay here if it's all the same to you. May the Shining Lady's light guide you always!~
@47812 = ~Lots of people are! She got here a week, maybe two weeks, maybe three weeks, maybe a month or more ago and went into Dragonspear. As far as I know, she's still in there.~
@47813 = ~Thank you. You've been most helpful.~
@47814 = ~Have you any thoughts on this matter with Valis and Corinth? You know them?~
@47815 = ~As far as you know?~
@47816 = ~Interesting. You may leave.~
@47817 = ~It's not like I'm part of her inner circle. I wish, you know? But no, no, I'm just a normal fella, I'm not outstanding in my field, so here I am, out standing in the field! Hey, you take care of yourself now, you hear? May Caelar guide you and yours from the darkness.~
@47818 = ~Ja! This crusading, she is thirsty work. Old Voghiln wouldn't say no to a mug of ale. And he'd say "ja ja ja" to a cask of it, ho ho!~ [BD47818]
@47819 = ~Now that is a good question. I'm not a man of the grape, if you know what I mean. I mean I'm no great drinker of anything that's not water. But I hear there's a dwarf—it's always a dwarf, isn't it?—there's a dwarf named Heath Lodefinder; they say you want a drink, he's the man to talk to.~
@47820 = ~You have yourself a great <DAYNIGHTALL> now. May you be worthy in the Shining Lady's eyes.~
@47821 = ~Yeah? What do you want? ~
@47822 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you. I seek Caelar Argent. Do you know where I might find her?~
@47823 = ~Do you know Valis or Corinth? One of them is lying about the other. I'm trying to figure out which is which.~
@47824 = ~I have an urgent message for the Shining Lady. Tell me where she is.~
@47825 = ~I want many things, none of which you can provide.~
@47826 = ~Aye, I know, but knowing'll do you no good. She speaks to no one but her closest advisors of late.~
@47827 = ~She's in the castle, but you'll not find it easy to reach her. And by not easy, I really mean impossible. She speaks to no one but Hephernaan and the Revered Brothers of late. But hey, luck to you.~
@47828 = ~I'm sorry to hear that. But as I can provide nothing to you, perhaps you'd best push off, yeah?~
@47829 = ~Corinth is your best bet there. Valis is many things, most of them unpleasant, but she's no liar. That one doesn't have the patience for deception, or much else, truth be told.~
@47830 = ~Thank you. That's very helpful.~
@47831 = ~I know exactly what you mean. I talked to her. Thanks for the help.~
@47832 = ~You see much but speak little. I like that. I am in your debt.~
@47833 = ~Weren't nothing. If it were something, I'd have charged you for it. Be off with you now. ~
@47834 = ~There something I can help you with? ~
@47835 = ~I seek the Lady Caelar Argent.~
@47836 = ~Only if you have any insight into either Valis or Corinth.~
@47837 = ~Nothing at all.~
@47838 = ~Move along, then. Make yourself useful. But do it somewhere else.~
@47839 = ~Give it a day, maybe two, and it'll be the gods' problem. Valis'll put an arrow in Corinth's back first chance she gets.~
@47840 = ~Give it a day, maybe two, and it'll be the gods' problem. Valis'll put an arrow in Corinth's back first chance she gets. It's a shame, really. He's not a bad sort. Mind you, I wouldn't want to be partnered with him. Lazy bugger, or so they say.~
@47841 = ~I've heard people say that, yes.~
@47842 = ~Who's they?~
@47843 = ~They say that, do they?~
@47844 = ~Nobody. Just people. You know.~
@47845 = ~Now go, be about your business. You don't want to get caught standing round talking to me. That's just asking someone to rope you into doing something you'd rather not be doing. Take it easy—easy as you can.~
@47846 = ~Like I say, it'll all sort itself out soon enough.~
@47847 = ~They say it, all right. About Corinth? They say it a lot.~
@47848 = ~She's in the castle, but you won't be able to get to her. They say she only talks to that priest of hers, whatsisname, the Revered whatever Hephernaan.~
@47849 = ~Let's hear it then. Did Corinth betray the crusade? Or is Valis bearing false witness against her fellow ranger? ~
@47850 = ~In truth, I cannot say. The available evidence points to Corinth's guilt, but it's hardly compelling enough to justify a man's death.~
@47851 = ~Corinth did as Valis says. He warned Innisfall of our arrival, letting them evade the Shining Lady's grasp.~
@47852 = ~I've talked to enough people to know Valis cannot be trusted. Corinth is innocent.~
@47853 = ~I've given this a lot of thought. Hey, who's kidding who—I've lost sleep over it. But after careful examination of the facts, it's clear to me that Corinth is innocent of the crimes Valis accuses him of.~
@47854 = ~This hasn't been an easy task for me. Hells, who's kidding who? I've lost weight over it. But the truth is clear. Corinth betrayed his fellows at Innisfall.~
@47855 = ~They are both guilty.~
@47856 = ~Both are guilty. They conspired to allow the people of Innisfall to escape. It was only after Corinth threatened to expose them that Valis turned on him, doing as he would have done to her before he had the chance.~
@47857 = ~Deceiver! I'll see you dead for this, you and Corinth both!~ [BD47857]
@47858 = ~Kill her!~
@47859 = ~A regrettable but necessary end to this grim business. There is a lesson here, friends. Learn it well. I'll not tolerate traitors in our ranks. Go, reflect on what you've seen and prepare to see more of it. Soon, we will face our enemies.~ [BD47859]
@47860 = ~You have done me and the crusade a service ferreting out Valis's lies. All that she possessed is yours now.~
@47861 = ~You have done me a service. Thank you. As a reward, all that Corinth possessed is now yours.~
@47862 = ~I didn't, I swear I didn't!~
@47863 = ~I knew it! Let justice be done!~ [BD47863]
@47864 = ~Slay the traitor.~
@47865 = ~How is this possible? Explain yourself. ~
@47866 = ~They conspired together to allow the people of Innisfall to escape. Only after Corinth threatened to reveal their crime did Valis turn on him, doing as he would have done to her before he had the chance.~
@47867 = ~Oh, you want me to explain my decision? I thought you'd just, you know—accept it.~
@47868 = ~I owe you no explanations. This is my judgment, accept it or don't.~
@47869 = ~You think this a joke? Get out of my sight, you repellent dullard! And thank Caelar for watching over you—were we anywhere but here, you'd pay dearly for wasting my time with such nonsense!~
@47870 = ~Don't think he likes you.~ [BD47870]
@47871 = ~I hope you're pleased with yourself, <CHARNAME>. We've gained little playing this fool's game.~
@47872 = ~I see. Very well. Both Corinth and Valis are guilty. Slay them, in Caelar's name!~
@47873 = ~You've wasted my time. Thank Caelar for watching over you. In another place, at another time, I wouldn't hesitate to cut you down. Go, make yourself useful, if you can. I don't want to see you again.~
@47874 = ~I said I didn't want to see your face again. Begone.~
@47875 = ~Forgive me, sir. I'll be on my way.~
@47876 = ~Actually, you just said you didn't want to see me again. You didn't specify that it was my face that offended you. If I turn my back to you, we'll be all right, then?~
@47877 = ~We don't always get what we want.~
@47878 = ~Get out of here, you idiot halfwit!~
@47879 = ~I'll cut that jester's tongue from your skull, you gabbling buffoon!~
@47880 = ~Good. Be off with you.~
@47881 = ~Might I have a word? ~
@47882 = ~Of course, Corinth. What can I do for you?~
@47883 = ~Depends on the word. If it's "die!", you can keep it.~
@47884 = ~Take two: Go away.~
@47885 = ~There is much I'd say to you, but I'll not deny the one who saved my life a request as simple as that. Farewell.~ [BD47885]

@47887 = ~All life has value, Corinth. You have to believe that.~
@47888 = ~Then make it worth something. Do what you must do to find meaning in your actions.~
@47889 = ~It means little enough to me. Begone.~
@47890 = ~I thought I could manage this. Fight for Caelar, for the greater good. That was what I wanted to do. Her cause is righteous. I believe in her, but... Some of the things I've seen in her service... Some of the things I've done... ~

@47908 = ~You said it. They're a Daggerford detail—not used to the experience and discipline we get in Waterdeep.~
@47909 = ~Will you be able to whip them into shape?~
@47910 = ~You should send them back to Daggerford.~
@47911 = ~Place them at the front of the unit. They'll die in the first charge, but at least they'll tire the enemy out.~
@47912 = ~I'm doing my best, but I've other duties to attend to. This lot might have to get by on their own.~
@47913 = ~Ha! You've a wicked sense of humor there. You are joking, yes...?~
@47914 = ~I'd love to send them back to Daggerford but we need every soldier we can get. Even ones as useless as these.~
@47915 = ~Perhaps I could try training them for you?~
@47916 = ~Why don't I take over training for a bit? I certainly can't make them any worse.~
@47917 = ~Let me take a run at them. I'll show them real discipline.~
@47918 = ~Good luck with them, Vigilant. I have to be going.~
@47919 = ~I'll do my best. All right, troops, keep at it!~
@47920 = ~You're the hero of Baldur's Gate. Why not? Come talk to me when you've finished drilling 'em and we'll see how you did. Dismissed!~ [BD47920]
@47921 = ~Come talk to me when you've drilled all six of the soldiers and I'll see how you did. Dismissed!~
@47922 = ~I understand you'll be training me. ~
@47923 = ~That's right. Let's see what you can do, soldier. Attack one of your comrades!~
@47924 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@47925 = ~Whoa! Slow down there, soldier. You're out of control.~
@47926 = ~I think you killed them, soldier.~
@47927 = ~That sort of uncontrolled attack will get you and everyone around you killed.~
@47928 = ~Sorry, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I got a little carried away. ~
@47929 = ~If you can control and focus that energy, you'll be deadly on the battlefield. Let me show you some techniques. Hold your sword like this...~
@47930 = ~Rage is an asset in battle—IF it's focused. Let me show you how I'd destroy an enemy...~
@47931 = ~Your fighting style reminds me of my own. You enjoy killing, don't you? ~
@47932 = ~You need to calm down. Focus your attacks. Let's try this again.~
@47933 = ~Try holding your sword in your other hand. That will slow you down and make you think about what you're doing.~
@47934 = ~I sense something in you, soldier. A darkness that reminds me of my own. You like killing, don't you?~
@47935 = ~I... yes. I do enjoy it. I thought if I said so, though, they wouldn't let me in the militia.~
@47936 = ~Give in to that desire. Don't try to suppress your true nature. As you slay your enemies, you'll hear a calling in your soul. Answer it, if you dare.~
@47937 = ~I... I will. Thank you.~
@47938 = ~I... yes. I do enjoy it. I thought if I said so, though, they wouldn't let me in the militia.~
@47939 = ~You are what you are. Any attempt to suppress your true nature is doomed to fail. As you slay your enemies, you'll hear a calling in your soul. Answer it, if you dare.~
@47940 = ~How's this?~
@47941 = ~Much better. Keep practicing, soldier. ~
@47942 = ~Uh, okay. I guess I could try that. ~
@47943 = ~Keep practicing, soldier! ~
@47944 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! ~
@47945 = ~I'll keep practicing, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! ~
@47946 = ~Greetings, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. ~
@47947 = ~Let's get to it, Private. Attack one of your companions while I evaluate your technique.~
@47948 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@47949 = ~All right, that's enough. ~
@47950 = ~I think the training dummy fell asleep.~
@47951 = ~Are you fighting or dancing?~
@47952 = ~What do you think, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?~
@47953 = ~You're tentative in your attacks and you move around too much. Try weaving in place instead of skipping. And strike more forcefully.~
@47954 = ~Your style is similar to mine. Let me show you some techniques for getting past an enemy's guard. You can take them by surprise this way...~
@47955 = ~I want you to get in closer to the enemy and stab with more intent. Try that.~
@47956 = ~Your problem is you're not dodging enough. Try getting behind your enemy or spinning in place.~
@47957 = ~If you don't mind, I think I can teach the private some tricks. You've got the right idea, but you're not taking it far enough.~ [BD47957]
@47958 = ~You mean I should try to fight... well, dirtier? What if I kicked low, like this... and feinted off to one side...~
@47959 = ~That's it. Leave the honor to nobles. Fight to win.~ [BD47959]
@47960 = ~I will! Thank you!~
@47961 = ~You mean I should try to fight... well, dirtier? What if I kicked low, like this... and feinted off to one side... ~
@47962 = ~Now you're getting the idea. We don't fight for honor. We fight for our lives. We fight to win.~
@47963 = ~How's this?~
@47964 = ~Much better. Keep practicing and you'll do fine. ~
@47965 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! ~
@47966 = ~Well... okay, if you say so. ~
@47967 = ~Keep at it, soldier! ~
@47968 = ~Stab... stab... weave!~
@47969 = ~Ready to go, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! Just let me at the enemy! I'll kill them all! ~
@47970 = ~Easy there, Private. Let's see what you've got first. Attack!~
@47971 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@47972 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! Er, which recruit should I attack...?~
@47973 = ~It really doesn't matter. Just pick one and hit them.~
@47974 = ~The ugly one.~
@47975 = ~Are you stalling, soldier?~
@47976 = ~Any of them, just hurry up. You're wasting my time.~
@47977 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@47978 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! Would you like me to start with my sword or begin at range with my crossbow?~
@47979 = ~Sword.~
@47980 = ~Crossbow.~
@47981 = ~Are you trying to stall, Hester?~
@47982 = ~It doesn't matter. Attack something!~
@47983 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@47984 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! ...Uh, my weapon seems to be broken. Maybe you could train one of the other recruits and get back to me?~
@47985 = ~Are you stalling, soldier?~
@47986 = ~Try asking the enemy to come back when you're ready. See how far that gets you.~
@47987 = ~Attack a recruit or I attack you. Which would you prefer?~
@47988 = ~N-no, of course not. ~
@47989 = ~Every fighter gets nervous from time to time. There's no shame in it. I can teach you some tricks to help you focus.~
@47990 = ~You've never been in battle before, have you? ~
@47991 = ~You've never been in battle before, have you? ~
@47992 = ~Viconia, you look like you have something to say?~
@47993 = ~M'Khiin? You look like you've something to say.~
@47994 = ~Every soldier has to fight their nerves from time to time. You have to ignore everything around you and concentrate on why you're here.~
@47995 = ~If you're frightened of combat, imagine dying in as much gory detail as you can. Once you accept the idea, you'll stop fearing it.~
@47996 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Sorry, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. ~
@47997 = ~Every fighter gets nervous from time to time. There's no shame in it. I can teach you some tricks to help you focus.~

@48003 = ~If you're frightened of combat, imagine dying in as much gory detail as you can. Once you accept the idea, you'll stop fearing it.~
@48004 = ~Everyone fears death, young one. It's the natural state of mortals. Shar teaches that it's foolish to chase hope or plan overmuch for the future. Death comes to all of us in the end. It's what we do in the moment that matters.~ [BD48004]
@48005 = ~Shar teaches that it's foolish to chase hope or plan overmuch for the future. Death comes to us all in the end. It's what we do in the moment that matters.~
@48006 = ~So by trying to avoid battle and all that comes with it, I'm missing out on my life now...?~
@48007 = ~Life is loss. In the end, we lose our lives. Accept that truth and move forward.~ [BD48007]
@48008 = ~I... I'll try.~
@48009 = ~I think I understand. If I focus on why we're here, the injustices Caelar's wrought upon the Sword Coast, maybe I can ignore my nerves.~
@48010 = ~That's the spirit. Keep practicing and focus on the cause, not your fears.~
@48011 = ~I suppose I could try that. If I can't stop thinking these dark thoughts, I might as well embrace them. Thank you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@48012 = ~Thank you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I feel calmer already.~
@48013 = ~No, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, I haven't. I keep thinking about what might happen, if I'll get hurt or let my team down...~
@48014 = ~Every soldier has those fears. You're here because you feel a duty to serve, though, not because it's a safe or easy path. Remember that. ~
@48015 = ~I think I understand. By concentrating on the importance of my duty, maybe I can forget about my nerves. ~
@48016 = ~That's the spirit. Keep practicing and focus on the cause, not your fears.~
@48017 = ~Pain hurts, but it makes you stronger. Fear death and you'll never really live.~ [BD48017]
@48018 = ~But life doesn't end at death. I can pull back the veil and speak to the spirits of my kin from time to time. Do the best you can in life, but don't fear death.~
@48019 = ~I'm a faithful worshipper, and I'm not afraid of vanishing after death. But... it's nice to know the living will still be able to reach me.~
@48020 = ~I feel much better, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! ~
@48021 = ~G-g-good day, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. ~
@48022 = ~You seem nervous, soldier. Let's fix that right now, then. Attack a fellow recruit and show me what you've got!~
@48023 = ~Maybe a l-little bit. I don't have much combat experience. ~
@48024 = ~Let's fix that right now, then. Attack that training dummy and show me what you've got! ~
@48025 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! ~
@48026 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@48027 = ~All right, that's enough for now.~
@48028 = ~Why don't you try a slash next? Then maybe a jab?~
@48029 = ~Is that all you know how to do?~
@48030 = ~Well, <PRO_SIRMAAM>? How did I do?~
@48031 = ~You've got the basic forms, but you're repetitive. As you get more skilled, you'll get more creative, but for now, remember: Vary your attack patterns.~
@48032 = ~You obviously have a knack for memorizing attack patterns. Have you always found it easy to learn and memorize?~
@48033 = ~Dynaheir, have you anything to say to Garrold, here?~
@48034 = ~Edwin, can you offer Garrold any advice?~
@48035 = ~You're obviously good at memorizing patterns. Come up with a few variant attack forms and cycle through them on the battlefield.~
@48036 = ~Your form is good, but you need to hit harder and faster. Try moving through your attack pattern as quickly as possible, over and over again!~
@48037 = ~I'll try to remember that, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Thank you!~
@48038 = ~This young man seems more intelligent than most. Allow me to look at thine aura, soldier... I see much potential in thy abilities. Perhaps thou shouldst train with magic instead of steel.~ [BD48038]
@48039 = ~I see much potential in thine abilities, young man. Perhaps thous't should train with the battle mages instead of with steel.~
@48040 = ~I've always liked to study but never considered wizardry... Thank you! I'll visit the mages at once.~
@48041 = ~Yes. I wanted to continue my schooling but when the call went out for militia, I knew my duty was to serve.~
@48042 = ~I sense magical potential in you, similar to my own. You are wasted as a soldier—train with the battle mages instead.~
@48043 = ~I'm glad you think my routine is solid. I'll work on my speed.~
@48044 = ~It's obvious this weakling is no soldier. I've eaten chickens with thicker legs than his. He seems moderately intelligent, though. Get him into mage training. He may be of use some day.~
@48045 = ~He seems moderately intelligent, though. Get him away from these sword-swinging lunkheads and into a mage unit. He might do less harm there.~
@48046 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL>, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@48047 = ~All right, soldier, enough small talk. Take on one of your fellow recruits and I'll advise you on your technique.~
@48048 = ~Right away.~
@48049 = ~Slash slash jab, slash parry. How am I doing?~
@48050 = ~Decent, if unenthusiastic.~
@48051 = ~You're supposed to pretend it's alive, not pretend you're stabbing a corpse.~
@48052 = ~You'll be dead in the first charge with that lackluster attitude.~
@48053 = ~How am I doing, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?~
@48054 = ~You're not here to impress me, you're here to survive and protect the land. Let's spar so you can practice on a skilled opponent.~
@48055 = ~Let's spar. It should be interesting to practice with another half-elf.~
@48056 = ~Corwin, any thoughts?~
@48057 = ~What do you think, Jaheira?~
@48058 = ~You need more attention, more energy. You're fighting for your life as well as Daggerford.~
@48059 = ~Your low energy might work to your advantage. Stare intently at your enemies while attacking. You might confuse them and break their morale.~
@48060 = ~Thank you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@48061 = ~That helped, thank you. There aren't many of our kind here. It's hard to feel part of the team when I'm so obviously different.~
@48062 = ~Everyone has something that makes them different. Think instead on what you have in common: a desire to protect the land.~
@48063 = ~It's hard to feel part of the team when I'm so obviously different.~
@48064 = ~Everyone has something that makes them different. Think instead on what you have in common; a desire to protect the land. ~
@48065 = ~You're right. We all care about our duty. I'll try to be more a part of the team from now on.~
@48066 = ~Yes. When I first joined the militia, I was the only half-elf in my unit. I already felt "between races," so being the only half-elf made me feel more alienated.~
@48067 = ~I admit I've felt somewhat alienated. It's hard to feel part of the team when I'm so obviously different.~
@48068 = ~What helped me was remembering that we were all there for the same reason: to serve the land and protect its people.~
@48069 = ~I have never been a soldier, but I know what it is to be different. I was raised by druids, not by my parents, and often felt alone.~
@48070 = ~I admit I've felt somewhat alienated. It's hard to feel part of the team when I'm so obviously different.~
@48071 = ~Everyone has a reason to feel alone. We each make our own paths and fight for our own causes. You must find the strength within to endure, as do we all.~
@48072 = ~That's... unusual advice. I'll think about what you've said.~
@48073 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@48074 = ~Let's get to it! Ready to go, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! ~
@48075 = ~That's the attitude I like to see, soldier. Show that recruit over there what you've got.~
@48076 = ~You got it! For Daggerford! ~
@48077 = ~Two stabs in the thighs, one in the stomach, and wait for him to fall! How was that, <PRO_SIRMAAM>? ~
@48078 = ~Not bad, but you're striking heavily armored areas. Aim for the joints. You'll conserve energy and do more damage.~
@48079 = ~You're doing the same thing I did when I first learned to fight. Going for the areas you can reach. Let me show you a different method.~
@48080 = ~What do you think, M'Khiin?~
@48081 = ~Glint, it looks like there's something on your mind.~
@48082 = ~You'll wear yourself out hitting those armor plates over and over. Look for injured enemies to finish off, or challenge combatants of your size.~
@48083 = ~You need to find a way to make your height work for you. Aim for ankles and knees. Bring them down to your level.~
@48084 = ~Don't try to fight like a big one. Hitting up wears you out.~ [BD48084]
@48085 = ~I do tire pretty quickly during drills. I thought I just needed more training.~
@48086 = ~Learn to fight right today. Less to unlearn later.~ [BD48086]
@48087 = ~That makes a lot of sense. I'll start practicing right away!~
@48088 = ~I do get fatigued pretty quickly during drills. I thought I needed more training.~
@48089 = ~Striking upward wears you out and doesn't do much damage. Try to hit between the joints of armor, or look for lightly armored opponents. ~
@48090 = ~Sure, I can try that. I'll get to practicing, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@48091 = ~You want to stab at the enemy's torso. A natural instinct, I understand it—but it's not as effective as it could be, and I'm guessing it's hard on the arms, right?~ [BD48091]
@48092 = ~It's natural to stab at the enemy's torso, but it's hard on the arms and not very effective.~
@48093 = ~I do get fatigued pretty quickly during drills. I thought I needed more training.~
@48094 = ~Nah. Fight smarter, not harder. I say aim for the kneecaps.~ [BD48094]
@48095 = ~I think I'm getting the hang of this! ~
@48096 = ~Finished training those recruits yet? ~
@48097 = ~I'll do my best to whip them into shape.~
@48098 = ~I've finished training the recruits.~
@48099 = ~Then get to it! ~
@48100 = ~Let's see how you did.~
@48101 = ~Incredible! I didn't think it was possible to whip that ragtag unit into shape, but you've done it.~ [BD48101]
@48102 = ~It took some time and patience, but I'm happy with the result.~
@48103 = ~I did, didn't I?~
@48104 = ~It wasn't easy. I deserve compensation.~
@48105 = ~These louts might actually have my back in battle thanks to you. Here, take this. I don't need it, and you might.~ [BD48105]
@48106 = ~Thank you.~
@48107 = ~Magic items are handy things to have. Thanks.~
@48108 = ~This should suffice.~
@48109 = ~If you ever need anything from me or these soldiers, just ask.~
@48110 = ~They're better than they were, I'll give you that. Not amazing, but better.~ [BD48110]
@48111 = ~It took some time and patience to get them even to this level.~
@48112 = ~There's limits to what even I can do in a few hours.~
@48113 = ~It was no easy task. ~
@48114 = ~I appreciate you trying, anyway. Who knows, you might have saved a couple of their lives. Here, take this armor. It doesn't fit any of the recruits, and it might keep you alive.~ [BD48114]
@48115 = ~I appreciate it.~
@48116 = ~Given the level of incompetence I was dealing with, your soldiers might need it more than I do, ill-fitting or not—but I'll still take it. Thanks.~
@48117 = ~If this is the best you can give me, it'll have to do.~
@48118 = ~Dismissed.~
@48119 = ~What—? How is this even possible? I think—they might even be WORSE than when I left!~ [BD48119]
@48120 = ~I did the best I could with them.~
@48121 = ~I don't think you appreciate how hard I worked!~
@48122 = ~No one could help these incompetents.~
@48123 = ~You think this is a joke? You'd gamble with my and my soldiers' lives?~ [BD48123]
@48124 = ~That's for wasting my time! Soldiers, keep practicin'. I'll try to undo all the damage this twit has done to you!~ [BD48124]
@48125 = ~Gosh, I think you might have made her angry.~
@48126 = ~Ahh! I'm burning up!~
@48127 = ~The pain... I can't take it anymore!~
@48128 = ~If I die, tell my children I'll watch over them.~

@48133 = ~You can make time for the hero of Baldur's Gate, I'm sure.~
@48134 = ~Make time. You'll not like the alternative. What's your name?~
@48135 = ~Well, I'm not sure. Who are you? ~
@48136 = ~I'm <CHARNAME>. I'm looking for ways to help the coalition.~
@48137 = ~They call me the hero of Baldur's Gate. Maybe you've heard of me.~
@48138 = ~<CHARNAME>, and I don't have time to waste answering your questions.~
@48139 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate? It's an honor. I've heard many stories about you.~
@48140 = ~Who are you, exactly?~
@48141 = ~What's going on here?~
@48142 = ~Is there anything I can do to help?~
@48143 = ~I am Theodosia Immartyred, but call me Dosia—everyone else does. I'm a cleric of Ilmater with the unenviable task of running this triage camp.~
@48144 = ~Ilmater, you say?~
@48145 = ~Why do we need a triage camp? The fighting hasn't started yet.~
@48146 = ~Is there anything I can do to help?~
@48147 = ~A sickness has broken out in camp and several soldiers have fallen ill. We keep healing the soldiers and they keep getting worse. ~
@48148 = ~How can I be of service?~
@48149 = ~I'm no expert but maybe if they keep getting worse it means you're not really healing them.~
@48150 = ~Why should I care?~
@48151 = ~A deity of suffering and penance—some call him the Crying God. I took my vows as a young girl to serve him all my life.~
@48152 = ~What needs to be done here?~
@48153 = ~How wonderful for you. What exactly is going on here?~
@48154 = ~Your faith doesn't interest me as much as what happened to these people.~
@48155 = ~The illness is complicated and resists all our efforts to understand it. If we can't find a cure for these people, it could compromise our entire force.~
@48156 = ~Have you any knowledge of healing? Or companions that might? Examine our patients. Perhaps you'll discover something I cannot.~
@48157 = ~I'll look at the patients and return to you shortly.~
@48158 = ~I'll look at them—from a distance. I don't want to get sick.~
@48159 = ~If I do, I'll expect to be rewarded for it.~
@48160 = ~I can ask nothing more. Come back once you've taken a look at the afllicted.~

@48162 = ~Ugggh... so hot. Feel like I'm in the Calim Desert... ~
@48163 = ~Keep still. I'm here to help. I'm just going to take a look at you, all right?~
@48164 = ~Try to relax. Viconia here is going to take a look at you.~
@48165 = ~Glint here is going to try and help you with that.~

@48170 = ~How do we do that? ~
@48171 = ~The man is burning up. Ordinary methods will do little against a fever this strong. I know of a salve I can make that might reduce the heat.~ [BD48171]
@48172 = ~Good job, Viconia. ~
@48173 = ~Whoa! The man's hotter than a fire mephit's libido! We need to bring the heat down. I know a couple herbs that will do the trick. I'll get started on a poultice right away.~ [BD48173]
@48174 = ~What should we do? ~

@48199 = ~What do you suggest? ~
@48200 = ~Let's see here, shall we? Pain and tenderness, yes, yes. Calm down, my good sir, calm down! You need to conserve your energy. You... aah! Get back; he's got a weapon!~ [BD48200]

@48205 = ~Any idea what's wrong? ~
@48206 = ~He seems on the verge of snapping. I've seen forest rats turn like this, biting and clawing. Soldier? Stay calm. That's an order!~
@48207 = ~Forest rats do this too, when the pain is too much to bear. Look at his eyes! Minsc knows nothing of sickness, but he knows this man is ready to bash in a few heads! Watch out!~ [BD48207]
@48208 = ~Why do you think that? ~

@48229 = ~Why is she worse off than the others? ~
@48230 = ~She's lying in the center of the group, meaning she's more exposed to ill people than any of the others. My guess is her location is making her worse. ~
@48231 = ~Thanks, Glint. ~
@48232 = ~She is in poor condition, my friend. If we don't find a cure for this sickness, she will be the first to die. Her position in the camp's center leaves her exposed to all her ill companions. I believe that proximity makes the illness worse.~

@48247 = ~What did you learn?~
@48248 = ~The afflicted are running high fevers, becoming violent, and becoming sicker when they are in close proximity to one another. Give them herbal salves to reduce their fever, bind them to their cots and move them farther apart.~

@48251 = ~Nothing you don't already know.~
@48252 = ~That will help a great deal. I'll make good use of this information immediately. Ilmater bless you for your aid.~
@48253 = ~The patients are becoming agitated, even violent. One attacked me. We should bind them to their cots.~
@48254 = ~Patients in close proximity to others are faring worse. We should space the cots more widely.~
@48255 = ~That's not enough? What more do you want from me?~
@48256 = ~A grim situation, that. We'll do as you say.~
@48257 = ~Also, the patients all have an unusually high fever. I believe that can be helped with an herbal poultice.~
@48258 = ~You should also space the cots more widely. Close proximity to others afflicted worsen the symptoms.~
@48259 = ~I would if I were you.~
@48260 = ~You have a healer's eye. We'll move the bedding further apart immediately. What else have you learned?~
@48261 = ~I learned that the patients all have an unusually high fever. We can bring the fever down with an herbal poultice.~
@48262 = ~The patients are becoming agitated, even violent. One attacked me. We should bind them to their cots.~
@48263 = ~Nothing you don't know already.~
@48264 = ~Do you have any ideas on where to go from here? ~
@48265 = ~The patients' symptoms resemble those of sickly rats. There are several rats around camp, so I'll try to catch one and see if I can learn anything from it.~
@48266 = ~The patients' symptoms resemble those of sickly rats from the Forest of Wyrms. I'll try to catch one and let Minsc take a look at it.~
@48267 = ~The symptoms are similar to those of sickly rats in the Forest of Wyrms. I'll try to catch one. Jaheira might be able to learn something from it.~
@48268 = ~The patients' symptoms resemble those of sickly rats from the Forest of Wyrms. I'll try to catch one and see if Corwin can learn anything from it.~
@48269 = ~I know something of the healing arts. I believe the blackthorn tree might have the qualities needed to concoct a cure. I'll seek one in the woods.~
@48270 = ~None. Viconia, have you any thoughts?~
@48271 = ~Glint? What do you think?~
@48272 = ~Jaheira? Do you think we can create a cure?~
@48273 = ~I was going to ask you the same, Dosia.~
@48274 = ~I think all we can do is let the illness ride its course. Keep the sick from the healthy, and hope for the best.~
@48275 = ~We can't risk infecting the entire camp. The most merciful thing to do is to execute these people and burn the bodies.~
@48276 = ~Boo will help translate his rat-cousins' speech!~ [BD48276]
@48277 = ~A solid place to start. A druid or ranger might be able to learn something from examining a rat. There are plenty around camp.~
@48278 = ~You want me to interview a rat? Very well, I'll help however I can.~
@48279 = ~The bark of the blackthorn tree might be used to brew a cure—if we can find one soon enough for it to make a difference.~ [BD48279]
@48280 = ~I once helped a town suffering a similar plight with a blackthorn bark brew. If we can find one in the forest, I might be able to do it again.~ [BD48280]
@48281 = ~The bark of the blackthorn tree that grows in these parts has many healing properties. I suggest we venture into the woods to find one.~
@48282 = ~The only idea I've got is a long shot. There's tell of a druid who lives in the woods, Onoroth. Supposedly he knows much of herbs, and healing in general. If we can find him, he might be able to help.~
@48283 = ~You think he might know a cure?~
@48284 = ~I've never found reclusive hermits to be that reliable a resource, as a matter of course.~
@48285 = ~The only idea I've got is a long shot. There's tell of a druid who lives in the woods, Onoroth. Supposedly he knows much of herbs, and healing in general. If we can find him, he might be able to help.~
@48286 = ~I'll start out at once.~
@48287 = ~Long shots sometimes pay off. I'll find the druid.~
@48288 = ~I'll find this hermit and force him to help us.~
@48289 = ~It's not much of a plan, but I've got nothing better. Please hurry. I fear we haven't much time left.~
@48290 = ~That's unacceptable. Maybe we can't help these people right now, but we shouldn't stop looking for a cure.~
@48291 = ~We won't. They yet live, and where there's life, there's hope. Do you have any ideas where I might start?~
@48292 = ~The fate of the Sword Coast hangs in the balance. We can't lose sight of that. Keep the sick away from the rest of camp and let the illness run its course.~
@48293 = ~The strong will survive. We're better off without the weak.~
@48294 = ~You might think that's best, but I'll continue seeking a cure. Now leave me.~
@48295 = ~At last, a sensible solution.~
@48296 = ~What?! No, no. Unacceptable. You can't be serious.~
@48297 = ~I don't like it, either. Let me think a moment...~
@48298 = ~The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, Dosia. We can't shy away from what must be done.~
@48299 = ~Do I look like I'm joking? Our enemies wouldn't hesitate to take such action, nor can we if we're to win this fight.~
@48300 = ~I thought you a hero. You're naught but a monster. If you'll not help here, begone. I've work to do.~
@48301 = ~No! No. I can't accept that.~
@48302 = ~I don't want to accept it either, but I see few other options.~
@48303 = ~Being a good leader means making difficult choices. We must do what's best for the camp.~
@48304 = ~Your moral code has no place here. We must do whatever it takes, make whatever sacrifices are necessary, to achieve victory.~
@48305 = ~I'll pass what you've said on to the General. But I don't like it.~
@48306 = ~Ilmater's blessing be upon you. Fare thee well.~
@48307 = ~Squeak!~
@48308 = ~Hello, little rat. I'd like to talk to you about an illness in our camp.~
@48309 = ~Uh, hi, rat. This might seem weird, but I wonder if you would talk to my friend here?~
@48310 = ~I can't understand you. I'd better come back with a ranger or druid who can translate for me.~
@48311 = ~SQUEEEAK!~
@48312 = ~Hsss! Leave 'em alone! They be my pack!~
@48313 = ~I don't want to interfere with your pack. I just need some information.~
@48314 = ~Where did YOU come from?~
@48315 = ~A wererat! Kill it!~
@48316 = ~This be my territory afore you moved in! Hsss! Leave my pack and go! ~
@48317 = ~I only need to speak to one rat. Then I'll be on my way.~
@48318 = ~Well, it's our territory now. And as ridiculous as it sounds, I need to talk to a rat. ~
@48319 = ~Crossing me is a mistake you don't want to make, you malodorous brute. I've slain far worse than you in my time.~
@48320 = ~My nest! My pack! Die! ~
@48321 = ~Hello, little rat. I'd like to talk to you about an illness in our camp.~
@48322 = ~Uh, hi, rat. This might seem weird, but I wonder if you would talk to my friend here?~
@48323 = ~I can't understand you. I'd better come back with a ranger or druid who can translate for me.~
@48324 = ~Squeakum squeak. ~
@48325 = ~Some of our people are sick. They get a bad fever and then they get violent before they die. I know this happens to your kind too. ~
@48326 = ~Squeak squeakin'. ~
@48327 = ~You roll in the bark of the blackthorn tree when you get ill? ~
@48328 = ~Squeak! Squeak.~

@48330 = ~Squeak. ~
@48331 = ~Corwin, can you talk to the rat?~
@48332 = ~Jaheira, can you talk to the rat?~
@48333 = ~Minsc, can you talk to the rat?~
@48334 = ~I never imagined that talking with rats would be a critical part of my role in the war. Good think I didn't go into fortunetelling as a career.~
@48335 = ~I'm describing the illness to the rat and asking about its pack's experience...~
@48336 = ~Squeak squeakin'.~
@48337 = ~It says when its kind gets sick, they roll in the moldy bark of the blackthorn tree.~
@48338 = ~Can we find those in the forest outside the camp? ~
@48339 = ~Yes, we can! If we can find some of this moldy bark, maybe we can cure the soldiers.~
@48340 = ~I shall do what I can. I have seen rats with symptoms like those afflicted in camp before—I'm asking the creature what it does when its pack falls ill.~
@48341 = ~I have seen rats with these symptoms before. I'm asking the creature what it does when its pack falls ill.~
@48342 = ~Squeak squeakin'.~
@48343 = ~In the forest grows a tree we call the blackthorn tree. Old trees collapse and grow mold on their bark—the rats roll in it to relieve the sickness. We must find a tree and collect all the mold we can—but leave some for the rats.~
@48344 = ~Do the rats eat the mold to get better? ~
@48345 = ~No, they roll in it. We must venture into the woods. Once we find a tree, we should collect all the mold we can. But leave some for the rats.~
@48346 = ~Nay, but Boo can! Speak to your cousins, Boo! Tell them of the sickly soldiers and ask if they know what to do.~ [BD48346]
@48347 = ~Of course he can. ~
@48348 = ~Speak to your cousins, Boo! Tell them of the sickly soldiers and ask if they know what to do.~
@48349 = ~Squeak squeakin'.~
@48350 = ~Boo tells me of a tree in the woods around camp. It grows black thorns on its bark and mold grows on the fallen trunks.~ [BD48350]
@48351 = ~When the forest rats sicken, Boo says they roll around in this mold. We must find the tree and its soggy bark to heal the sick ones!~ [BD48351]
@48352 = ~What do you want? Get out of here! ~
@48353 = ~I'm looking for a druid who knows about healing. Several soldiers are ill. Their sickness threatens our whole camp.~
@48354 = ~I've returned with the basilisk claw.~
@48355 = ~Forgive me. I didn't mean to disturb you.~
@48356 = ~Which is it? Tell you what I want or get out of here?~
@48357 = ~Don't threaten me, old man.~
@48358 = ~Go! Now! ~
@48359 = ~You said sickness. Sickness is why you're here? ~
@48360 = ~Yes. Several of our people have developed fever and pain. Some have grown violent.~
@48361 = ~Actually, I need to return later.~
@48362 = ~The forest gives everything, yes. The forest is all. ~
@48363 = ~Do you mean there's a healing plant in the forest?~
@48364 = ~Does it give gold? If so, point me toward the gold tree right away.~
@48365 = ~I've no time for riddles.~
@48366 = ~The forest gives everything, yes. It was mother and father to me, providing all I needed. I used to roam it freely, but now... now I am old, and move so slowly...~
@48367 = ~I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help you?~
@48368 = ~You seem pretty spry to me. Why don't you tell me what you know about this illness and I'll leave you to your frolicking?~
@48369 = ~And your point is...?~
@48370 = ~Knowledge... my knowledge is precious. Years of living alone, studying, meditating. Why should I share what I have learned with you?~
@48371 = ~I'm <CHARNAME>. Some call me hero. I'm just trying to do some good in this world. I believe you have information that can save lives.~
@48372 = ~If you don't help me, we might lose the fight to the crusade. Zealot hordes will overrun your forest. Do you want that?~
@48373 = ~Let me answer your question with a question: Why should I not slay you where you stand?~
@48374 = ~Good and evil mean nothing to me—but you are determined, I can see. Determination is often needed to bring balance to the world.~
@48375 = ~You argue well. The forest doesn't care about war, but I care about the forest.~
@48376 = ~Someday my bones will sink into the soil and I will repay the forest that gave me so much. But that day has not come yet.~
@48377 = ~I don't trust you, outsider. You come to my forest asking so much, so I will ask something of YOU.~
@48378 = ~Fair enough. What do you want of me?~
@48379 = ~Well, there's a shocking plot twist. All right, let's hear it. What do you need?~
@48380 = ~Tell me what you want, then, but do it quickly. My patience is wearing thin.~
@48381 = ~A basilisk living to the northwest has been driven mad by disease. Slay the beast—give her peace. Then bring me her claw.~
@48382 = ~I'll return when I have her claw.~
@48383 = ~Bloodthirsty basilisk? I can manage that. I'll be back within the hour.~
@48384 = ~It will be done—but the knowledge I receive had better be worth the effort.~
@48385 = ~You are a true friend to the forest. I will help you.~
@48386 = ~Take this healing draught I brewed from the moldy bark of the blackthorn tree. It will cure your sick. Now go. I need stillness again, and the peace of the woods.~

@48394 = ~I've found something I believe will help cure the patients. It's this blackthorn bark.~
@48395 = ~I might have found a cure in this blackthorn bark. Acquiring it was a lot of trouble and effort. How much will you give me for it?~
@48396 = ~Not yet. I'll return as soon as I have something for you.~
@48397 = ~Compensation? I don't understand. ~
@48398 = ~It's simple. I went to a lot of trouble and effort to acquire this cure. What will you pay me for it?~
@48399 = ~Gold, magic items, I don't care as long as you give me something for the cure.~
@48400 = ~I was just teasing you. Here, take the cure.~
@48401 = ~There are few things more distasteful than extorting the sick.~ [BD48401]

@48403 = ~You demand payment for saving lives? What kind of hero are you?~
@48404 = ~A practical one. I only want to be paid fairly for my efforts.~
@48405 = ~I never claimed to be a hero. If you want the cure, pay me. If not, I'll smash it on the ground.~
@48406 = ~A poor one indeed, if I let the sick die. Here, take the cure.~
@48407 = ~I serve Ilmater, not Waukeen. I have a few healing potions I could give you, although our soldiers need them more.~
@48408 = ~It will do. Hand them over.~
@48409 = ~Not good enough. I'll hold on to the cure until I find a better offer.~
@48410 = ~I'll not see allies deprived on my account. Here, take the cure.~

@48413 = ~Thank Ilmater! Your reputation is well earned, and I'll tell anyone who asks that you're a true hero. I'll administer the cure immediately. Here, take this with my thanks. It's the least I can do.~

I met a druid who warned me away from a cavern. He seems to be the leader of this region and allows only certain people to pass.~

@48437 = ~<CHARNAME>. Under normal circumstances, I would never say this, but... I could use some help.~ [BD48437]
@48438 = ~What's wrong, Safana?~
@48439 = ~Coming from you, that is rather an astonishing admission. ~
@48440 = ~Why should I care?~
@48441 = ~It's wit like that that makes me SO happy to travel with you.~ [BD48441]
@48442 = ~Now and then I like to test my reflexes by, ah, let's call it rearranging things in other people's pockets when they're not paying attention.~
@48443 = ~That is a problem. With some time and effort you should be able to break yourself of the habit, though.~
@48444 = ~Right. A reflex test. Go on.~
@48445 = ~Get to the point.~
@48446 = ~A most dishonorable pastime.~
@48447 = ~I agree completely! Later you should show me your technique, Safana, so I can be properly disgusted.~
@48448 = ~No, THAT'S not my problem. Will you just listen?~
@48449 = ~In the last couple of days, I, ah, dipped my fingers into a few pockets. One held a bag of junk and this notebook. It contains details of the camp defenses, commander names, and bits of conversation.~ [BD48449]
@48450 = ~Those sound like the notes a spy would make.~
@48451 = ~It looks like a seal of some kind...?~
@48452 = ~What is it?~
@48453 = ~It's a crusader seal, but that's not all it is.~
@48454 = ~That mark on the front is Caelar's personal emblem. Only a crusader would carry something like this—an important one, I'd wager. We have a spy in our midst.~
@48455 = ~Who did you take this from?~
@48456 = ~Well, don't make me wait for the big reveal. Who's the traitor?~
@48457 = ~We should go to the commanders with this.~
@48458 = ~Only a spy would make these kind of notes. We have a traitor in our midst.~ [BD48458]
@48459 = ~Who did you take the notebook from?~
@48460 = ~Mm-hmmm... And the traitor is...?~
@48461 = ~The commanders need to know about this.~
@48462 = ~That's the problem. While I was working, I wasn't paying attention to faces. It could have come from a few different people.~ [BD48462]
@48463 = ~What were the other items in the bag?~
@48464 = ~Do you remember any of the people you robbed?~
@48465 = ~We need to inform the commanders.~
@48466 = ~And get me locked up in stocks for a week? I DON'T think so.~ [BD48466]
@48467 = ~All right, let's move on. What were the other items in the bag?~
@48468 = ~Curses, you've uncovered my devious plan.~
@48469 = ~All right, let's move on. What were the other items in the bag?~
@48470 = ~Forget I said anything. Do you remember any of the people you robbed?~
@48471 = ~I know it is. That's why I came to you. Let's stop wasting time and find the traitor. ~
@48472 = ~What were the other items in the bag?~
@48473 = ~Do you remember any of the people you robbed?~
@48474 = ~Keep making jokes. It's not like a traitor could be undermining this entire effort even as we speak. Oh, wait, it's exactly like that.~ [BD48474]
@48475 = ~Point made. What else was in the bag with the notebook?~
@48476 = ~Do you remember any of the people you robbed?~
@48477 = ~There was the notebook, of course. A potion, a candle, and this sheet of paper covered in runes of some sort.~ [BD48477]
@48478 = ~What kind of potion?~
@48479 = ~Describe this candle for me.~
@48480 = ~Runes?~
@48481 = ~Do you remember any of the people you robbed?~
@48482 = ~That's all the information I need. Wait here, I'll ask around and try to figure out the traitor's identity.~
@48483 = ~Do I look like an alchemist to you? It might be a healing potion, but it's in a weird bottle. Maybe the traitor purchased it in camp.~ [BD48483]
@48484 = ~Tell me again what was in the bag.~
@48485 = ~Do you remember any of the people you robbed?~
@48486 = ~Very well. Join me, and let's see if we can find this spy of yours.~
@48487 = ~It's not your average tallow stick. Gold leaf is pressed into the side, and it's quite heavy.~ [BD48487]
@48488 = ~Anything else special about it?~
@48489 = ~Glint, does this mean anything to you?~
@48490 = ~Viconia, do you know anything about this?~
@48491 = ~Let me take a look at that... Ah, yes, I recognize this. These candles are used during prayers by priests of Tempus.~ [BD48491]
@48492 = ~Actually, I've seen this exact candle before! A soldier named Col tried to sell it to me. He seemed to think I was some sort of thief, if you could believe that!~ [BD48492]
@48493 = ~I recognize the markings on that candle. Priests of Tempus use them during their rituals.~
@48494 = ~There's nothing else special about it. Maybe a priest could tell us more.~ [BD48494]
@48495 = ~Tell me what was in the bag again.~
@48496 = ~Do you remember anything about the people you robbed? Anything at all?~
@48497 = ~That's all the information I need. Wait here, I'll ask around and try to figure out the traitor's identity.~
@48498 = ~It looks like the page was torn out of a book. I can make NO sense of the runes.~ [BD48498]
@48499 = ~No sign of the book it might have come from, though?~
@48500 = ~Those look like military code to me. Maybe one of the higher-ranking officers in camp knows something about it.~
@48501 = ~Looks like gibberish to me. You know nothing else about this page?~
@48502 = ~I c-can't be sure, but this look like military code to me. The page might be from a cipherbook used to translate mil-military intelligence messages.~
@48503 = ~All I know is it came from someone's pocket.~ [BD48503]
@48504 = ~Run through what was in the bag again, Safana.~
@48505 = ~Can you tell me nothing of the people you robbed, Safana?~
@48506 = ~That's all the information I need. Wait here, I'll ask around and try to figure out the traitor's identity.~
@48507 = ~"Robbed" is such a loaded term. I prefer to think of it as easing friends' physical burden. As to the question, they were all soldiers. I think.~ [BD48507]
@48508 = ~So we need to find a soldier in an armed encampment. That narrows things down. Join me, and let's see if we can find this spy of yours.~
@48509 = ~What exactly was in the bag?~
@48510 = ~That's all the information I need. Wait here, I'll ask around and try to figure out the traitor's identity.~
@48511 = ~Hey, I'm doing the best I can! ~
@48512 = ~Sorry. I know you are. What were the other items in the bag?~
@48513 = ~Your best better be enough to catch this traitor before people die. What were the other items in the bag?~
@48514 = ~Let's get going. We can ask around and try to figure out the traitor's identity.~
@48515 = ~Don't let me down.~ [BD48515]
@48516 = ~There's a lot of work goes in to preparing a camp this size. You'll have to be quick about whatever you want. ~
@48517 = ~Sorry to bother you, but I have a question about a potion bottle.~
@48518 = ~Yeah, well there's a lot of work goes in to being a hero of my stature. Take a minute of your day to help me with this incredibly important bottle.~
@48519 = ~I need you to help me identify this bottle.~
@48520 = ~Bottle? Bottle? I'm trying to coordinate supplies for hundreds of troops and you want to ask me about a bottle? Seriously?~
@48521 = ~Finding this bottle's owner could have a significant impact on our forces. If you would see Caelar defeated, you need to help me now.~
@48522 = ~This bottle may lead me to a powerful spell we can use to decimate our enemies. I need to know more about it.~
@48523 = ~This will take but a moment. Can you tell me anything about this bottle? Finding its owner could have a significant impact on our effort against the crusade.~
@48524 = ~I'm not asking for your firstborn child. I just need you to take a look at this bottle.~
@48525 = ~Stop shouting and help me. Have you seen this bottle before?~
@48526 = ~Don't you take that tone with me. The Council thinks you're important, but I think you're bad luck. I've heard the whispers, I know what they say about you...~
@48527 = ~I've done much work on the coalition's behalf. I helped Dosia heal sick soldiers—does that count for nothing?~
@48528 = ~Help me with this bottle or I'll show you how bad your luck can get.~
@48529 = ~I'm not going to threaten you, Belegarm—I'll just speak earnestly and from the heart. I'm trying to do right by everyone in this camp. And I wouldn't waste your time if I didn't sincerely believe you could help me do that.~
@48530 = ~Isn't there anything I can do to change your mind?~
@48531 = ~No. Now I'm going back to work.~
@48532 = ~Fine. If it's that important, let me look at this incredibly important bottle...~
@48533 = ~Dosia did say something about that, now that I think of it. All right, I can spare a minute. Let me see the bottle.~
@48534 = ~I recognize the shape. Helvdar the dwarf—he guards the camp's northern barricade—he keeps all his potions in weird bottles like this.~
@48535 = ~Thank you. I appreciate your help.~
@48536 = ~There, was that so hard?~
@48537 = ~If you'd just said that at the beginning, we wouldn't have had to waste so much time.~
@48538 = ~Now if you'll excuse me, I really must get back to work.~
@48539 = ~If you can't be civil, don't say anything at all. Now I must get back to work.~
@48540 = ~I knew you were the violent type. Darkness seethes in your eyes. No, I won't be helping you. Be on your way.~
@48541 = ~Halt! Who goes there? ~
@48542 = ~It's just me, <CHARNAME>.~
@48543 = ~Aren't you supposed to say that to people OUTSIDE the barricade?~
@48544 = ~Watch your tone. I go where I please.~
@48545 = ~Sorry, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Things went a bit late last night. I'm not quite at my best just yet, hehe.~
@48546 = ~Is this your potion bottle?~
@48547 = ~This isn't a game, soldier. You need to be in top form when you're on duty.~
@48548 = ~Carry on, then.~
@48549 = ~A s-soldier so unconcerned about his duty that he spends all night drinking. Shameful.~
@48550 = ~Come now, mine friend. You can hardly fault a man for enjoying what might be the last night of his life.~ [BD48550]
@48551 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@48552 = ~My bottle? Where did you find it?~ [BD48552]
@48553 = ~Why, did you lose it?~
@48554 = ~That's not important. Where did you leave it?~
@48555 = ~Among ample evidence that you're a traitor. Make peace with whatever god you worship—you're about to meet them.~
@48556 = ~A traitor? No! I lost that bottle in a card game last night.~ [BD48556]
@48557 = ~Who was at this card game?~
@48558 = ~Lost it to whom?~
@48559 = ~You expect me to believe that? Die, dwarf!~
@48560 = ~I lost it playin' cards last night. How did you get it?~ [BD48560]
@48561 = ~Never mind that. Who was at this card game?~
@48562 = ~Who won the bottle?~
@48563 = ~A likely story. Die, dwarf!~
@48564 = ~It was me and a couple of soldiers, fellas named Col and Rendahl.~ [BD48564]
@48565 = ~And who won the bottle?~
@48566 = ~Thanks for your help, soldier.~
@48567 = ~Can't say. It's bad luck to talk about your losses, and I've another game tonight!~ [BD48567]
@48568 = ~It's important that I learn who won that bottle. Can't you help out a fellow dwarf?~
@48569 = ~I'd be happy to cast a good-luck charm on you in exchange for the information.~
@48570 = ~Would 20 pieces of gold help you feel luckier?~
@48571 = ~I really need to know who won that bottle. ~
@48572 = ~You'll have worse luck still if you don't tell me who won the bottle.~
@48573 = ~I suppose tellin' can't do any real harm. It was Col who won the bottle.~ [BD48573]
@48574 = ~So Col is the man I'm looking for. Thanks, soldier. You've been most helpful.~
@48575 = ~A good luck charm, huh? I could sure use it. All right. It was Col who won my potion.~ [BD48575]
@48576 = ~The spell is cast. You'll now be very lucky at all you try. ~
@48577 = ~Sorry, I can't help you.~ [BD48577]
@48578 = ~Help! Murder!~ [BD48578]
@48579 = ~Good luck on your mission! But don't take any o' my luck. Hehe!~ [BD48579]
@48580 = ~Good day, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~ [BD48580]
@48581 = ~My eyes are bleeding watching you try to keep formation! You're the clumsiest bunch of privates to ever TRY to march in an army! ~
@48582 = ~Sorry to bother you, Vigilant. Is this piece of paper yours?~
@48583 = ~They're terrible all right. Say, did you drop this piece of paper?~
@48584 = ~Leave off training for a moment and help me. Does this paper belong to you?~
@48585 = ~Sorry, but I've got a lot of work to do with this group. Page doesn't look familiar. Get it together, troops!~
@48586 = ~Let me take a look... No, this isn't mine. Looks like it could be a page from the cipher book of Warden Twoedged. Have you asked her?~ [BD48586]
@48587 = ~Who's Warden Twoedged?~
@48588 = ~No, I haven't. Where can I find her?~
@48589 = ~I'll do that, thank you.~
@48590 = ~She's a retired Warden of Waterdeep who's helping to coordinate the siege. You can usually find her in the commander's tent. Excuse me now—duty calls.~
@48591 = ~Thank you, sergeant. ~
@48592 = ~Get it together, troops! ~
@48593 = ~Did you need something, young one?~ [BD48593]
@48594 = ~Can you tell me if this paper belongs to you?~
@48595 = ~Not as young as I look, ma'am.~
@48596 = ~What is it you're doing here? If you don't mind my asking.~
@48597 = ~Thank you, no.~
@48598 = ~Ah yes. It's hard to tell with elves. ~
@48599 = ~Does this paper belong to you?~
@48600 = ~Can I ask what you're doing here?~
@48601 = ~I need to be going.~
@48602 = ~Helping design tactical movements and troop deployments. I've been retired for years but my mind's still sharp. ~
@48603 = ~Does this paper belong to you?~
@48604 = ~I need to be going.~
@48605 = ~How...? Where did you get this? Answer me.~ [BD48605]
@48606 = ~I can't tell you. I just need to know if you gave it to anyone else or if someone took it from you.~
@48607 = ~Why, what is it?~
@48608 = ~I'll ask the questions, traitor.~
@48609 = ~Traitor—? Guards! Guards, to me!~
@48610 = ~This page was found among the possessions of a spy. How do you explain that?~
@48611 = ~I dare because it's true. And the punishment traitors face is death.~
@48612 = ~You go too far! Guards!~
@48613 = ~That is from a code book used to translate military ciphers. You shouldn't be seeing it. Return it at once.~ [BD48613]
@48614 = ~I've helped several of the officers in camp. I even trained Vigilant Halasan's troops. You can trust me.~
@48615 = ~I know the importance of keeping tactics secure. I swear on my own weapon I want only to find the person who had this page.~
@48616 = ~On my honor as a knight I swear you can trust me. Please believe me when I say it's imperative that I track down whoever had that page.~
@48617 = ~There must be some way I can change your mind.~
@48618 = ~Trying to deflect this issue back on me will avail you naught, traitor.~
@48619 = ~I assure you there is not. Good day.~
@48620 = ~Very well. I will believe you. Do not make me regret it. I loaned that book to one of Nederlok's lieutenants. A man named Malden Col.~ [BD48620]
@48621 = ~I leant that book to one of Nederlok's lieutenants, a man named Rendahl.~
@48622 = ~Thank you. You've been very helpful. ~
@48623 = ~Tread carefully. We live in dangerous times. ~
@48624 = ~I have work to do. Excuse me.~
@48625 = ~The Lord of Battles will see us to victory!~
@48626 = ~The glory of Tempus shall lend us strength!~
@48627 = ~If I find that thief, he'll feel Tempus's wrath!~
@48628 = ~I am Mizhena, faithful of Tempus. Praise be to the Lord of Battles!~ [BD48628]
@48629 = ~Excuse me. Is this your candle?~
@48630 = ~Tell me more about the Lord of Battles.~
@48631 = ~Praise him, praise him! Have you any healing or potions for sale?~
@48632 = ~Battles are for fighting, not worshiping. I'm off to find one.~
@48633 = ~Tempus, the lord of strength at arms and military might, will lead us to victory!~
@48634 = ~I'm sure he will. Do you have any healing or potions I could purchase?~
@48635 = ~I don't carry items for sale. You might want to talk to Quartermaster Belegarm if you need supplies. ~
@48636 = ~Thank you. I need to go. ~
@48637 = ~My candle! So YOU'RE the thief. ~
@48638 = ~I am a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of faith, even as you are. I know the violence Tempus's faithful are capable of. Don't make me show you what I am willing to do.~
@48639 = ~No! I... well, it's complicated. But I didn't steal it.~
@48640 = ~No. I'm trying to find the thief.~
@48641 = ~Call me a thief again and I'll cut out your tongue.~
@48642 = ~Threaten me again and I'll bloody your nose! ~
@48643 = ~I don't want to fight you. I'm trying to find the person who stole your candle.~
@48644 = ~Bloody my nose and I'll blacken both your eyes.~
@48645 = ~Blacken my eyes and I'll break both your arms! ~
@48646 = ~Why are we threatening each other? We both want the same thing—to find out who stole your candle. This is madness.~
@48647 = ~Break my arms and I'll headbutt your face into crimson paste!~
@48648 = ~Ha ha! You're a fierce warrior, no doubt, and Tempus is the god of warriors. I believe you—you'd not stoop to theft.~ [BD48648]
@48649 = ~Any idea who did?~
@48650 = ~My threats made you trust me? Okay I'll go with that. Do you know who stole your candle?~
@48651 = ~My warnings were in earnest. Now, do you know who took your candle?~
@48652 = ~She is a priest of Tempus, god of battles. She has little use for reason. You'll win her respect through violence.~ [BD48652]
@48653 = ~Somehow you expect me to believe you, yet you do nothing but dance with your words. You sound like a merchant.~
@48654 = ~Insult me again and I'll show you your own guts. I am a cleric, same as you—show some respect.~
@48655 = ~Look, I don't know exactly how I offended you, but whatever I did, I apologize. I'm just trying to determine who took this candle.~
@48656 = ~One word, one more word, and I swear I'll rip that venomous snake tongue from your mouth.~
@48657 = ~Begone! I'll not trade more words with a thief.~
@48658 = ~The other night, I saw Malden Col leaving my tent. I chased him, but he got away. I'm sure he took the candle, but I can prove nothing. I didn't report it. I planned to... "speak" to Col about it myself. With my fists.~ [BD48658]
@48659 = ~That is most helpful. You have my thanks.~
@48660 = ~Col, you say. I'll go ask him some questions.~
@48661 = ~I'll beat the truth out of him.~
@48662 = ~I'll take my candle back too!~
@48663 = ~Fight well, friend!~
@48664 = ~Something I can help you with? ~
@48665 = ~I've some questions for you about an item that was found yesterday.~
@48666 = ~Nothing right now, soldier.~
@48667 = ~For the Flaming Fist!~
@48668 = ~I'm not sure I understand.~
@48669 = ~This seal was found among a number of items, including a potion you won playing cards last night.~
@48670 = ~This seal was found along with a page of military codes. You borrowed a book of such codes from General Twoedged, did you not?~
@48671 = ~This candle was stolen by Malden Col. He was at your card game last night. Did you win it from him?~
@48672 = ~Forgive me, I misspoke. Luck to you.~
@48673 = ~All you can prove is that I won something in a poker game. That doesn't mean anything. ~
@48674 = ~All of these items came from the same person. That means you're a traitor, Rendahl. ~
@48675 = ~And if I did? I borrowed a book. That proves nothing.~
@48676 = ~All of these items came from the same person. You're a traitor, Rendahl.~
@48677 = ~You're more trouble than we anticipated, "hero"—but you're still doomed. Caelar will triumph!~
@48678 = ~There <PRO_HESHE> is! Attack!~
@48679 = ~For Caelar! For the crusade!~
@48680 = ~Keep your distance, friend. I don't want you catching what I've got.~
@48681 = ~I want you to listen to what Dosia has to say.~
@48682 = ~I've returned with a means to heal you.~
@48683 = ~I can heal you, soldier.~
@48684 = ~Would you like this healing potion?~
@48685 = ~My companion, Viconia, can heal you.~
@48686 = ~My companion, Jaheira, can heal you.~
@48687 = ~My companion, Glint, can heal you.~
@48688 = ~I'll keep my distance, then.~
@48689 = ~*cough* Be well, stranger.~
@48690 = ~Am I to be offered out as a healing service, then?~ [BD48690]
@48691 = ~If you think it's best, I will heal the man.~
@48692 = ~The grace of the Sly One does allow me to heal the injured. ~
@48693 = ~No, no! *cough* No healing. I am made to suffer.~
@48694 = ~Made to suffer? What do you mean?~
@48695 = ~That's a stupid... I mean interesting... point of view.~
@48696 = ~I won't waste healing on one who doesn't want it.~
@48697 = ~No! No—*cough*—no healing. I am made to suffer. My pain brings me closer to the Crying God.~
@48698 = ~You're talking about Ilmater?~
@48699 = ~The Crying God?~
@48700 = ~You don't want to be healed?~
@48701 = ~I won't waste healing on one who doesn't want it.~
@48702 = ~He speaks of Ilmater, god of suffering.~ [BD48702]
@48703 = ~Ilmater. Deity of endurance, suffering... Not the most upbeat god one might worship. His followers tend towards the fanatical—as you can see.~
@48704 = ~Ilmater. The Broken God. The Lord on the Rack. The One Who Endures. Every wracking cough brings me closer to my faith.~
@48705 = ~You really don't want to be healed because it makes you feel pious?~
@48706 = ~I won't waste healing on one who doesn't want it.~
@48707 = ~The Crying God is Ilmater, god of suffering and endurance. Every wracking cough brings me closer to my faith. ~
@48708 = ~You really don't want to be healed because it makes you feel pious?~
@48709 = ~I won't waste healing on one who doesn't want it.~
@48710 = ~You wouldn't understand. Only the faithful can comprehend Ilmater's wisdom and the purity that comes with perseverance.~
@48711 = ~I do understand. Suffering scours the soul, bringing what's truly important into focus.~
@48712 = ~Having studied Ilmater's teachings, I believe I do understand. Ilmater's faithful are to bear what hardships they can, to find strength within.~

@48714 = ~Glint? Do you know what he's talking about?~
@48715 = ~Ilmater needs faith—we need fighters. If you don't let me heal you, I'll give you suffering beyond your wildest imagining.~
@48716 = ~We need every soldier we can get. If you don't let me heal you, I'll give you more suffering than you know what to do with.~
@48717 = ~I understand we'll need every fighter we can get to defeat Caelar. You must let me heal you.~
@48718 = ~I won't waste healing on one who doesn't want it.~
@48719 = ~You know the Crying God's teachings. Then you understand why I refuse healing.~
@48720 = ~Ilmater teaches us to persevere, but also offers comfort to those in pain. We will need your strength to defeat the Shining Lady. Allow me to heal you.~
@48721 = ~I believe Ilmater permits one to take on the suffering of another. If I injure myself, will you let me heal you?~
@48722 = ~We need every soldier we can get. If you don't let me heal you, I'll give you more suffering than you know what to do with.~

@48724 = ~I won't waste healing on one who doesn't want it.~
@48725 = ~You've convinced me, stranger. I must think of the greater good instead of my personal faith. You may heal me. ~
@48726 = ~Let me cast this healing spell, then.~
@48727 = ~Here, take this healing potion.~
@48728 = ~Viconia, heal the man.~
@48729 = ~Jaheira, do what you can to alleviate this man's suffering.~
@48730 = ~Glint, do that thing you do.~
@48731 = ~I'll return with a means to heal you, then.~
@48732 = ~V-very well. You've convinced me to think of the greater good instead of my personal faith. ~
@48733 = ~No true follower of Ilmater would deny another the opportunity to suffer. I accept the bargain. ~
@48734 = ~I am ready. ~
@48735 = ~Ilmater's followers embrace pain and loss—they believe suffering is a means to a greater end. Those who worship Shar know the truth: There is nothing noble in suffering needlessly. This man should accept healing and use his strength in service to his fellow fighters.~ [BD48735]
@48736 = ~But Ilmater also offers a balm to pain, which Shar never does. This man should accept our healing and add his strength to the camp.~
@48737 = ~Sort of...? I think? Ilmater worship is utterly bizarre to me. I've heard tell that Ilmater allows others to take the burden of suffering. This is a little odd, but stick with me here—perhaps you could injure yourself in exchange for healing the man?~
@48738 = ~I have heard, though, that Ilmater allows others to take on the burden of suffering. Perhaps you could injure yourself in exchange for healing the man?~
@48739 = ~No. I'm made to suffer for Ilmater's glory. You won't sway me from my faith.~
@48740 = ~Very well. I'll return later if I think of a way to change your mind.~
@48741 = ~We need all the soldiers we can get. I'm healing you whether you like it or not.~
@48742 = ~No! ~
@48743 = ~Healing me against my own wishes—! You have committed a grievous sin this <DAYNIGHTALL>. I'll not forgive this blasphemy. When I'm finished, everyone in this camp will know of your contempt for people of faith.~
@48744 = ~I feel much better! Oh, what have I done? I allowed myself to accept healing and a release from pain.~
@48745 = ~I feel—better... No, no—what have I done? Forgive me, Ilmater; your servant has failed you! But you, <CHARNAME>, you did help me. Take these as thanks. I'll keep the whip, though. After this, I've much to atone for.~
@48746 = ~You go ahead and do that, then.~
@48747 = ~Whatever you need to do. Just keep the details to yourself.~
@48748 = ~Any god that believes good health is something for followers to atone for is not worthy of such devotion. It's your choice, of course, but you're making a foolish one.~

@48751 = ~I know you and throw myself at your feet, holy one!~

@48757 = ~I want to talk to you about Hyreth. He's obviously ill, but he won't let me heal him because of his faith. ~
@48758 = ~Oh yes, Hyreth is very devoted, although he's not a priest like me. ~
@48759 = ~Would you talk to him? I think with your influence he'd allow me to help him. ~
@48760 = ~What about it? ~
@48761 = ~Well, I was hoping you'd talk to him. I think with your influence he'd allow me to help him. ~
@48762 = ~I've enough troubles of my own without taking yours on as well. Now leave.~
@48763 = ~Hyreth's faith is very strong. It's not my place to contradict the teachings of Ilmater.~
@48764 = ~His faith puts this entire effort at risk. We'll need every fighter we've got if we're to take Dragonspear.~
@48765 = ~If that's the way you feel, I understand.~
@48766 = ~Ridiculous. You can't let such idiocy cost the coalition valuable soldiers.~
@48767 = ~I see your point. Go talk to Hyreth again and I'll come and support you.~
@48768 = ~Thank you. Now I must return to work.~
@48769 = ~Such "idiocy" grants me the power to heal ANY soldier. If you would fight the Shining Lady without battlefield healing, you should feel free to do so. Now excuse me, I've patients that need attention.~

@48773 = ~Word to the wise, friend. There are eyes upon you. We'll expect preliminary payment in the next tenday. 5,000 gold pieces. Don't be short.~
@48774 = ~What do you mean? Who are you?~
@48775 = ~Preliminary payment for what?~
@48776 = ~You'll be short a head if you try to take my gold. What's this all about?~
@48777 = ~You know. Your reputation preceeds you, after all. ~
@48778 = ~What reputation?~
@48779 = ~Speak plainly. Who do you represent?~
@48780 = ~Anyone who tries to take my money is going to suffer for it.~
@48781 = ~Ask your friend Safana. She know how this works.~
@48782 = ~Safana, what's going on here?~
@48783 = ~What reputation?~
@48784 = ~Speak plainly. Who do you represent?~
@48785 = ~If you think I'll hand my gold over willingly, you're the one who needs to learn how things work.~
@48786 = ~Someone's trying to organize a thieves' guild.~
@48787 = ~You mean thieves. ~
@48788 = ~The first payment expected is 5,000 gold pieces. Don't be short. ~
@48789 = ~Wait, I have questions.~
@48790 = ~Tell your masters they're not getting a single copper piece from me.~
@48791 = ~If I ever see you again, you're dead.~
@48792 = ~5,000 gold. We'll be in touch.~
@48793 = ~Greetings, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. In the market for a new weapon? Or perhaps a potion? ~
@48794 = ~Let me see what you have.~
@48795 = ~I'm in the market for something out of the ordinary.~
@48796 = ~I heard you were a fence for the thieves' guild here.~
@48797 = ~Have you heard about the sickness going around camp? I have a cure for it and I'm looking for a buyer.~
@48798 = ~I think you'll be happy with my selection.~
@48799 = ~What did you have in mind?~
@48800 = ~Let's just say I have something unique I picked up on my travels. Something a powerful individual would be interested in. Know anyone like that?~
@48801 = ~Nothing, I misspoke. Can you show me your regular goods?~
@48802 = ~I should be able to set something up. Come to the camp's northern edge. I'll have someone there to meet with you.~
@48803 = ~I'm afraid you've been misinformed, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@48804 = ~Excellent. I'll be there.~
@48805 = ~I don't think so, and that's a good thing. I have no intention of shutting you down. In fact, I'd like to meet a representative for the thieves' guild in camp. Can you arrange it?~
@48806 = ~I've no patience for your games. I need to meet with someone from the thieves' guild. Set it up, or things will get very unpleasant for you.~
@48807 = ~I can tell you've never been properly cursed before. I promise that will change if you don't arrange a meeting 'twixt me and a thieves' guild representative. Don't try me on this, woman.~
@48808 = ~You're sorely mistaken. I'm not a thief and I'll thank you not to insult me anymore. Good day.~
@48809 = ~As if a paladin would want to meet with thieves! You're trying to trick me somehow and I'm not falling for it. Good day.~
@48810 = ~All right, all right. Come to the north edge of camp when it's dark. I'll have someone ready to meet you.~
@48811 = ~I'll be there. ~
@48812 = ~I'll take my chances. Now get gone.~
@48813 = ~Actually, I did hear the crusaders have been stricken with illness. They're offering 250 gold for a cure.~
@48814 = ~A good price. I accept.~
@48815 = ~I think someone else might pay more for it. No deal.~
@48816 = ~As you like. Luck to you.~
@48817 = ~You've made a good bargain today.~
@48818 = ~Luck to you.~
@48819 = ~What you see is what I've got.~
@48820 = ~Let me see your regular wares, then.~
@48821 = ~I heard you carried more exotic items. Things procured via, shall we say, less than ethical means.~
@48822 = ~You killed them. Both of them. ~
@48823 = ~They left me little choice.~
@48824 = ~It happens. Frequently.~
@48825 = ~If you'd not join them, start talking. Now.~
@48826 = ~I like the way you think, friend. The cadre will too. Come to the camp's north edge after dark. I'll have someone ready to meet you.~
@48827 = ~I'll be there. ~
@48828 = ~Good day to you. ~
@48829 = ~You wanted to meet with me. Here I am. ~
@48830 = ~I heard you're setting up a thieves' guild in camp. I'm here to stop you.~
@48831 = ~I hear there's an association of independent business people forming in camp. I want to join.~
@48832 = ~I know you're part of this would-be thieves' guild trying to make a profit off a war. Disband at once or pay the price.~
@48833 = ~When Waizahb told me the hero of Baldur's Gate wanted to meet, I knew our days were numbered. I don't want a massacre, so I'll tell you what—we'll rein in our activities from now on.~
@48834 = ~See you when the arrows start flying.~
@48835 = ~You've got adamantine nerves, I'll give you that much. I could have a dozen hidden thieves with poisoned crossbows just waiting in the shadows.~
@48836 = ~You'd better use those thieves to our benefit. I'm the hero of Baldur's Gate, and you know I could have your operation and you executed in a heartbeat. No more thieving, and when the time for war comes, I'd better see you on the front lines.~
@48837 = ~Yeah, I've faced hordes of bow-wielding enemies before. Guess where they are? Taking a dirt nap, while I'm here staring you down.~
@48838 = ~I'll kill every one of your minions, but not until I kill you!~
@48839 = ~And I thought I was cutthroat. Fine, our loot is hidden in under some fallen rocks, in the forest near that underground cavern. The rocks are directly east of the cave entrance where all the crusaders are camped out.~
@48840 = ~Much appreciated. Now be on your way.~
@48841 = ~I would have been much better at organizing your guild, just so you know. Scram.~
@48842 = ~Thank you for the information. I'll make good use of it after you're dead.~
@48843 = ~All right, all right! I thought we'd kept our activities quiet, but not quiet enough, it seems. I'll have my people come to the coalition's side when the battle breaks. Good enough?~
@48844 = ~You won't take me down!~
@48845 = ~No more! I surrender! ~
@48846 = ~Why should I spare your life?~
@48847 = ~Tell me who's organized all the thieves in camp.~
@48848 = ~Too little, too late. Die!~
@48849 = ~No! ~
@48850 = ~They forced me to join! I didn't want to! I can tell you who's in charge—please, don't kill me!~
@48851 = ~Tell me what I would know and I promise you will live.~
@48852 = ~Your life is in your own hands now. Tell me what I want to know and you might walk away from this. Or limp away from it, at least.~
@48853 = ~I make no promises. Give me the name or your death is assured.~
@48854 = ~I will, but you have to promise not to kill me! ~
@48855 = ~I promise to let you live.~
@48856 = ~If your information is good, I'll probably let you live.~
@48857 = ~I make no promises. Tell me or die for certain.~
@48858 = ~It's one of de Lancie's men, Gramorn! He's been secretly gathering all the thieves under his command.~
@48859 = ~Why is he doing this?~
@48860 = ~Why? What's Gramorn's plan?~
@48861 = ~Where can I find Gramorn?~
@48862 = ~Now to deal with you.~
@48863 = ~I don't know for sure. I'm new and he hasn't told me anything. ~
@48864 = ~He's taking fifty percent of what he expects thieves in camp to make, whether they actually steal that much or not. And he's collecting secrets.~
@48865 = ~He's usually with the troops from Waterdeep. De Lancie could catch him easily, I bet. ~
@48866 = ~Wh-what are you going to do to me? ~
@48867 = ~Execute you, for your crimes against this camp and my own person.~
@48868 = ~I should cut you down where you stand, but I'll not waste the energy. The guards can have you.~
@48869 = ~But you promised to let me live! ~
@48870 = ~I lied.~
@48871 = ~All right. The guards can have you. Other matters need my attention now, anyway.~
@48872 = ~Thank you. Thank you! ~
@48873 = ~What do you want? ~
@48874 = ~You are Gramorn, are you not? I've heard you're behind the camp's burgeoning thieves' guild.~
@48875 = ~That depends entirely on who you are.~
@48876 = ~I'd like more information on the camp, if you're of a mind to give it.~
@48877 = ~Nothing right now.~
@48878 = ~Aumarr Reinss Gramorn, of Waterdeep. I answer to Torsin de Lancie. ~
@48879 = ~I've heard that you're the man behind the thieves' guild in camp.~
@48880 = ~Aumarr? Torsin?~
@48881 = ~Tell me what's going on with the camp, Aumarr.~
@48882 = ~I need to be going.~
@48883 = ~Titles for the city guard of Waterdeep. You can think of de Lancie as a colonel and me as a captain. ~
@48884 = ~Is it true you're behind the thieves' guild in camp? I heard someone say that.~
@48885 = ~A captain, eh? Can you tell me how our effort against Caelar is progressing?~
@48886 = ~Interesting. I think I'll be moving along now.~
@48887 = ~Detachments from Waterdeep's city guard, the Flaming Fist, and Daggerford's militia have laid a perimeter around Dragonspear Castle. We're in decent shape, especially now that reinforcements from Baldur's Gate have arrived.~
@48888 = ~I've heard you're behind the camp's thieves' guild.~
@48889 = ~Remind me again who you are...?~
@48890 = ~Good to know. I'll leave you to your duties.~
@48891 = ~On your way, then.~
@48892 = ~You've heard wrong.~
@48893 = ~I don't think so. Cut me in on your take or I'll go straight to de Lancie with what I know.~
@48894 = ~I know the truth. Surrender, now.~
@48895 = ~Ah. Forgive me, then. I'll leave you to your duties.~
@48896 = ~Well, well. You're an opportunistic little rodent, aren't you? How much do you want?~
@48897 = ~500 gold will do to start.~
@48898 = ~1,000 gold and not a copper less.~
@48899 = ~This farce is at an end, Gramorn. Surrender.~
@48900 = ~I'll pay you, because you're more valuable to me alive than dead. Someone with your qualities will make a good addition to the team.~
@48901 = ~I'm not part of your team.~
@48902 = ~I might be interested in working with you.~
@48903 = ~You presume too much, Gramorn. I work alone.~
@48904 = ~We'll see. Luck to you.~
@48905 = ~You had a chance, <CHARNAME>, but then you got greedy. I'll take my chances with de Lancie.~
@48906 = ~Drop your weapons, then.~
@48907 = ~You'll take your chances with me, dead man.~
@48908 = ~Or what? You'll kill me?~
@48909 = ~I'm an aumarr in the Waterdeep City Guard. You even look at me sideways and every Waterdhavian soldier in this camp will be upon you. ~
@48910 = ~I'll explain after you're dead.~
@48911 = ~I might not be able to take you out now, but watch yourself. I know where you sleep.~
@48912 = ~You'll be on the ground in a pool of blood before you can shout a single word. Face it. You can't touch me here. ~
@48913 = ~I might not be able to take you out now, but watch yourself. I know where you sleep. ~
@48914 = ~You've ruined my plans! Now die! ~
@48915 = ~Time to pay up. 5,000 gold. Hand it over.~
@48916 = ~What am I supposed to be paying for, exactly?~
@48917 = ~Here's an idea: Why don't I not give you 5,000 gold pieces, and you run away from here as fast as your legs can carry you?~
@48918 = ~Come and take it, if you think you're able.~
@48919 = ~It's the price of doing business in camp. Are you going to pay up or is this going to get ugly?~
@48920 = ~I don't plan on doing any "business" in camp. I'm not interested in joining your guild.~
@48921 = ~How about you hand over YOUR money?~
@48922 = ~If I had a hundred times that much gold, I still wouldn't give you a single coin.~
@48923 = ~It may surprise you to learn that I don't care. If you won't give me the gold, I guess I'll just have to take it.~
@48924 = ~How about I break your legs and then just take the cadre's due? Yeah, let's try that instead.~
@48925 = ~If you won't give me the payment, I'll just have to take it.~
@48926 = ~You have been chosen not because you are the strongest or the wisest.~ [BD48926]
@48927 = ~You have been chosen because you have heart and the faith to see the crusade to its end!~ [BD48927]
@48928 = ~You will storm the gates of the Nine Hells!~ [BD48928]
@48929 = ~You will slay the devils within and claim their realm for good!~ [BD48929]
@48930 = ~You may be frightened, but you will cast aside all doubt!~ [BD48930]
@48931 = ~You are MEANT to be here! You will do great deeds here, because YOU are Caelar's chosen!~ [BD48931]
@48932 = ~Hello, recruit. You must be new. ~
@48933 = ~Yes, I just joined a short time ago.~
@48934 = ~What gave me away?~
@48935 = ~I may be new, but I'm not inexperienced in the ways of war.~
@48936 = ~I don't recognize your face, recruit. Are you new? There are so many newcomers to the cause these days I can't keep track of them all. That's a good thing.~ [BD48936]
@48937 = ~I can see that. Well, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.~
@48938 = ~I'm Deneld, the morale officer of this camp. What's your name?~ [BD48938]
@48939 = ~I'm <CHARNAME>.~
@48940 = ~You can call me Ensler.~
@48941 = ~I left my old name behind when I joined the crusade.~
@48942 = ~Hst! Perhaps you should be more cautious with your name.~
@48943 = ~<CHARNAME>, is it? I've heard that name before...~ [BD48943]
@48944 = ~I get that a lot. I share the name of a famous general or something.~
@48945 = ~I'm also known as the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@48946 = ~We've never met.~
@48947 = ~Well, never mind that. Let me ask you about the crusade. What do you know about our mission here?~ [BD48947]
@48948 = ~It has something to do with marching into the Nine Hells and killing fiends, doesn't it?~
@48949 = ~I know we follow the Shining Lady Caelar. She guides us in whatever we do.~
@48950 = ~It let me escape from my old life. That's all I need to know.~
@48951 = ~Excellent. Sacrificing a name is a small but moving tribute to Caelar's grace. Would that more recruits displayed such devotion to the Lady.~ [BD48951]
@48952 = ~It has something to do with marching into the Nine Hells and killing fiends, doesn't it?~
@48953 = ~I know we follow Caelar, the Shining Lady. She guides whatever we do.~
@48954 = ~All I know is it let me escape from my old life.~
@48955 = ~Wait... it's—it's you. It's YOU. INTRUDER!~ [BD48955]
@48956 = ~What a coincidence, there's another Sallo here who joined us some time ago. You even look like you could be twins!~
@48957 = ~Of course, you can always find THAT Sallo passed out behind the wine casks. Such a shame. I hope you're not like that.~
@48958 = ~I can honestly say the other Sallo and I are two different people.~
@48959 = ~I prefer to pass out behind the ale kegs.~
@48960 = ~We're opposite as night and day.~
@48961 = ~Well met, Ensler. Let me ask you something. What do you know about our mission here?~ [BD48961]
@48962 = ~It has something to do with marching into the Nine Hells and killing fiends, doesn't it?~
@48963 = ~I know we follow the Shining Lady Caelar. She guides us in whatever we do.~
@48964 = ~It let me escape from my old life. That's all I need to know.~
@48965 = ~Well, that's a start. There's a great deal more you can learn about the crusade, though. Why don't you speak to some of the other crusaders in camp?~ [BD48965]
@48966 = ~Speaking to the c-crusaders isn't a bad idea. We m-might gain some insight into our enemies' minds.~
@48967 = ~The stammering lackwit is right, for once. What you understand you can more easily destroy.~
@48968 = ~After you've talked to some of the others, return here and demonstrate your new knowledge. I'll present you with a token signifying your understanding of our glorious cause. Sound good? Of course it does! See you soon.~ [BD48968]
@48969 = ~I'll speak to some of the other crusaders, then.~
@48970 = ~Sure, I'll see if anyone here has anything interesting to say.~
@48971 = ~I might, if I decide I can spare the time.~
@48972 = ~For the glory of the crusade, recruit. ~
@48973 = ~Ah, the new recruit returns. Have you spoken to your fellow crusaders and learned of our cause?~ [BD48973]
@48974 = ~I have, yes.~
@48975 = ~I think there is still more I might learn.~
@48976 = ~Learn from others' tales, then, and return to me when you are ready to review what you've discovered.~ [BD48976]
@48977 = ~In that case, let the testing begin.~ [BD48977]
@48978 = ~The sooner this pointless exercise is over with, the better.~ [BD48978]
@48979 = ~Answer me this: Why? Why does the crusade exist?~ [BD48979]
@48980 = ~Devils are evil creatures, monstrous jailers of mortal souls. The crusade will rid existence of their wickedness and free all the trapped souls of the Hells.~
@48981 = ~Crusades rise to remedy injustices that cannot be addressed by other means. Caelar seeks to repair the damage the Hells have wreaked upon this land.~
@48982 = ~A crusade's nature is to set right a terrible wrong. The Shining Lady seeks nothing less than freedom for the innocent souls trapped in the Nine Hells.~
@48983 = ~The Shining Lady called to us. We answered.~
@48984 = ~No one had anything better to do, I imagine.~
@48985 = ~To fight fiends and find glory in battle!~
@48986 = ~That is true... but it's not the answer I sought. You still have much to learn.~ [BD48986]
@48987 = ~I'll do better next time.~
@48988 = ~What are you talking about? There's nothing wrong with my answer.~
@48989 = ~This interrogation grows tiresome.~
@48990 = ~You're not the first to hide fear and uncertainty behind weak humor. Talk to more of your fellow toilers in light—see if you can find reassurance in what they tell you.~ [BD48990]
@48991 = ~Excellent. A perfect answer to my question.~ [BD48991]
@48992 = ~A unique interpretation of the crusade, one which shows a deep understanding of the Shining Lady's cause.~ [BD48992]
@48993 = ~My next question is this: How will the crusade achieve victory?~ [BD48993]
@48994 = ~Faith ensures the crusade's ultimate success. Our personal faith strengthens us; Caelar's faith will protect us when we descend into the Nine Hells.~
@48995 = ~Caelar raises her followers' spirits and gives them hope where before there was nothing but hopelessness. In doing so, she makes the weakest of her crusaders strong, ensuring success.~
@48996 = ~Logic says we would be destroyed the moment we breach the Nine Hells. Caelar is a holy warrior. Her faith is our shield against the inferno.~
@48997 = ~Strength of numbers will bring us victory.~
@48998 = ~To be honest, I think we'll probably fail.~
@48999 = ~If we believe hard enough, we can do anything.~
@49000 = ~You have learned Caelar's lessons well, my friend. I'm impressed.~ [BD49000]
@49001 = ~Not the answer I expected, but I can't fault your thinking.~ [BD49001]
@49002 = ~Now for the final question. What is the heart of the crusade?~ [BD49002]
@49003 = ~Caelar Argent is the crusade's heart and soul. Her faith and purity inspire all who follow her. Without the Shining Lady, the crusade would crumble.~
@49004 = ~A powerful leader's importance to a movement such as ours can't be understated. Without a strong commander at its head, an army falls apart. Caelar is the heart of the crusade—I can see no other answer to the question.~
@49005 = ~We may have different reasons for being here, but all crusaders are united by the Shining Lady. She is what draws us together.~
@49006 = ~The desire to do good in this world.~
@49007 = ~Is it stupidity? I'm going to go with stupidity.~
@49008 = ~Righteousness born of virtue.~
@49009 = ~Wonderful. That's precisely the right answer.~
@49010 = ~You show impressive insight into the light that guides us.~ [BD49010]
@49011 = ~Well done! You truly understand the many and varied facets of our movement. I applaud you.~ [BD49011]
@49012 = ~It was a pleasure to learn about our glorious crusade.~
@49013 = ~And I get a reward now, right? I distinctly remember you mentioning a reward.~
@49014 = ~If there's nothing more, I must move on.~
@49015 = ~You don't need to lay it on quite so thick, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD49015]
@49016 = ~Accept from me this ring to mark your commitment to our cause. It will help protect you in battle. Now go forth, and bring Caelar's glory to this world!~ [BD49016]
@49017 = ~Though your answer was technically accurate, it lacks the depth I'm looking for here. You can do better.~ [BD49017]
@49018 = ~I'll try.~
@49019 = ~Why do YOU get to say what the truth is about the crusade? My answer's as good as any you could give.~
@49020 = ~If I've the time—and the inclination—I may return.~
@49021 = ~Careful, hero. You want to answer questions, not raise them.~ [BD49021]
@49022 = ~You question my worth? I'm one of Caelar's most trusted lieutenants. Surely you learned of me when you joined the crusade.~ [BD49022]
@49023 = ~Of course. I just—got a little worked up. I care about the crusade so much. It's embarrassing to be told my view of it is wrong.~
@49024 = ~All I've learned is you're an overbearing blowhard who holds himself in far too high a regard. No wonder the crusade is such a mess.~
@49025 = ~I misspoke. My apologies.~
@49026 = ~I understand. Calm yourself. Continue speaking to the other crusaders. In time, you will learn what you need to know.~ [BD49026]
@49027 = ~Your words reveal your true intentions. Crusaders! To me! THE ENEMY IS AMONG US!~ [BD49027]
@49028 = ~You lookin' at me? ~
@49029 = ~I am.~
@49030 = ~Not at all.~
@49031 = ~You have a problem with that, orc?~
@49032 = ~Stop it. I don't like bein' looked at. ~
@49033 = ~Why did you join the crusade, then? I imagine there are many people looking at you here.~
@49034 = ~Pray forgive me. I'll leave you alone.~
@49035 = ~You think I care what you like, you wretched monster?~
@49036 = ~Good. I don't like bein' looked at. ~
@49037 = ~Y'don't watch your mouth, you're gonna care. ~
@49038 = ~Explain this to me, please. Why did you join the crusade if you want to be left alone?~
@49039 = ~I've better things to do with my time than waste it on the likes of you.~
@49040 = ~Come on then. Make me care.~
@49041 = ~Crush your skull and gnaw on your bones!~
@49042 = ~Yeah. 'Swhat I thought.~
@49043 = ~Ravoc's fought devils before. Wants a chance to gnaw on their bones.~
@49044 = ~That's all? You're just looking for a good fight?~
@49045 = ~What a deep and nuanced motivation. I need some time to digest all that information.~
@49046 = ~So a monster wants the chance to kill other monsters?~
@49047 = ~A monster walks beside you, <CHARNAME>. Consider your words, lest you say something I'll have to make you regret.~
@49048 = ~Packs of fiends stalked the mountains not long ago. Portal opened in Ravoc's camp once. Red-winged killers spilled out. Tore our strongest apart without half thinking about it.~
@49049 = ~That must have been terrifying.~
@49050 = ~So that's where you got your first taste for devil flesh?~
@49051 = ~A battle between orcs and devils must have been a bloody affair.~
@49052 = ~I weren't scared! Watch your tongue or I'll spit it on m' dagger. ~
@49053 = ~I only meant the battle must have been a vicious one.~
@49054 = ~How can I watch my tongue? It's inside my mouth.~
@49055 = ~Calm down, brute, and finish your story.~
@49056 = ~Ravoc'll help you with that if y'don't watch out.~
@49057 = ~Took all our warriors to take out three devils. Their bones'r like steel and they tore our strongest in half without half thinking about it.~
@49058 = ~A score of us were lost taking down just three of 'em. Shaman said our dead didn't get to Gruumsh's realm. Their souls're trapped in the Hells below.~
@49059 = ~That's why you joined the crusade? Vengeance against the fiends?~
@49060 = ~Even an orc doesn't deserve that fate.~
@49061 = ~Get to the point.~
@49062 = ~When Ravoc sees the Shining Lady's light, he knows time has come to free his brothers.~
@49063 = ~Thank you for telling me your story, Ravoc.~
@49064 = ~That's... actually a pretty good reason to join the crusade. ~
@49065 = ~Should we ever reach the Hells, you wouldn't last two minutes.~
@49066 = ~Get outta here now. Don't like you lookin' at me.~
@49067 = ~Ravoc'll kill every fiend he sees! Get outta my way.~
@49068 = ~Watch his claw! Do you want to be disembowelled? ~
@49069 = ~Are you a troll handler?~
@49070 = ~I have some questions for you.~
@49071 = ~You seem busy. I'll come back later.~
@49072 = ~No time to talk. We have to get this troll under control!~
@49073 = ~Is that a drow accompanying you?~
@49074 = ~Who, Baeloth? He's a friend of mine.~
@49075 = ~You mean Viconia? Don't worry, she's trustworthy.~
@49076 = ~A drow! Where?~
@49077 = ~Beware, I behold the brand of Shevarash upon this beauty's amulet. She serves the sentinel of elven settlements, the slaughterer of drow.~
@49078 = ~We need to leave, now. This woman wears a holy symbol of Shevarash, hunter of drow.~
@49079 = ~If these drow are friends of yours, you are no friend of mine. I know the crusade attracts all types, but I'll never speak to a drow. Goodbye.~
@49080 = ~Right there! Get it!~
@49081 = ~I'm assisting the troll handlers. I'm a priest and able to heal anyone who takes a claw to the face. Usually.~
@49082 = ~Is that why you joined the crusade? To heal people?~
@49083 = ~Seems like a dangerous job. I'll leave you to it.~
@49084 = ~I have some questions for you.~
@49085 = ~You could say that. Are you familiar with Shevarash?~ [BD49085]
@49086 = ~He's an elven god of revenge, is he not? His faithful often hunt drow.~
@49087 = ~I've heard the name. He's some sort of vengeance god...?~
@49088 = ~Of course. The Black Archer guides his faithful toward just vengeance.~
@49089 = ~No, I'm afraid I'm not.~
@49090 = ~Of course. Good ol' Shevarash. ~
@49091 = ~Why should I care about your faith?~
@49092 = ~Many servants of Shevarash focus on our enemy, the drow, but he is also the god of crusades. I thought by coming here I might learn tactics I could take back home, while doing some good.~ [BD49092]
@49093 = ~So you consider this a holy calling?~
@49094 = ~I hate to tell you this but there probably won't be many drow in the Nine Hells.~
@49095 = ~Slaughtering your enemies is truly a righteous calling.~
@49096 = ~Indeed it is. I can understand the draw of a crusade that promises vengeance to one's enemies.~
@49097 = ~I thought I could learn tactics from the crusade that I could bring back to my settlement, all the while doing some good.~
@49098 = ~Instead, I gained a new appreciation of the power of faith. Caelar is so pure, so driven. She has accessed power that will protect us in the Nine Hells themselves.~ [BD49098]
@49099 = ~That's incredible.~
@49100 = ~Caelar's something, all right.~
@49101 = ~So she says. I have my doubts.~
@49102 = ~ 'Tis a wondrous thing to experience the power of true faith. I felt it when I dedicated myself to the Sly One. Perhaps you'd like to hear about his teachings?~ [BD49102]
@49103 = ~I hope I can achieve Caelar's level of devotion someday, and harness it as she has to protect my people from the Underdark.~ [BD49103]
@49104 = ~If Caelar truly can shield us from the Hells' fury, I'm sure you can manage the same against the Underdark.~
@49105 = ~Good luck with that.~
@49106 = ~A noble aim.~
@49107 = ~I need to get back to work now. Have a good day. ~
@49108 = ~Sorry, did you say something? ~
@49109 = ~"Hello."~
@49110 = ~You seem a little distracted.~
@49111 = ~Pay more attention. If we were attacked right now, you'd be caught completely off guard.~
@49112 = ~I'm sorry, I was thinking about... well, it's nothing. I should get back to work. ~
@49113 = ~I'd like to know what you were thinking about.~
@49114 = ~Goodbye, then.~
@49115 = ~Yes, you should.~
@49116 = ~May the Shining Lady's light guide you always.~
@49117 = ~Don't misunderstand me, but... I was thinking about Caelar.~
@49118 = ~That's understandable. She is our leader.~
@49119 = ~She's an attractive woman.~
@49120 = ~You should be thinking more about battle.~
@49121 = ~Soldiers m-must stay focused, even during between c-combats.~
@49122 = ~Not everyone can spend every waking moment thinking about battles. Some of us have more varied tastes.~ [BD49122]
@49123 = ~No! That's not what I mean at all.~
@49124 = ~I know, I know. She's so mesmerizing, though.~
@49125 = ~When Caelar spoke in my village, every word she said seemed to sear itself on my heart. It was like I was listening to a herald of utter truth.~
@49126 = ~When Caelar spoke in my village, every word she said seemed to—to sear itself on my heart. It was like I was listening to a herald of utter truth. Following her was an easy decision—it was OBVIOUSLY the thing to do.~
@49127 = ~She is a gifted orator, to be sure.~
@49128 = ~And now? Do you still believe the things she says?~
@49129 = ~Natural leaders always attract natural followers.~
@49130 = ~Caelar could never lie, I'm sure of it.~
@49131 = ~She shines like the morning star. Had anyone else come to my town, I'd not have joined the crusade. But I'll follow the Shining Lady anywhere.~
@49132 = ~I understand. Thanks for talking to me.~
@49133 = ~That's creepy. You know that, right? Creepy.~
@49134 = ~Into the Nine Hells itself, it seems.~
@49135 = ~Sorry, I didn't catch that. My mind was elsewhere. It's time for a drill now, but I can speak with you later. ~
@49136 = ~Watch out!~
@49137 = ~Watch the claws, watch the claws!~
@49138 = ~Shoot her! SHOOT HER!~
@49139 = ~Keep back! Everyone keep back!~
@49140 = ~Be careful!~
@49141 = ~Watch his claw! Do you want to be disemboweled?~ [BD49141]
@49142 = ~Are you a troll handler?~
@49143 = ~I have some questions for you.~
@49144 = ~You seem busy. I'll come back later.~
@49145 = ~Get out of here! I need to get this troll under control and you aren't helping!~
@49146 = ~Is that a drow by your side?~
@49147 = ~Who, Baeloth? He's a friend of mine.~
@49148 = ~You mean Viconia? Don't worry, she's trustworthy.~
@49149 = ~A drow! Where?~
@49150 = ~Beware, I behold Shevarash's brand upon this beauty's amulet. She serves the sentinel of elven settlements, the slaughterer of drow.~ [BD49150]
@49151 = ~We need to leave, now. This woman wears a holy symbol of Shevarash, hunter of drow.~ [BD49151]
@49152 = ~If you count a drow as a friend of yours, you are no friend of mine. The crusade accepts all who swear loyalty to Caelar. I do not. Luck to you—if you continue throwing your lot in with this scum, you'll surely need it.~
@49153 = ~Right there! Get it!~
@49154 = ~No, but I assist them. I can heal anyone who takes a claw to the face. Usually.~
@49155 = ~Looks like you're having some trouble. Can I be of assistance?~
@49156 = ~Seems like a dangerous job. I'll leave you to it.~
@49157 = ~I have some questions for you.~
@49158 = ~Actually, yes. We can't find Gnarg, the regular troll keeper. He keeps troll shackles in a chest back in the camp. ...Go get them!~ [BD49158]
@49159 = ~Yes, ma'am.~
@49160 = ~How will I recognize the chest?~
@49161 = ~I have more important things to do.~
@49162 = ~Watch those claws, soldiers!~
@49163 = ~It's next to one of the black and white tents.~
@49164 = ~I'll bring them right back.~
@49165 = ~I have more important things to do.~
@49166 = ~Excuse me, RECRUIT, but I'm your superior and I'm giving you a direct order. Fetch those shackles or I'll see you wearing a pair of your own!~
@49167 = ~This monster isn't subduing itself, recruit! Do you have the shackles?~
@49168 = ~Yes, I have them right here.~
@49169 = ~I need a little more time.~
@49170 = ~Hurry up! We can't keep this troll at bay forever.~
@49171 = ~Good job—now get in there and slap those shackles on the beast!~
@49172 = ~I'm on it!~
@49173 = ~Uhhh... What?~
@49174 = ~The monster will submit—or die.~
@49175 = ~Why?~ [BD49175]
@49176 = ~That's the spirit. We'll be right here if you need help!~
@49177 = ~Show some backbone, <PRO_MANWOMAN>! Go in there and tame that monster!~
@49178 = ~I'll get right on that.~
@49179 = ~You want it tamed, go in there and do it yourself.~
@49180 = ~It will break, or die.~
@49181 = ~See this insignia? It means I outrank you—I give the orders here. Get in there, or by Shevarash, there will be consequences!~
@49182 = ~I may look like a simple recruit, but I'm actually on assignment from Caelar, canvassing the troops undercover, evaluating morale.~
@49183 = ~I'll give it a try.~
@49184 = ~Uh, have you actually seen that thing? I'm not going anywhere near it!~
@49185 = ~You're out of order, recruit! Insubordination must be dealt with firmly!~
@49186 = ~You're out of order, recruit. Lying and insubordination must be dealt with firmly!~
@49187 = ~You do look familiar. ~
@49188 = ~Take these shackles and put them on the troll. Now. That's an order.~
@49189 = ~I'll handle the troll, but you'd better be ready to back me up. And in future, mind your tone.~
@49190 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@49191 = ~As you order, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@49192 = ~Raaaargh! ~
@49193 = ~Uh... Well met, friend. What's your name?~
@49194 = ~Calm down there, Mister Troll. I'm not here to hurt you.~
@49195 = ~Troll! Lie down and hold your hands out. Do as I say!~
@49196 = ~RAAARGH! Trollop! ~
@49197 = ~There's no need for name-calling.~
@49198 = ~Trollop? You're a female?~
@49199 = ~Lie down and present your hands. Obey me, damn you!~
@49200 = ~Back, skinny bites! Back from Ulori! ~
@49201 = ~Ulori? That's you, that's your name?~
@49202 = ~There'll be no biting here today. Now lie down and be quiet.~
@49203 = ~Get down on the ground and hold out your hands. DO IT!~
@49204 = ~AAAUGH! Time to eat! YOU! ~
@49205 = ~Try it. I'll tear you apart and burn the pieces. Lie down and be still!~
@49206 = ~Time is but a construct. In one sense, you have already eaten me, and will consume me again. Using a more standard linear chronology, however, that hasn't happened yet. Nor will it any time soon, as you are about to lie down and be still.~
@49207 = ~You're clearly anxious, and understandably so. Let me sing you a song to soothe your nerves.~
@49208 = ~Take one more step toward me, troll, and you'll regret it.~
@49209 = ~This doesn't have to end in bloodshed. Do as I command and I won't hurt you.~
@49210 = ~Tasty elf! Soft outside with crunch inside! ~
@49211 = ~You strong! Me no bite! ~
@49212 = ~That's better. Hold still while I put these shackles on you. ~
@49213 = ~Huh? ~
@49214 = ~The "arrow of time" flies ever forward. Your capitulation is assured, as, in a very real sense, you have already surrendered to my will. You don't want to alter the timestream, do you?~
@49215 = ~N-no? ~
@49216 = ~That's right. Chronological disruption carries with it dire consequences. So lie down now, and I'll put these shackles on you.~
@49217 = ~Ulori like music. ~
@49218 = ~Then you'll love this. I call it, "Troll Lullaby." It goes like this: "Go to sleep, massive troll, and dream of your dinner..." ~
@49219 = ~Nice... music... zzzzz.~
@49220 = ~Yah, Ulori stay still.~
@49221 = ~Rip your flesh and chew on the bones!~
@49222 = ~You're back. ~
@49223 = ~I've come to claim my reward.~
@49224 = ~You look none the worse for wear.~
@49225 = ~I have a few questions.~
@49226 = ~Sorry, I have to track down Gnarg and finish a hundred other tasks. We'll have to talk later.~
@49227 = ~You did a good job, recruit. Here, these potions should serve as a token of my gratitude. You'll need them when we challenge the enemies gathering beyond the gates. They do devils' work. We'll have to put them down.~
@49228 = ~You're going to need them when we go up against that coalition building outside the gates. They've allied with devils and we'll have to put them down!~
@49229 = ~Well, I guess you did a good enough job. Of BOTCHING everything up COMPLETELY.~
@49230 = ~Damn it! You were to shackle the troll, not kill it! The Shining Lady could have used its strength and you just wasted it! Go, get out of my sight before I throw you in the stocks!~
@49231 = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, I was able to patch up the survivors. More or less. Now if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.~
@49232 = ~I changed my mind. I won't waste healing on one who doesn't want it.~
@49233 = ~Is there anything I can do to help?~
@49234 = ~I want to talk to you about Hyreth. He's obviously ill but won't let me heal him because of his faith.~
@49235 = ~We need to talk about Hyreth. He's obviously ill, but he won't let me heal him because of his faith.~
@49236 = ~You can make time to talk to the hero of Baldur's Gate, I'm sure.~
@49237 = ~Tell me who you are and what's going on. Now.~
@49238 = ~Is there anything I can do to help?~
@49239 = ~If you can't deal with Hyreth, you WILL deal with me. What's your name?~
@49240 = ~We have the vampire cornered. He's riddled the path with traps so we can't get to him, but by the same token, his only way out is through us. We expect him to appear any moment. You ready for a fight?~
@49241 = ~I'm ready.~
@49242 = ~Give me a few minutes to prepare.~
@49243 = ~Always, though I'm not sure this is one I care to get involved in.~
@49244 = ~Fight your own battles.~
@49245 = ~Don't take too long. The vampire could appear at any time. ~
@49246 = ~Look! There, in the trees!~
@49247 = ~Isabella? Our friend is still here...~ [BD49247]
@49248 = ~Oh, for the love of... here. Try to hold on to this one.~
@49249 = ~Are you sure you got them all? I don't want to risk walking into the one snare you missed. The vampire is harmless now; just go find the body and stake it.~
@49250 = ~Get going, then!~
@49251 = ~I lost the stake. Do you have another?~
@49252 = ~I disarmed the traps leading to the vampire's lair.~
@49253 = ~I'll return when the vampire is destroyed.~
@49254 = ~Isabella... my dear companion. I won't rest until I return you to life!~ [BD49254]
@49255 = ~What is it? What do you want?~
@49256 = ~I lost my stake. Do you have another?~
@49257 = ~I disarmed the traps leading to the vampire's lair.~
@49258 = ~I'll return when the vampire is destroyed.~
@49259 = ~I think there's one in... in Isabella's pack. I'll get it for you.~
@49260 = ~I don't want to leave Isabella's body. Please, just find the vampire's corpse and stake it.~
@49261 = ~Luck be with you.~
@49262 = ~Hello again! Hope your travels find you well.~
@49263 = ~You certainly deserve a reward, I can't argue with that. Unfortunately, the shield I found went missing earlier. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?~
@49264 = ~I took it. It didn't belong to you.~
@49265 = ~I have no idea what you're talking about.~
@49266 = ~The shield is mine now.~
@49267 = ~I'm not of a mind to worry about it. The vampire's dead. That's all that matters.~
@49268 = ~Oh... hello.~ [BD49268]
@49269 = ~How are you holding up, Ikros?~
@49270 = ~That's good, I... I'm sorry. I'm still a bit stunned.~
@49271 = ~Thanks. Now turn over the shield, as Isabella agreed.~
@49272 = ~Still a bit stunned. I can't—I can't believe she's gone... Excuse me, please. I need a moment. Forgive me.~ [BD49272]

@49274 = ~The typical throwing dagger has a pointed, usually double-edged blade, as opposed to a knife, which has a single edge and is a bit shorter than the dagger. Unlike a normal dagger, this one has a smaller handle and is balanced for throwing. It is also enchanted to make it more effective in combat. Since the throwing dagger is designed differently than a normal dagger, it is not very effective as a melee weapon.

I found a halfling named Takos sitting in the ruins of his inn. Rowdy crusaders, mercenaries, I assume, burned the inn to smoldering timbers and they—or someone else—stole three of Takos's family heirlooms. I should keep watch for a shield, a mirror, and a cloak.~
@49290 = ~Halfling Treasures

In the caverns beneath Dragonspear I found several injured crusaders, poisoned by some underground fungus. There's little I can do for them—perhaps I can find someone down here who can help them.~
@49330 = ~Slime Sickness

The crusaders have succumbed to their illness.

I found a hatch of wyrmlings trapped in a cavern. They were pitiful blind things that had fallen to eating each other to survive. Their minds had long since decayed into fury and pain. All I could do was end them.~
@49405 = ~The Lost

A group of ghosts are trapped in a cavern, lost. If I find a way to the Fugue Plane, I should bring their remains there.~

I found an ettin ghost who I think is missing his club. If I find it, he might be able to move on.~

I returned the club to the ettin ghost. Unfortunately, he gave me a reward. I don't think I'll ever be able to un-see that. If I ever run into a giant in need of help again, I'll establish a firm "no nudity" policy beforehand.~
@49408 = ~The Lost

Edwin's enemy, the Red Wizard Vichand, is dead.

Bridgefort's wizard, Wynan Hess, could not prevent a crusade attack. Now an enchanted rock is slowly killing everyone in the fort, myself included. If I cannot find the scroll to reverse the enchantment, it would be wise to leave this place soon. The scroll should be somewhere in the crusader camp, probably in the hands of a wizard.~

@49517 = ~I'm still working on finding a way to help with your horses. How are they doing?~
@49518 = ~I've spoken to Frair Tajik. Unfortunately, I couldn't convince him to help you.~
@49519 = ~Did Frair Tajik come and help your horses?~
@49520 = ~Goodbye again.~
@49521 = ~They fight their sickness with all their strength, but I don't know how much longer they can go on.~
@49522 = ~Such discourtesy ill becomes you, <CHARNAME>. There's no call for it. Please forgive <PRO_HIMHER>, Senderin.~
@49523 = ~I understand. Situations like this bring out the worst in all of us. Farewell.~
@49524 = ~I'll not hold that against you. A situation such as this brings out the worst in everyone.~
@49525 = ~I'm so huuuuuungry... ~
@49526 = ~I would help you if I could. But I cannot.~
@49527 = ~Try and think of something else. Talking about it won't make you less hungry.~
@49528 = ~Hunger is good for the soul.~
@49529 = ~What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.~
@49530 = ~Easy for you to say. You're not starving.~
@49531 = ~Merome! Stop bothering <PRO_HIMHER>. Forgive him, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. He's young.~
@49532 = ~Don't lie to the boy, <CHARNAME>. The truth is harsh, but it will serve him better than empty platitudes.~
@49533 = ~You CAN help me. Help the horses.~
@49534 = ~They mean that much to you?~
@49535 = ~I'm working on it.~
@49536 = ~Those nags are beyond anyone's help.~
@49537 = ~P-please, <CHARNAME>. That sort—sort of at-attitude helps no one.~
@49538 = ~And why not? It isn't as though there are any other matters of great import that require attention at hand.~
@49539 = ~The horses are our lives. This illness that consumes them also eats away at us. Should they die... Best not to think of it. Luck to you.~
@49540 = ~We appreciate the effort.~
@49541 = ~Don't give up hope yet. I certainly haven't. Frair will come around, I'm sure.~
@49542 = ~I just wish the effort had delivered better results.~
@49543 = ~As you should.~
@49544 = ~No, he won't. We're going to die. We're going to die of empty bellies.~
@49545 = ~Don't be so melodramatic, Merome. Never mind him. Thank you so much for at least trying to help us. It means more than you know. Farewell.~
@49546 = ~For all the good it did us. We're going to die. We're going to die of empy bellies.~
@49547 = ~We're going to die. We're going to die of empty bellies.~
@49548 = ~Thank you! Thank you so much. I feel I should offer you some sort of payment...~
@49549 = ~Not at all. I'm just glad the horses are back in good health. Now if you'll excuse me, I've other matters to attend to.~
@49550 = ~I've always wanted a steed of my own. Perhaps I could buy one of the pair I helped save?~
@49551 = ~What a coincidence. I feel exactly the same way.~
@49552 = ~How much gold do you have?~
@49553 = ~He did, yes. Tart and Bress are doing much better. Hopefully, this situation will end soon and they'll be able to graze properly again. Thank you so much. I feel I should offer you some reward...~
@49554 = ~Think nothing of it. I'm just glad Tart and Bress are back in good health. Now if you'll excuse me, I've other matters to attend to.~
@49555 = ~I've always wanted a steed of my own. Perhaps we could arrange for me to buy Tart or Bress?~
@49556 = ~What a coincidence. I feel exactly the same way.~
@49557 = ~How much gold do you have?~
@49558 = ~You want to... RIDE them?~
@49559 = ~Ja, of course! What is a horse for, if not to carry a stout adventurer on his journey?~
@49560 = ~You're not very smart, are you? These horses aren't for riding. They're for eating. Why did you think I was so hungry?~
@49561 = ~That's why you wanted Tart and Bress healed? So you could eat them?~
@49562 = ~You don't ride your horses?~
@49563 = ~If you eat horses, I have no idea why you were hungry. You had two of them right there.~
@49564 = ~Ride an eating horse? What a disgusting notion.~
@49565 = ~I wouldn't want to eat diseased horse. Would you? Or one that's been ridden on either, come to think of it. It would be unsanitary.~
@49566 = ~You can't let <PRO_HIMHER> take an eating horse for riding, Mum. You just can't.~
@49567 = ~Gold is well and good, <CHARNAME>, but we'll keep the horses. Here, take this helm as a reward instead. Thank you again for your help. You've saved our lives. I'll not forget that. Farewell.~
@49568 = ~And thank you again for your help. You've saved my life and the life of my son. I'll not forget that. Farewell.~
@49569 = ~The crusade got all our gold along with the horses, so we've none to offer you. Perhaps you'd be interested in purchasing Tart or Bress? At a very generous discount, of course.~
@49570 = ~A steed of my own would make my journeys less taxing, I must admit.~
@49571 = ~I've little use for a horse.~
@49572 = ~You want me to give you money? I think you misunderstand how rewards work, half-elf.~
@49573 = ~Here, take this helm, then. It was my husband's, and is the most valuable thing I possess. If you'll not wear it, it should fetch a good price in any reasonable-sized market.~
@49574 = ~Thank you for your help. You've saved our lives. We'll not soon forget that. Farewell.~
@49575 = ~So FULL... I don't know if I can keep it all down.~
@49576 = ~You'd better keep it down. I don't want Tart to go to waste.~
@49577 = ~How are you, <CHARNAME>? Is all well? ~
@49578 = ~I'm hopeful the situation with the crusade will be resolved in short order.~
@49579 = ~As well as can be expected. Which isn't well at all, but life goes on.~
@49580 = ~It will be substantially better once I stop talking to you.~
@49581 = ~So it does. Thanks again for your help with the horses.~
@49582 = ~Tart was delicious. I knew she would be...~
@49583 = ~Excuse us. We need to rest and let our meal settle. Good <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@49584 = ~I'm sure it will be. Thanks again for your assistance with Tart and Bress.~
@49585 = ~Then we'll not keep you. Farewell.~
@49586 = ~Hello. If you're here to see Tart, you're going to have to wait a few hours. Haw!~
@49587 = ~Merome! Where did you learn your manners? Please forgive my son, <CHARNAME>. How are you? Is all well?~
@49588 = ~I'm hopeful the situation with the crusade will be resolved in short order.~
@49589 = ~As well as can be expected. Which isn't well at all, but life goes on.~
@49590 = ~Well enough. But it will be substantially improved once I stop talking to you.~
@49591 = ~Hm, what, mm? What? Oh, uh, hello. Uh, excuse me, I've got to go.~ [BD49591]
@49592 = ~Well enough. What are you doing here, Glint Gardnersonson? And before you attempt to evade the question, please know: This conversation will not end until I receive a satisfactory answer.~
@49593 = ~I don't believe we've met. I am <CHARNAME>.~
@49594 = ~Go where, exactly? Who are you?~
@49595 = ~What's your name, gnome?~
@49596 = ~Bide a moment. I would speak with you. What's your name?~
@49597 = ~Go, then. I've better things to do than talk to you.~
@49598 = ~Yes. Uh, that's good. Right. Bye!~ [BD49598]
@49599 = ~Yes, yes, yes, you are, aren't you? That's fantastic. Well, if you'll excuse me...~ [BD49599]
@49600 = ~I don't believe I caught your name.~
@49601 = ~I can see you've got a lot on the go right now. I'll leave you to it.~
@49602 = ~You seem rather anxious not to talk with me, friend. Have I offended you in some way?~
@49603 = ~I'll be happy to—once you've told me your name.~
@49604 = ~Begone, gnome.~
@49605 = ~Offended me? No, no, no, no, not at all. I'm just— Hello. I'm Glint. Glint "Three-Eyes" Gardnersonson. How are you?~ [BD49605]
@49606 = ~Quite well, thanks for asking. And you?~
@49607 = ~Three-Eyes?~
@49608 = ~What exactly do you do, Glint? There aren't too many gnomes who'd willingly join a military expedition.~
@49609 = ~I'll be better once I know what you're up to. Don't deny it—there's something off about you, I can tell.~
@49610 = ~I'm a little busy right at the moment.~ [BD49610]
@49611 = ~Doing what? Perhaps I can help.~
@49612 = ~Be about your business, then.~
@49613 = ~My name? Oh right, right, my name. I'm Glint. Glint "Three-Eyes" Gardnersonson. Pleased to meet you.~ [BD49613]
@49614 = ~And I, you. How did you come to be part of this motley troupe, Glint?~
@49615 = ~Three-Eyes?~
@49616 = ~What exactly do you do, Glint? Of the gnomes I know, there are few who'd willingly join a military expedition.~
@49617 = ~What exactly do you do, Glint? I don't know many of our kind who'd willingly join a military expedition.~
@49618 = ~That will be a short-lived pleasure. Farewell.~
@49619 = ~Ah, yes. Yes. An old nickname. That's how many eyes Mum said she had to keep on me to make sure I stayed out of trouble. Turns out she really needed four eyes, but that—that's a long story.~ [BD49619]
@49620 = ~A story I'd be most interested in hearing, if you're willing to share it. Would you consider joining me for a time?~
@49621 = ~You sound like exactly the kind of person I like to have in my company. You should join me. ~
@49622 = ~I don't care to hear it. Be on your way.~
@49623 = ~Willingly might be pushing it...~ [BD49623]
@49624 = ~I am a cleric of Baravar Cloakshadow. May I have a minute to talk to you about the Lords of the Golden Hills?~ [BD49624]
@49625 = ~A minute hardly seems sufficient. Join me; you can tell me all about yourself and your gods.~
@49626 = ~You may have a minute, but not this one. I now know what you are, but I don't know what you do. Specifically, I don't know what you're doing here.~
@49627 = ~Gods, no.~
@49628 = ~Oh. A pity. They're really quite interesting. Well, if you'll excuse me, I've important matters to attend to. Bye for now!~ [BD49628]
@49629 = ~Ah. All right. Uh, yes. Join you. I can do that.~ [BD49629]
@49630 = ~Hang on. I don't recognize you, gnome. And I should recognize everyone in this caravan. I'm Captain Schael Corwin of the Flaming Fist. Who the hells are you?~ [BD49630]
@49631 = ~I'd like to know that myself. I don't recognize you, gnome. Who are you?~ [BD49631]
@49632 = ~And you don't know any more now. I know who signed up for this mission, and Glint Gardnerson wasn't on the list.~ [BD49632]
@49633 = ~GardnersonSON. Two sons. Long story.~ [BD49633]
@49634 = ~I don't give two tugs of a dead dog's tail what your name is. What are you doing here?~ [BD49634]
@49635 = ~My bet's on "nothing good." I know all the men assigned to this mission. The name Gardnerson isn't on the list.~ [BD49635]
@49636 = ~Before you do that, maybe Gardnerson can explain to us exactly what he's doing here. He's not one of us.~ [BD49636]
@49637 = ~He didn't. I know everyone assigned to join us. There's no Gardnerson on that list.~ [BD49637]
@49638 = ~Wait a moment, <CHARNAME>. Something's off here. I know the name of everyone who's joined us so far. There's no Gardnerson on that list.~ [BD49638]
@49639 = ~Oh, all right. You've caught me. I'm not supposed to be here, not officially, at least. My mum definitely thinks I should be here, and it's usually easier to go along with her than argue.~ [BD49639]
@49640 = ~Your mother sent you?~
@49641 = ~You'd rather battle armed religious zealots than argue with your mother?~
@49642 = ~You do whatever your mother asks? Pathetic.~
@49643 = ~You haven't met my mother.~ [BD49643]
@49644 = ~Spoken like someone who's never had to deal with my mother. I should be so lucky. Aw, nah, I didn't mean that. She's lovely, really. She's just... insistent. Like an avalanche or a tidal wave.~ [BD49644]
@49645 = ~Family's very important to the Gardnersonsons. I've a number of relatives 'twixt Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep. Mum wanted me to check on them and make sure they're all right.~ [BD49645]
@49646 = ~A worthy goal—one I would help you achieve, if you'll allow it. Join me. Together, we will find your family.~
@49647 = ~A reasonable thing to do, considering the circumstances.~
@49648 = ~Go to the camp commander and explain your presence here. You'll be put to work, but at least you're not at risk of being mistaken for a crusader.~
@49649 = ~I'll leave you to your business, but don't expect me to come to your aid if someone mistakes you for a crusader.~
@49650 = ~Far be it from me to say no to an offer of help. Count me in.~ [BD49650]
@49651 = ~That may be the first time in history someone's considered anything my mother wanted reasonable.~ [BD49651]
@49652 = ~Join me. I'll help you find your relatives.~
@49653 = ~Go to the camp commander and introduce yourself. Explain why you're here. The last thing you need is someone mistaking you for a crusader and cutting you down.~
@49654 = ~We're done here. Be on your way.~
@49655 = ~Yeah. Yeah, that could get ugly. Thank you. I'll report in immediately.~ [BD49655]
@49656 = ~On my way. Right. I'll do that. Thanks. Bye!~ [BD49656]
@49657 = ~Fair enough, fair enough. More than fair, really. Middling, at least. Thank you. Bye!~ [BD49657]
@49658 = ~Ah-ya. What can I do for ya?~ [BD49658]
@49659 = ~Uncle Hoach? Is that you?~ [BD49659]
@49660 = ~Ah-ya. Reckon it is at that. How ya doin', nephew?~
@49661 = ~This is your uncle, Glint?~
@49662 = ~Glint? You didn't tell me you had relatives in the fort.~
@49663 = ~We don't have time for a reunion right now, Glint. Talk fast.~
@49664 = ~Oh, where's my head at? <CHARNAME>, this is my uncle Hoach Randymonk. Uncle, this is <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate.~ [BD49664]
@49665 = ~Bloody hells, where is my head at? <CHARNAME>, this is my uncle, Hoach Randymonk.~ [BD49665]
@49666 = ~Randymonk? That... is a name with a tale to tell.~ [BD49666]
@49667 = ~Shar preserve me... Are you actually blushing, son of Selûne?~ [BD49667]
@49668 = ~Ja, he is. Most definitely. Old Voghiln's made many a lady blush—I know the signs. The monk blushes, there can be no doubting it.~ [BD49668]
@49669 = ~No. Not in the slightest. It is simply a... curious name. That is all.~ [BD49669]
@49670 = ~Uncle, this is the hero of Baldur's Gate, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD49670]
@49671 = ~Is <PRO_HESHE> now. Isn't that a thing?~
@49672 = ~It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.~
@49673 = ~Yes, though I'm not exactly sure what kind of thing it is. Good to meet you, Hoach.~
@49674 = ~It's something. How much longer is this going to take, Glint?~
@49675 = ~Pshaw. Ain't no great thing, meetin' someone like me. Still 'n all, I'm pleased t'make your acquaintance. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got some work t'do. ~
@49676 = ~What sort of work do you do, Hoach?~
@49677 = ~Don't we all.~
@49678 = ~We'll leave you to it.~
@49679 = ~He's one of the greatest cobblers this side of Waterdeep. How have you been, Uncle? Mum's worried about you.~ [BD49679]
@49680 = ~Aw, y'r mother just like t'worry, that's all. I'm stuck in this fort 'n all, but there's plenty got it worse than me. I'm fine. You tell y'r mother that, when ya get the chance.~
@49681 = ~How've you been, uncle? Mum's been worrying herself sick about you.~ [BD49681]
@49682 = ~I'll do that, Uncle Hoach. And I'll come back and talk to you again soon, if I get the chance.~ [BD49682]
@49683 = ~I'll make it quick. How have you been, uncle? Mum hasn't heard from you in a while. She's worried sick.~ [BD49683]
@49684 = ~I'll come back and talk to you again soon, all right?~ [BD49684]
@49685 = ~Ah-ya. Don't see why not. You take care now. Crusaders, don'tcha know.~
@49686 = ~He's one of the greatest cobblers this side of Waterdeep.~ [BD49686]
@49687 = ~And what is one of the greatest cobblers this side of Waterdeep doing trapped in Bridgefort?~
@49688 = ~Really? Tell me, Hoach, can you do anything with these boots?~
@49689 = ~Fascinating. Truly. But we should be going now.~
@49690 = ~Same's everyone else in here: survivin'. ~
@49691 = ~Sure I could do somethin' to 'em. Reckon ya'll want me t'make 'em better, though. That's a whole other kettle o' fish. Let's take a look at 'em.~
@49692 = ~Ain't a lot t'work with, is there? But I can make somethin' of'm. Leave'm with me, come back in a day, I'll have you up 'n runnin'.~ [BD49692]
@49693 = ~Excellent. How does 1000 gold as payment sound to you?~
@49694 = ~How much will this cost?~
@49695 = ~I'd like to consider this a time before I make my decision.~
@49696 = ~Fer a friend o' my nephew? 1400 gold. ~
@49697 = ~I'm afraid I don't have that much.~
@49698 = ~Done.~
@49699 = ~You're joking.~
@49700 = ~When ya do, I'll be here. Till then, here's y'r boots back. Take care.~
@49701 = ~I like a laugh as much as the next fella, but I don't joke about boots. When ye're ready t'get serious about yer feet, ya know where t'find me.~
@49702 = ~Sounds like about 500 gold less'n the job's worth. But ye're a friend o' my nephew, so it'll do. Come back t'morrow; I'll have yer boots ready by then.~
@49703 = ~Come back t'morrow. I'll have 'em ready for ya then. Till then, take care o' yerself.~
@49704 = ~Ah-ya. What can I do for ya? ~
@49705 = ~You can tell me your name, to begin with. I am <CHARNAME>.~
@49706 = ~Hard to say. What do you do for everyone else?~
@49707 = ~Nothing I'd care for.~
@49708 = ~Ah-ya. Reckon y'are at that. Name's Hoach Randymonk. Cobbler by trade, but trade's been sufferin' a bit of late. ~
@49709 = ~A cobbler, you say? Is there anything you can do with these boots?~
@49710 = ~Sieges do tend to negatively affect business.~
@49711 = ~What do you want? You're wasting my time.~
@49712 = ~Reckon they do at that. 'S there anything I c'n do f'r ya?~
@49713 = ~Maybe. Can you do something with these boots?~
@49714 = ~Nothing springs to mind. I'll leave you to your work.~
@49715 = ~I doubt it highly. I'll be going now.~
@49716 = ~Ya may be right about that. I'll letcha be on y'r way, then. Take care.~
@49717 = ~If ya don't got somethin' f'r me t'do, I reckon that'd be for the best. Take care.~
@49718 = ~Sounds like a plan. Not much of a plan, but not much of a plan's still better'n no plan at all. Take care.~
@49719 = ~Little o' this, little o' that. Make a fair number o' boots, an' fix a fair number more, which makes sense, on account of me bein' a cobbler and all.~
@49720 = ~Very interesting. If I find my footwear in need of repair, I'll be in touch.~
@49721 = ~A cobbler, you say? Is there anything you can do with these boots I found?~
@49722 = ~This is a waste of time.~
@49723 = ~Sure I could do somethin' to 'em. Reckon ya'll want me t'make 'em better, though. That's a whole other kettle o' fish. Let's take a look at 'em.~ [BD49723]
@49724 = ~Ain't a lot t'work with, is there? But I can make somethin' of'm. Leave'm with me, come back in a day, I'll have you up 'n runnin'.~
@49725 = ~Excellent. How does 1000 gold as payment sound to you?~
@49726 = ~How much will this cost?~
@49727 = ~I'd like to consider this a time before I make my decision.~
@49728 = ~Fer you? Same as everyone else. 1500 gold.~
@49729 = ~I'm afraid I don't have that much.~
@49730 = ~Done.~
@49731 = ~You're joking.~
@49732 = ~When ya do, I'll be here. Till then, here's y'r boots back. Take care.~
@49733 = ~I like a laugh as much as the next fella, but I don't joke about boots. When yer ready t'get serious about yer feet, ya know where t'find me.~
@49734 = ~Sounds like about 500 gold less'n the job's worth. But I like ya well enough, so it'll do. Come back t'morrow, I'll have yer boots ready by then.~
@49735 = ~2000 would sound better.~
@49736 = ~I don't have that much.~
@49737 = ~2000 it is.~
@49738 = ~You must be joking.~
@49739 = ~Come back t'morrow. I'll have 'em ready for ya then. Till then, take care o' yerself. ~
@49740 = ~Ah-ya? What can I do f'r ya? ~
@49741 = ~I wanted to see how my boots were coming.~
@49742 = ~I thought Glint might want to speak with you.~
@49743 = ~How does this <DAYNIGHTALL> find you, sir?~
@49744 = ~I was wondering what you know of the crusade, and the woman who leads it.~
@49745 = ~Nothing. There is nothing you can do for me, nothing I would ever desire, at any rate.~
@49746 = ~Said it'd take a day. It's been a day. Here's y'r boots.~
@49747 = ~Said it'd take a day. It been a day yet?~
@49748 = ~Not yet. I thought I'd check in regardless, in case you were ahead of schedule.~
@49749 = ~Yes. It's been at least a day.~
@49750 = ~I want my boots, damn it.~
@49751 = ~Welllll... I'm not. Come see me when I said ya should.~
@49752 = ~Ya can't fool a fool. 'Tain't been a day yet. If it had been, boots'd be done. Boots aren't done—it ain't been a day. Come back when it's been a day, 'n yer boots'll be ready.~
@49753 = ~Ah-ya? Well, I want to sprout wings 'n fly to Selûne. If I had t' guess, you'll get yer boots first. But ya won't get 'em sooner'n I promised 'em. Come back when a day's passed, an' I'll have 'em ready for ya.~
@49754 = ~Y'got somethin' ya want to say t'me, son?~
@49755 = ~Mum's terribly worried about you, Hoach. When this is done, you need to send word to Baldur's Gate that you're all right.~ [BD49755]
@49756 = ~Reckon I c'n do that. Assumin' we get out o' this place alive, which, I'll be honest, is not somethin' I'm inclined to assume at this point m'self.~
@49757 = ~You will survive this, Hoach Randymonk. I swear it.~
@49758 = ~All things considered, that seems a wise assumption not to make.~
@49759 = ~Assume nothing. The only route to success is to determine your desired outcome and act to achieve it with neither hesitation nor regret.~
@49760 = ~Caelar? Never met her m'self. They say she has a way with people. As fer the crusade, well, it's outside these walls and I'm in 'em. All things considered that seems the best. Don't know much about 'em, truth be told.~
@49761 = ~Now if ya'll excuse me, I've got work needs doin'. Take care.~
@49762 = ~I would say I'm somewhere in the area of fair t'middlin'. There's those got it worse than me, sure enough.~
@49763 = ~There's somethin' to whatcha say. Never been much fer determinin' outcomes, m'self. Maybe I'll try it sometime. Now if ya'll excuse me, I've got work needs doin'. Take care.~
@49764 = ~I'll be holdin' you to that, hero.~
@49765 = ~You take care of yourself too, Uncle Hoach. Don't make me bring bad news to Mum. You know how she takes that sort of thing.~ [BD49765]
@49766 = ~Ah-ya. Seen her kill many a messenger in my time. I'll do what I can t'not make you one of 'em.~
@49767 = ~I was doing quite well prior to all this, you know. I'd actually put a fair amount of money towards building a shrine to Baravar.~ [BD49767]
@49768 = ~Interestin'. But maybe you should go now, otherwise we'll have nothin' t'talk about next time. Take care.~
@49769 = ~So how were yer boots? Work out all right for ya? Comfortable?~ [BD49769]
@49770 = ~Very. Fantastic work, Master Randymonk.~
@49771 = ~They seemed comfortable enough—right up until I put them on and they nearly killed me.~
@49772 = ~Comfortable? The damnable things could have killed someone, you pint-sized maniac!~
@49773 = ~I haven't tried them yet. I'm sure they'll be fine.~
@49774 = ~They are satisfactory.~
@49775 = ~That name, it makes me... uncomfortable.~ [BD49775]
@49776 = ~Ah-ya. They'll work out just fine. Still... might want t'try 'em out, just t'be on the safe side. Take care now.~
@49777 = ~Glad they worked out fer ya. Well, back to the grindstone f'r me. Take care.~
@49778 = ~Nearly killed's better'n actually killed. Coulda been worse.~
@49779 = ~True enough. Funny way to die, though, surrounded by enemies but killed by one's own footwear.~
@49780 = ~I want my money back, you leaking sack of donkey dung!~
@49781 = ~I'll give you one chance and one chance only. Return my money, you deranged loon.~
@49782 = ~I wanna have a fishtail an' lure sailors to their doom with my enchantin' song. Can't always get what you want. Take care.~ [BD49782]
@49783 = ~There's no call for insults, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD49783]
@49784 = ~Wellll... Seein' as ye're a friend o' my nephew, I s'pose a refund isn't completely out of order. Here y'go. Take care now.~
@49785 = ~I s'pose a refund isn't completely out of order. Here's yer money. Be off with ya now.~
@49786 = ~It's my money now. Be off with ya. Yer face is buggin' me.~
@49787 = ~That would be hilarious—if it happened to anyone else.~ [BD49787]
@49788 = ~Like the man said, sometimes ya kick, sometimes ya get kicked. Sorry the boots didn't work out. Stay safe—safe as ya can.~
@49789 = ~Make sure you do the same, Uncle Hoach. I don't want to have to tell Mum something happened to you.~ [BD49789]
@49790 = ~I've had it, Sempek. I've had it!~
@49791 = ~Just let it go, Damius. It's not worth it.~
@49792 = ~I tell you, if that gnome says one more word to me, ONE WORD, it'll be the last one he ever utters again!~
@49793 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you. I am Sempek of the Daggerford militia. This is Damius. Join us, have a drink. ~
@49794 = ~Well met, Sempek, Damius. I'd like nothing better than to join you, but unfortunately I have things to attend to.~
@49795 = ~Sounds good to me.~
@49796 = ~I'll not waste my time on you.~
@49797 = ~See? You see? Another bloody gnome—they're all the same.~
@49798 = ~You're having trouble with a gnome in the Daggerford militia? His name's not Pritchard, is it?~ [BD49798]
@49799 = ~Just try and ignore Damius, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. He's not as bad with gnomes as he sounds, he's just having some difficulty right now.~
@49800 = ~It sounds better than good to mighty Voghiln, ho ho! A powerful thirst is upon me. Pass the wineskin, unless you have a cask hidden somewhere. If you do, pass them both.~ [BD49800]
@49801 = ~Things more important than having a drink? We need to have a little chat about your priorities.~ [BD49801]
@49802 = ~As you wish. It's no skin off my arse. More for us to drink, eh, Damius? Pass me that wineskin.~
@49803 = ~Aye, that's the one. Pritchard Gardnerson.~
@49804 = ~GardnersonSON. Long story.~ [BD49804]
@49805 = ~It's gonna get a lot shorter if some bloody gnomes don't shut their bloody mouths and stop acting like they're running Stonehand's show.~
@49806 = ~Do you know where we can find this Gardnersonson?~
@49807 = ~Let's get out of here, Glint. I'm thinking these men are no friends of the family Gardnersonson.~
@49808 = ~I've heard enough. We'll be going now.~
@49809 = ~You're probably right about that, but before we go, I need to ask. Kind sirs, where can I find this Gardnersonson?~ [BD49809]
@49810 = ~Last I heard, he was badgering Stonehand about strategy, like he knows something about it. Find her and you'll find him. Or at least pieces of him. Stonehand's not known for her patience.~
@49811 = ~So listen—you look like you've seen your share of violence. And you're still alive and in reasonably good shape by the looks of you, so I'm guessing you're pretty good at the whole killing of others thing. Am I right?~
@49812 = ~I kill when I must, and I take little joy from it. I mislike the direction this conversation is taking. I'll be leaving now.~
@49813 = ~Why do you ask?~
@49814 = ~Who do you want killed, and how much are you offering?~
@49815 = ~There's a gnome in our contingent—we're from Daggerford—named Gardnerson. ~
@49816 = ~You mean Glint?~
@49817 = ~Go on.~
@49818 = ~I don't like where this conversation is going. Let's stop talking now.~
@49819 = ~You want this Gardnerson killed? I can do that—if the price is right.~
@49820 = ~What? No. His name's Pritchard. Pompous jackass, he thinks he's better than the rest of us. He thinks he's in command here. Well, second in command, after General Stonehand.~
@49821 = ~His name's Pritchard. Pompous jackass, he thinks he's better than the rest of us. He THINKS he's in command here. Well, second in command, after General Stonehand. ~
@49822 = ~He needs to be taught a lesson, and I'm thinking you might be the <PRO_MANWOMAN> to do it. What do you say? Interested?~
@49823 = ~In murdering one who fights against Caelar? No. I am quite definitely not interested. ~
@49824 = ~I might be.~
@49825 = ~I can kill this Gardnerson for you. What will you give me in exchange?~
@49826 = ~I came upon a crusader a couple days ago who was carrying some interesting potions—one of fire giant strength, the other of fortitude. I was saving them for the final assault on Dragonspear, but I'll gladly part with them if it gets Gardnerson out of my hair. ~
@49827 = ~You plot to murder one of your own and expect me to help you? No, no, I'll not countenance such a thing. Not now, not ever.~
@49828 = ~I've killed for less than that. We have a deal.~
@49829 = ~Consider it done.~
@49830 = ~Bloody hells, Damius. Now you've done it. Let's get out of here quick, before <PRO_HESHE> tells anyone!~
@49831 = ~I'm sorry to hear that. Not as sorry as you're gonna be, though. Die!~
@49832 = ~Glad to hear it. Last I heard, Gardnerson was badgering General Stonehand about strategy—like he knows anything about that. Wait until he's alone, then take care of him.~
@49833 = ~What the hells is going on here?~ [BD49833]
@49834 = ~Pritchard Gardnerson, I presume?~
@49835 = ~Calm yourself, friend. The danger is over.~
@49836 = ~Sorry, who are you?~
@49837 = ~These men were traitors, working for Caelar. I slew them.~
@49838 = ~GardnersonSON. Explain yourself! Why have you killed my men?~ [BD49838]
@49839 = ~They plotted to kill you.~
@49840 = ~It was self-defense. They drew on me, I had to respond in kind.~
@49841 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate doesn't answer to you, gnome.~
@49842 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate doesn't answer to you.~
@49843 = ~Pritchard! Cousin, it's me, Glint.~ [BD49843]
@49844 = ~Glint? What are you doing here? What's going on? Someone explain this to me now!~ [BD49844]
@49845 = ~I'm sorry to have to say this, Master Gardnersonson, but these men were plotting to kill you.~
@49846 = ~Glint? Would you care to explain this to your cousin?~
@49847 = ~It's simple enough—these men attacked me. I responded in kind. You see the result.~
@49848 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate. I don't answer to you. If you have a problem with that, take it up with the Flaming Fist. I am here at the behest of the Grand Dukes.~
@49849 = ~What? I don't believe it. ~
@49850 = ~I understand why you wouldn't want to. Nevertheless, I speak the truth. If you don't believe me, take it up with the Flaming Fist. I am here at the behest of the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate.~
@49851 = ~That's unfortunate. But it doesn't make what I say untrue.~
@49852 = ~You call the hero of Baldur's Gate a liar?~
@49853 = ~What...? I-I don't believe it. ~
@49854 = ~I understand why you wouldn't want to. Nevertheless, I speak the truth. If you don't believe me, take it up with the Flaming Fist. I am here at the behest of the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate.~
@49855 = ~I'm sorry to hear that. But, believe it or don't, I speak the truth.~
@49856 = ~What you believe matters little to me. Begone.~
@49857 = ~Aye, aye. I'll be doing that, just you see if I don't.~
@49858 = ~Pritchard Gardnersonson, lieutenant of the Daggerford militia. Who the hells are you?~ [BD49858]
@49859 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. I regret to be to the one to tell you this, but these men meant you ill. They plotted to kill you. ~
@49860 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. I am called the hero of Baldur's Gate by most. Is there something else you'd rather call me? ~
@49861 = ~This—this—this isn't over! We are not done, you and I!~
@49862 = ~You've killed members of Daggerford's militia! That's the last mistake you'll make for a long time.~
@49863 = ~The hero of—? No, no, I don't—forgive me, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I was just—taken aback by all this. I'll, ah—I'll let you be on your way.~
@49864 = ~Danger? What danger? What are you talking about?~
@49865 = ~These treacherous cowards plotted to kill a member of Daggerford's militia named Gardnerson.~
@49866 = ~I acted in self-defense. These men drew on me. I had no choice but to respond in kind.~
@49867 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate doesn't answer to you. If you've a problem with that, take it up with the Flaming Fist.~
@49868 = ~I'm really sorry about all this, Pritchard. Uh, there was a—a misunderstanding, that's all. It got out of hand. Unfortunate, but it happens. You might still be able to revive these men if you act quickly.~ [BD49868]
@49869 = ~Someone fetch a cleric! These men need help!~
@49870 = ~Where are you going? I'm an officer of the Daggerford militia! Do as I say! You can't leave! Take <PRO_HIMHER>! Take <PRO_HIMHER>, damn it!~
@49871 = ~This—this—this isn't over! We are not done, you and I!~
@49872 = ~Damn it all, Stonehand! Listen to what I'm saying!~
@49873 = ~I've listened, Pritchard. I listened once, then I listened again, then I listened a dozen more times!~
@49874 = ~Now I'm done listening. Open your mouth again and I move on to horrible maiming!~
@49875 = ~You're out of your bloody mind, Pritchard. Keep this up and you'll be out of bloody teeth too!~ [BD49875]
@49876 = ~If we move now, we can take Caelar's people by surprise!~
@49877 = ~You don't know that, and even if you did, it's not your decision to make. Just let it go, Pritchard. Like it or not, we aren't the ones who get to make the call.~ [BD49877]
@49878 = ~Pritchard? Pritchard Gardnerson?~
@49879 = ~Ho there, Stonehand. What's going on here?~
@49880 = ~What call would that be, General Stonehand?~
@49881 = ~If you do not get to make it, then who will?~
@49882 = ~Trouble with your dogs, Stonehand? Perhaps you should give them a treat. Or put them down.~
@49883 = ~Pritchard! Cousin, it's me—Glint!~ [BD49883]
@49884 = ~GardnersonSON. Who are you, now?~
@49885 = ~Pritchard, this is the hero of Baldur's Gate, <CHARNAME>. <CHARNAME>, Pritchard Gardnersonson.~ [BD49885]
@49886 = ~We've met. Much to my regret.~
@49887 = ~A hero in Baldur's Gate, a pariah in Dragonspear. Such is life, eh?~ [BD49887]
@49888 = ~Oh, right. You're the one who had the... incident crossing Boareskyr. How do you almost know my name?~ [BD49888]
@49889 = ~I believe I know a relative of yours. Glint?~
@49890 = ~There's a couple of men around the corner who asked me to kill you. Damius and Sempek, do you know them?~
@49891 = ~I was asked to find you and bring you to Quartermaster Belegarm. He's got a gnomish item he believes you might be interested in.~
@49892 = ~I must have overheard it somewhere. Excuse me.~
@49893 = ~My cousin's here? Bloody hells. Lock up the gold. I guess I'd best go find him and say hello. We'll continue this discussion later, Haither.~
@49894 = ~It'd be healthier for you if we didn't.~ [BD49894]
@49895 = ~Fare thee well.~
@49896 = ~WHAT? Those ungrateful swine, I'll have them drawn and quartered!~
@49897 = ~The hells you will. I'll deal with this. And you, <CHARNAME>—stop making mischief, you hear me? We've got enough problems here without you making more of 'em. But you did good bringing this to my attention, and now I've got someone I can hit in good conscience. Here, take this as thanks.~ [BD49897]
@49898 = ~Pritchard here thinks we should send a small force into Dragonspear to try and take out Caelar and end this mess before the real battle gets underway.~ [BD49898]
@49899 = ~As I EXPLAINED to him, we aren't operating independently here. The camp commanders have to agree on that sort of action.~ [BD49899]
@49900 = ~And you think they won't agree.~
@49901 = ~Democracy. It's a wonderful thing.~
@49902 = ~A force like this can only function with a single leader. One voice must command, or chaos will reign.~
@49903 = ~Nederlok might go for it. De Lancie, though? He's happy enough try and starve Caelar out. Anything to avoid bloodshed.~ [BD49903]
@49904 = ~Now, if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go talk to a hole in the ground about me peeing in it.~ [BD49904]
@49905 = ~Interesting. Lead the way.~
@49906 = ~Fare thee well. Now, Haither, where were we?~
@49907 = ~I was right here. You were going somewhere else, before I wring your bloody gnome neck.~ [BD49907]
@49908 = ~Aye, well. Here we are. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've gotta talk to a hole in the ground about peeing in it.~ [BD49908]
@49909 = ~Watch your mouth, <CHARNAME>, or you're the one that'll be put down. Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta talk to a hole in the ground about peeing in it.~ [BD49909]
@49910 = ~Glint? What are you doing here?~ [BD49910]
@49911 = ~He's looking for you, Pritchard.~
@49912 = ~Glint, I'll let you explain.~
@49913 = ~He's leaving. As am I.~
@49914 = ~Mum's been worried about the family. She sent me out to make sure everything's all right. Is it? Are you all right?~ [BD49914]
@49915 = ~I daresay I am. I'm a high-ranking member of the Daggerford militia. We were sent here to deal with that confounded Caelar.~
@49916 = ~As were we. I am <CHARNAME>.~
@49917 = ~How's that going for you?~
@49918 = ~Yet Caelar continues to confound you.~
@49919 = ~I've heard of you. You were involved in that... incident on Boareskyr Bridge.~
@49920 = ~Let's not talk of that, cousin. How is Aunt Wellsy? And Uncle Morsk?~ [BD49920]
@49921 = ~They're fine, Glint. Mother and father are both fine. Tell Auntie next time you see her. Now excuse me, please. I've important matters that require my attention. We can talk properly when this situation with Caelar is finally resolved.~
@49922 = ~It'd be a damn sight better if the camp commanders had either a modicum of courage or a hint of intelligence. We could end this siege inside of a day were we to move boldly and strike with precision.~ [BD49922]
@49923 = ~I'm, eh, sure you could. Excuse us, cousin. I need to talk to my friend in private a moment.~ [BD49923]
@49924 = ~I've gotta go, Pritchard. We'll talk later, all right?~ [BD49924]
@49925 = ~I need to speak with you about my cousin, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD49925]
@49926 = ~Of course, Glint.~
@49927 = ~I can't see any way to get out of this, so go ahead.~
@49928 = ~Your cousin is the last thing I wish to discuss right now.~
@49929 = ~You and me both. All right, I'll let it go for the moment.~ [BD49929]
@49930 = ~You may not have noticed this, but Pritchard... Well, he can be a bit of a handful. He's difficult enough under normal circumstances. Give him any kind of power and, well, it goes straight to his head.~ [BD49930]
@49931 = ~I was wondering if you could perhaps beat him to within an inch of his life.~ [BD49931]
@49932 = ~I'm really not comfortable with the direction this conversation is going.~
@49933 = ~Why on Toril would you want me to do that?~
@49934 = ~Absolutely.~
@49935 = ~Just try and stop me.~
@49936 = ~Glint, I can honestly say I would be delighted to do that for you.~
@49937 = ~If he stays in this camp, I guarantee you he's going to rub someone the wrong way—probably several someones. They're going to kill him. Kill him repeatedly, if history's anything to judge by.~ [BD49937]
@49938 = ~So you want me to nearly kill him, to convince him to leave the camp.~
@49939 = ~Sounds like there's a story there, but we'll save it for another day. You want me to beat your cousin into a bloody pulp? It will be done.~
@49940 = ~And you'd deny them this pleasure? Well, he is family. Very well. I'll do as you ask.~
@49941 = ~Exactly.~ [BD49941]
@49942 = ~That's a little extreme, isn't it?~
@49943 = ~All right. I'll do it, but only because you asked nicely and I don't really like your cousin much.~
@49944 = ~It's not often someone asks me to hurt a family member. I'll enjoy this.~
@49945 = ~You don't know Pritchard the way I do. There's only one way to get any message through that thick skull of his. Words alone just won't do it.~ [BD49945]
@49946 = ~I'm sorry, Glint. I just can't do that. The idea alone makes me uneasy.~
@49947 = ~Very well. I'll do this for you.~
@49948 = ~Fortunately, I have more than words at my disposal.~
@49949 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.~ [BD49949]
@49950 = ~I don't want him dead, you understand. I just need him... humbled. Beaten down enough that he'll agree to leave this place. He won't serve anyone being here, not himself, not his fellow militia members. He might help Caelar, but that's obviously not ideal.~ [BD49950]
@49951 = ~I thought the quartermaster was over there. ~
@49952 = ~So this item your quartermaster has for me—what is it?~
@49953 = ~<CHARNAME>? What is the item?~
@49954 = ~What are you doing—?~
@49955 = ~Help! Someone help me!~
@49956 = ~Mercy! Please, show mercy, I beg you!~ [BD49956]
@49957 = ~That's enough, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD49957]
@49958 = ~Let me live, please, please! I want to live!~
@49959 = ~You'll live. Go, get out of this camp. Return to Daggerford and your family and don't ever speak of what happened here again. Do you understand?~
@49960 = ~That's unfortunate, because you aren't going to.~
@49961 = ~How badly? How much is your wretched life worth to you?~
@49962 = ~Yes, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Thank you, thank you!~
@49963 = ~Here, take this dagger. It's a family heirloom, the most valuable thing I have. Take it and let me live, please.~
@49964 = ~Glint? Cousin? What's goin' on—I don't understand...~ [BD49964]
@49965 = ~I'm sorry, Pritchard. You've got to leave the camp. Go back to Daggerford.~ [BD49965]
@49966 = ~But—why...?~
@49967 = ~Glint fears for your life, Pritchard. There are people here who mean to harm you, even worse than you are now. As hard as it may be to believe, we did this out of love.~
@49968 = ~It's for your own good.~
@49969 = ~This is no place for a gnome like you.~
@49970 = ~Mum would never forgive me if I let you die, Pritchard. You've got to get out of here.~ [BD49970]
@49971 = ~This was going to be my chance... I was going to prove myself...~
@49972 = ~You're a good man, Pritchard. Don't become a good dead man.~ [BD49972]
@49973 = ~All—all right. I'll go. Here, take this dagger. It was Father's. He used it during the last two Dragonspear Wars. It's only fitting a Gardnersonson fighting this one wield it now. Goodbye, cousin. Farewell.~ [BD49973]
@49974 = ~You done the deed yet? Is that waddling bag of pus Pritchard still with us?~
@49975 = ~Where can I find Pritchard again?~
@49976 = ~For the moment. I'm working on it.~
@49977 = ~When he is, I'll let you know. Until then, don't talk to me.~
@49978 = ~No. He's gone, and he'll not be returning any time soon.~
@49979 = ~Pritchard Gardnerson won't be bothering you again, let's put it that way.~
@49980 = ~I have slain him. Give me what I was promised, or I'll do the same to you.~
@49981 = ~Right, right. Don't want to be associated with each other, just in case. Good idea.~
@49982 = ~Any time now would be good.~
@49983 = ~He's probably hanging around General Stonehand's tent, bothering her with his brilliant plans to end this bloody standoff. Try there.~
@49984 = ~You did it? All right! Here's the potions. Worth it to see that worthless lackwit gone.~
@49985 = ~Oh! Who are you?~ [BD49985]
@49986 = ~Don't be afraid. I'm <CHARNAME>. Are you with the crusade?~
@49987 = ~<CHARNAME>. Hero of Baldur's Gate. Perhaps you've heard of me? No? How long have you been in this wretched place?~
@49988 = ~Someone who values privacy. Return to your task and leave me to mine.~
@49989 = ~Rhonda? Is it really you? What are you doing down here?~ [BD49989]
@49990 = ~I don't even know how long I've been down here anymore. The crusade took my family, my father and brothers—I don't know what happened to them.~ [BD49990]
@49991 = ~Not by choice. They took my family, my father and brothers—I don't know what happened to them. ~

@49996 = ~They'll have little use for clothes where I'm going to send them.~

@50005 = ~Glint? Did the crusade catch you too?~
@50006 = ~No, I'm with my friend here—<CHARNAME>, this is my cousin Rhonda Swiftfootsdottir. Rhonda, <CHARNAME>—we're working against the crusade. Well, he is. I'm mostly just along for the ride.~ [BD50006]
@50007 = ~You've got to get out of here, Glint. ~
@50008 = ~You're the one who needs to leave, milady. This place isn't safe, and it's going to get even less safe by the time I'm done with it.~

@50010 = ~He will—after we've done what we came to do.~
@50011 = ~What are you planning?~
@50012 = ~That depends on whether we can get past those ogres and up to Dragonspear.~ [BD50012]
@50013 = ~Ogres? You mean Einer and Betror?~ [BD50013]
@50014 = ~You know them?~
@50015 = ~They're just down the stairs, arguing with one another, as far as I can tell.~
@50016 = ~I wasn't interested in their names. Can you convince them to let us pass?~
@50017 = ~Oh yes. You want to go up into Dragonspear? Let me talk to them, I'll get you up there.~

@50026 = ~Tharantis asked me to bring him a chain his sister wore. Did you know where it is?~

@50030 = ~Tharantis asked me to bring him a chain his sister wore. Did you find it anywhere?~
@50031 = ~Tharantis wants a chain his sister wore, but I didn't see it. Other items appear to be missing from the bodies too.~
@50032 = ~We could all use some rest. Now I must depart.~
@50033 = ~Wait a moment. I'm a Baravar Cloakshadow man myself, but isn't Lathander supposed to be called "the Morninglord"...?~ [BD50033]
@50034 = ~I didn't see anything like that while I was preparing the bodies. It may have been torn off in the chaos.~
@50035 = ~I noticed items missing from the other bodies too. A ring and a short sword.~
@50036 = ~Perhaps. Or perhaps we have a thief in our midst.~
@50037 = ~If you find it, bring it to Tharantis. I must depart.~
@50038 = ~What are you saying? Someone is robbing the dead?~
@50039 = ~It's not uncommon in circumstances such as these. Have you noticed anyone else near the bodies?~
@50040 = ~I think someone is robbing the corpses, and I think that someone is you.~
@50041 = ~Perhaps, perhaps not. It's no business of mine either way, and so I depart.~
@50042 = ~No one here would do such a... Wait.~
@50043 = ~Just before we closed the drawbridge, a man named Ymori arrived. He claimed to be a priest of Chauntea. He's a quiet sort, keeps to himself, but did good work. I haven't seen him since yesterday.~
@50044 = ~We can't jump to conclusions here, but I would like to speak to this man. We'll speak again as soon as I learn anything.~
@50045 = ~What does this Ymori look like?~
@50046 = ~Where can I find this priest of Chauntea?~
@50047 = ~A thief? Nonsense. I don't believe it.~ [BD50047]
@50048 = ~I'll return once I've tracked Ymori down. ~
@50049 = ~He's human, blonde, on the thin side. About twenty five years old, I'd say, dressed very plainly with a bit of a beard.~
@50050 = ~I don't know; I haven't seen him in a day. If he left, he couldn't have crossed the bridge. Perhaps he's in the woods nearby? ~
@50051 = ~Once again, you come to my aid. Thank you.~
@50052 = ~What? You must be joking. I swear by Sunspeaker I had nothing to do with this.~
@50053 = ~Lathander's holy weapon is called Dawnspeaker, not Sunspeaker.~
@50054 = ~Then how do you explain this ring I found in your pocket?~
@50055 = ~My apologies. You seemed like the likeliest suspect.~
@50056 = ~I've robbed no one! Nobody here would do such a— Wait. Wait...~
@50057 = ~Meddling fool! You should have left well enough alone. Servants, rise at my command! In Velsharoon's name!~
@50058 = ~May you go in peace.~
@50059 = ~Velsharoon! Lord of the Forsaken Crypt! I invoke the Pact of the Everlasting! ~
@50060 = ~Of all the unspeakable... This is an outrage. An outrage!~ [BD50060]
@50061 = ~What is it, Dynaheir?~
@50062 = ~They're just undead. They're dead... again... now.~
@50063 = ~You seem upset.~
@50064 = ~These are signs of the Lord of the Forsaken, a deity risen from the ranks of the Red Wizards. His name is Velsharoon, and thou must keep thine eyes open for one of his faithful: a caller of the dead, a necromancer.~ [BD50064]
@50065 = ~Thy must keep thine eyes open for a practitioner of necromancy, a caller of the dead. It was not this poor man.~
@50066 = ~Oh, this is delightful. Yes! Truly delightful.~ [BD50066]
@50067 = ~What is it, Edwin?~
@50068 = ~I don't find little delightful about the undead.~
@50069 = ~Explain yourself, mage.~
@50070 = ~The symbols carved into this sacrifice's flesh are signs of Velsharoon, Lord of the Forsaken! Someone put these bodies to good use. The dead man didn't raise them. There is a necromancer here, among the Bridgefortians. This is too, too good.~ [BD50070]
@50071 = ~Someone is putting all these bodies to good use. Heh heh. The dead man didn't raise them, so someone else who works with corpses did.~
@50072 = ~Back so soon? I suppose Ymori is long gone by now. ~
@50073 = ~Oh no. I found Ymori, all right. And the undead you had waiting for me.~
@50074 = ~That's one way to put it. I, however, am still here. Your little trap failed.~
@50075 = ~I'm still looking for him.~
@50076 = ~He can't have gone across Boareskyr, and the crusade would have little to offer. If he escaped the fort, he'd likely seek refuge in the woods.~
@50077 = ~I'm not ready to give up the search.~
@50078 = ~Ymori's body was mutilated as part of a dark ritual. Did you sacrifice him to conjure up those undead?~
@50079 = ~I found what was left of Ymori and I killed the undead guarding him. You're behind this, aren't you?~
@50080 = ~I've returned to kill you. It's the only fate fitting for a thief and a liar.~
@50081 = ~Wait, wait! You're wrong about me. Yes, I did kill Ymori, but I had good reason. I discovered he was a cultist of Velsharoon. He was stealing from the dead. I followed him into the woods late one night.~
@50082 = ~I discovered Ymori was a cultist of Velsharoon and was stealing from the dead. I followed him out into the woods late one night.~
@50083 = ~There, I interrupted his ritual and killed him. Then I cleansed his body through Lathander's grace in a ritual to strengthen our troops. I wanted only to protect our people!~
@50084 = ~One item, a ring, wasn't on Ymori's body. And you're the one who steered me to the woods where the undead waited. I don't believe you.~
@50085 = ~Lathander is a god of good and light. He would never countenance blood sacrifice.~
@50086 = ~You must be the priest of Velsharoon. That's why you tend to corpses and why you sent me into the clutches of the undead.~
@50087 = ~And how do you explain this ring I found in your pocket?~
@50088 = ~It's a good story—but not good enough. Tell me another. Make it the truth this time.~
@50089 = ~Why didn't you tell me this sooner? For dealing with the cultist before he hurt anyone else, you have my thanks, Junia.~
@50090 = ~I've had enough of this nonsense. I'll tell Khalid what I've learned and let him deal with this mess.~
@50091 = ~Follower of the vile Archmage of Necromancy! Thy foul machinations shall be exposed!~ [BD50091]
@50092 = ~Meddling fool! You should have left well enough alone. Yes, I stole the items, to help me attune my spells to each corpse. Ymori found me out. I slew him in Velsharoon's name, and will do the same to you! Servants! Rise and defend me!~
@50093 = ~Ymori found me out and I slew him in Velsharoon's name. And I will do the same to you! Servants! Rise and defend me!~
@50094 = ~I accept your thanks, though I did nothing you would not have in my position. Go in peace, my friend.~
@50095 = ~Forgive me, please. I'm still coming to terms with what happened to Kendra. I... need to be alone now.~
@50096 = ~Perhaps I can give you some slight measure of peace. I found your sister's necklace.~
@50097 = ~I understand.~
@50098 = ~Take care. ~
@50099 = ~You did? Let me see... yes, that's hers! Where did you find it?~
@50100 = ~The priest Junia wasn't what she claimed to be. She stole Kendra's necklace in order to raise your sister as a zombie. I dealt with her.~
@50101 = ~The priest Ymori was actually a cultist of Velsharoon who stole from the dead. He paid the price for his villainy.~
@50102 = ~It's a long story. What matters is you have it back.~
@50103 = ~That's not important. What's important is how much it's worth to you.~
@50104 = ~What do you mean? That's my dead sister's necklace!~
@50105 = ~And it must be worth a lot to you. Say 200 gold?~
@50106 = ~It's mine now, but that could change—for 100 gold pieces.~
@50107 = ~I'll not see one of us dead over a cheap piece of jewelry. Here, take it.~
@50108 = ~You treacherous swine... You probably stole the necklace in the first place. I have 50 gold and a few scrolls. Will that be enough for you, you vulture?~
@50109 = ~It will do. Hand it over.~
@50110 = ~Not good enough. I'm sure I can find find a buyer who'll pay what it's worth.~
@50111 = ~I changed my mind. Here, take the necklace.~
@50112 = ~Now get out of here. If I ever see your face again, I'll break it.~
@50113 = ~That's horrible... At least Kendra was avenged, and you found her necklace.~
@50114 = ~Indeed I did. Here it is.~
@50115 = ~Sometimes that's the best a hero can do. Here's the necklace.~
@50116 = ~I did. Now let's talk about how much it's worth to you.~
@50117 = ~Thank you. For everything.~
@50118 = ~That necklace is worth more to me than your wretched life, fiend!~
@50119 = ~I was hoping you'd ignore my warning. Now I've an excuse to give you the beating you deserve.~
@50120 = ~Thank you again, friend. For everything. ~
@50121 = ~Hello, friend. May you feel the radiance of Lathander. Is there anything I can help you with?~
@50122 = ~Can you heal me?~
@50123 = ~Do you have any healing potions for sale?~
@50124 = ~Nothing right now, thank you.~
@50125 = ~All my spells and supplies are being used to care for our wounded right now. Speak to Frair Tajik; he may be able to help you.~

I should pass by the dragon into the room beyond and investigate further.

I encountered the shade of an enormous dragon outside a pair of doors. The dragon called itself Halatathlaer, and I recognized the name from a journal I found. I told Halatathlaer I killed its mutant offspring and it raged at me but did not attack. The shade must be harmless.~
@50132 = ~My clutch... my precious eggs, lost to me so long ago. I never knew how. Or why...~
@50133 = ~The necromancer responsible for this atrocity must be long dead. But my hatchlings—did you see them? Do they yet live?~
@50134 = ~My poor children... But at least I know they are at peace, and I thank you for that. I am bound by magic and cannot help you while my essence is trapped. Find and free it and I will aid you. Good luck, traveler.~
@50135 = ~Not even a little further? Come on, a few extra feet isn't going to hurt anyone.~
@50136 = ~Who are you that bellows orders at <CHARNAME> in such cavalier fashion?~
@50137 = ~You are Halatathlaer? I found a journal with your name in it not far from here—it mentioned your eggs.~
@50138 = ~Stop! You will go no further. I am Halatathlaer, and I guard the entrance to Kanaglym. There is no passage here but through me, which means there is no passage at all.~ [BD50138]
@50139 = ~There's always a way.~
@50140 = ~Who bid you bar my way?~
@50141 = ~I don't want to fight you, Halatathlaer.~
@50142 = ~You are already a ghost, dragon. Would you die a second, final time? I can arrange that.~
@50143 = ~Who put you here, dragon? Who told you to watch the doors?~ [BD50143]
@50144 = ~I will not say his name.~
@50145 = ~I know ghosts. This one doesn't want to kill us. Bet on that.~ [BD50145]
@50146 = ~You are wise not to. ~
@50147 = ~On whose behalf do you watch over these doors? Your own, or do you serve the will of another?~
@50148 = ~Wise? There's something I'm rarely called.~
@50149 = ~But I will fight you, if you give me no choice.~
@50150 = ~Forgive me, dragon. I misspoke. What I meant was, you don't want to fight ME.~
@50151 = ~With good reason.~
@50152 = ~Begone, <PRO_RACE>. None shall pass through here. All that try shall die.~

@50155 = ~You are prevented from speaking by some mysterious master. You do not do this of your own volition, do you?~
@50156 = ~Cannot? Or will not?~
@50157 = ~Then you will scream it as I slay you.~
@50158 = ~My essence is bound to this task. Beyond me you will find nothing but death. Begone.~
@50159 = ~You say the words, but your tone lacks conviction. Tell me, whose death awaits beyond you? At whose hands?~
@50160 = ~Your essence is bound, you say? By whom? If it were freed, would you help me?~
@50161 = ~I don't suppose there's any wiggle room here, huh?~
@50162 = ~We shall see, specter. We shall see.~
@50163 = ~Doubt it. Can't know for sure without trying.~ [BD50163]
@50164 = ~Do not humor this horrendous half-wit. Her harebrained hypothesis will have us gracing this ghost's guts.~ [BD50164]

@50166 = ~You try my patience, little <PRO_RACE>. Begone!~
@50167 = ~I cannot answer your questions; the power that compels me also silences me. There is nothing here for you but death.~
@50168 = ~This power that compels you, can it be ended? If I free your essence, then would you help me?~
@50169 = ~I must end the evil beyond this door. If that means I must end you as well, I would regret it, but I'll not be turned aside, by you or anyone.~
@50170 = ~That's true of most places I find myself these days, I'm sorry to say.~
@50171 = ~Yes, you've said. Let's test that thesis, shall we?~
@50172 = ~Do what you will, <PRO_RACE>, and face the consequences. ~

@50177 = ~Good? What trickery is this, dragon? What awaits me on the other side of this door?~

@50179 = ~You stand on the threshold of a portal guarded by a dragon's spirit, <CHARNAME>. What makes you think there's ANYTHING good about it?~
@50180 = ~Clearly, nothing good awaits us beyond this threshold. Is this so difficult to grasp?~ [BD50180]
@50181 = ~I did as I was bid, but I'll do no more than that. Your passage will displease my master, which pleases me greatly. Fare thee well in lost Kanaglym.~ [BD50181]

@50183 = ~Kanaglym—I know this name. Are you telling me this is the entrance to the forgotten city of dwarves?~
@50184 = ~Kanaglym? You say this is the door to the forgotten dwarven city—where the fountain of Nepenthe bridges this world and the Fugue Plane?~
@50185 = ~Thanks—? I'll certainly try.~
@50186 = ~What exactly is a Kanaglym, and why am I going into it?~

I should find Tharantis in Bridgefort and tell him of his sister's death.

One of the dead soldiers, a woman named Kendra, has a brother serving here in Bridgefort. I agreed to find Tharantis and inform him of his sister's death.~
@50519 = ~Tender of the Dead

I should ask Junia in Bridgefort if she found a necklace on one of the bodies.

Kendra's brother, Tharantis, asked me to bring him a chain she always wore around her neck. I'd better ask Junia if she saw such a thing.~

I should look for Ymori in the woods around Bridgefort.

I should return to Bridgefort and speak with Junia.

I found Ymori's body mutilated as part of some sort of dark ritual in the woods. When I examined his body, undead rose from the ground. It seems someone laid a trap for me and used Ymori's body as bait. I should talk to Junia again.~
@50532 = ~Tender of the Dead

I should talk to Tharantis again.

I talked to Junia and she explained Ymori was a cultist of Velsharoon. She killed him for it and used his body in a ritual to strengthen the troops. I should tell Tharantis what happened to his sister.~
@50533 = ~Tender of the Dead

I should return to Bridgefort and speak with Junia.

I found Ymori's body mutilated as part of some sort of dark ritual in the woods. When I examined his body, undead rose from the ground. It seems a cleric of Velsharoon, Lord of the Forsaken Crypt, laid a trap for me and used Ymori's body as bait. I should talk to Junia again.~

I returned his sister's necklace to Tharantis. He was grateful for my help. I think the necklace brought him a measure of peace.~

@50619 = ~Greed's hardly the most admirable of motives, but it's understandable and, in this context, at least, serves the greater purpose of impeding Caelar. I see no reason not to keep you in camp.~

@50621 = ~Self-interest is something I understand.~

@50638 = ~All right. I'm not fool enough to kill a fellow soldier. But you've got a sound hiding coming to you, and it looks like I'll be supplyin' it.~
@50639 = ~Yeah, good. Do that.~
@50640 = ~Crusaders. We're lookin' to bash some. Many as we can.~
@50641 = ~I've heard that, but I can't in truth say I believe it. Why are you really here?~

@50647 = ~Why should I tell you anything? ~
@50648 = ~I'm here to help the Bridgefortians and stop the crusade. Anything you can tell me could be helpful.~
@50649 = ~I'm the hero of Baldur's Gate, I'm a Bhaalspawn, and I killed Sarevok. Who better to tell?~

@50653 = ~We share blood, but blood spills more easily than secrets—my secrets, at least.~
@50654 = ~Since you won't stop pushing, here's the deal. You fight me and my friends. Just flats of blades, nothin' lethal. First side gets someone knocked out loses. We lose, I talk. If you lose, you stop talkin'. How's that sound to you?~
@50655 = ~A crude method of discourse, but as it's what you'd apparently prefer, I accept your challenge.~
@50656 = ~Trial by combat, eh? All right. Let's do this.~
@50657 = ~It sounds like a senseless waste of energy. I'll go now.~
@50658 = ~Kava! Farrl! Over here! ~
@50659 = ~Enough! We get the message. We'll leave.~
@50660 = ~We'd have bashed those crusaders good! When you face them, you'll wish we were there beside you.~
@50661 = ~Stop! You have beaten us. I'll talk.~
@50662 = ~All right, all right! You win. I'll tell you what you want to know. Before I met Kava and Farrl, I was one of a hunting party that ran into the crusade. They gave us a choice: Fight for them or run like the hells. I don't run, an' they paid well enough.~
@50663 = ~You were one of their soldiers?~
@50664 = ~We all make poor life choices from time to time.~
@50665 = ~You ARE a spy! ~
@50666 = ~No, listen to me: I want NOTHING more than to tear those crusader into bloody chunks.~
@50667 = ~I applied to be an elite guard to one of the crusade's greatest generals, a half-orc they call the Barghest.~
@50668 = ~The Barghest?~
@50669 = ~What happened then?~
@50670 = ~You wanted to serve the Barghest, and now you've turned upon him. How long will it be before you do the same to us?~
@50671 = ~The Irregulars

I must fight Rend and his allies to earn the half-orc's trust.

The time has come to battle the half-orcs.~
@50672 = ~I've heard of the Barghest. He fought in the Dragonspear Wars—he's a legend in mass bloodshed circles.~
@50673 = ~I thought for sure I'd be selected to serve the Barghest, but he only wanted full-blood orcs. I left camp the next chance I got.~
@50674 = ~Why did you want to serve him so badly?~
@50675 = ~And then what happened?~
@50676 = ~I looked up to the Barghest. He was a powerful warrior, well-respected—how many half-orcs you see in that sorta position? I thought for sure he'd take me into his guard, help another one of the tribe up the ladder. But no. He never gave me a chance.~
@50677 = ~I swore I'd get revenge for him turning me down. When I heard his Blinding White battalion held Boareskyr Bridge, I figured I had a shot.~
@50678 = ~We share the same enemy. Best for all that we fight him together. What can you tell me of the crusade?~
@50679 = ~You need to leave camp immediately. We can't trust an ex-crusader.~
@50680 = ~You served in the crusade. There's but one way I can be certain you won't turn on us, and that's to drive you away... or kill you.~
@50681 = ~So be it. You won't see us here again.~
@50682 = ~Thank you. I was only with 'em a little while. There's two kinds of crusaders: the mercenaries and the true believers. The mercenaries tend to be the better fighters, but the "illuminated" are the dangerous ones. Fanatics, ready—no, HAPPY to die for the cause. Don't underestimate them.~
@50683 = ~That's all you can tell us?~
@50684 = ~Yeah, pretty much. Lieutenant Kharm's the dwarf who trains the Blinding White battalion's new recruits... That help you?~
@50685 = ~It might. Thank you.~
@50686 = ~If I need any combat practice, I'll be sure to look him up.~
@50687 = ~I'm disappointed. I thought you'd be more useful than this.~
@50688 = ~We got things to do now. Maybe we'll talk more later.~
@50689 = ~I'll be plenty useful when it's time to bash some crusaders. Now get outta here, we got things to do.~
@50690 = ~The half-orcs still around?~
@50691 = ~No. I persuaded them to move on.~
@50692 = ~Unfortunately. I tried to get rid of them, but they were too much for me to handle. I'd watch out for that lot.~
@50693 = ~For the moment.~
@50694 = ~Let me know when that changes.~
@50695 = ~Hah! I knew you could do it. Here, take this—it's not much, but me and the others wanted to show our thanks.~
@50696 = ~At least you tried. We'll keep a close eye on them, you can be sure of that.~
@50697 = ~Hey, wait a minute! Farrl and I got into the fort and liberated our loot.~
@50698 = ~Hold a moment, I wanna talk to you. Farrl and I got our loot outta the fort. Here's a little somethin', for helping us out. We're moving on now. Maybe we'll cross paths again some day.~
@50699 = ~Thanks, Kava.~
@50700 = ~This is it? I expected more.~
@50701 = ~I doubt it.~
@50702 = ~Bye!~

@50712 = ~I assume you have an actual point here. Get to it.~
@50713 = ~I have your sister's necklace here, Tharantis.~
@50714 = ~Is it th-that obvious? I have a f-favor to ask of you. Jaheira and I t-told everyone we came north to r-rest. We were actually h-here on Harper business. Even so, I h-hoped we'd have some time to ourselves.~
@50715 = ~You certainly earned it.~
@50716 = ~This is riveting. Really. Do go on.~
@50717 = ~A foolish hope. People like us are rarely allowed a respite.~
@50718 = ~Possibly. I must ask why you'd want me to, though.~
@50719 = ~Our anniversary approaches. I want to give Jaheira a gift, one that shows her h-how much she means to me. C-could you find me silk from a giant spider?~
@50720 = ~Spider's silk isn't very romantic.~
@50721 = ~Something from a giant spider will show Jaheira how much she means to you? I've got to ask, how much DOES she mean to you...?~
@50722 = ~You'd give her spider droppings as a gift? You don't know much about women, do you?~
@50723 = ~Yes, this is Kendra's. I'd know it anywhere. How did you find it?~
@50724 = ~When Jaheira and I met, I'd n-never left the city b-before. Never been out in the wilderness. Jaheira was horrified how little I knew of n-nature. She showed me how to follow animal tracks, identify plants...~
@50725 = ~She showed me a trick for curing s-spider silk. If I can get some, I can turn it into a beautiful, sparkling thread to weave her a necklace f-from.~
@50726 = ~That does sound nice. If I find some giant spider's silk, I'll bring it to you.~
@50727 = ~All right, that doesn't sound nearly as terrible as it did at first. I'll try to track some down for you.~
@50728 = ~In times such as these, we can't afford sentiment. Perhaps I will find some of this silk, but you must promise to focus on the matters at hand before wasting time making trinkets.~
@50729 = ~Th-thank you, my friend. We have to t-t-take the opportunity to show our affection when we can. None of us will live forever.~ [BD50729]
@50730 = ~Currying favor with Jaheira isn't silly in the slightest. She's a formidable woman. Best to stay on her good side whenever possible.~
@50731 = ~Thank you for everything. I'd like to be alone now if you don't mind.~
@50732 = ~Oh, really? I w-wasn't sure you'd... I mean, looking back now, it seems like a s-silly request. ~
@50733 = ~You wanted to give Jaheira a token of affection. I find that admirable.~
@50734 = ~All your requests seem a little silly to me. But who am I to judge?~
@50735 = ~It was. Even so, I did as you asked.~
@50736 = ~W-well, thank you... I'll take the silk, but I don't think I'll m-make a necklace after all.~
@50737 = ~I think you should. It's a nice idea.~
@50738 = ~You've got the silk now. Why not make the necklace?~
@50739 = ~So you wasted my time, then.~
@50740 = ~N-no, no. More important things need doing right now. I thank you, my friend, but I must f-f-focus on the matters at hand.~ [BD50740]

@50746 = ~Ah. You see right th-through me.~
@50747 = ~It was on the body of a murdered man in the woods. I suspect the priestess, Junia, is not telling me everything she knows. I plan to confront her.~

@50749 = ~All that matters is I have it.~
@50750 = ~Anniversary Gift

Khalid refused to pay me for the aquamarine.

It seems Khalid values his gold more than his wife. He refused to pay me for the aquamarine needed to complete the necklace he was creating for Jaheira.~

@50752 = ~Y-you have to understand something about Jaheira. She always knows what she wants and h-how to get it. That intimidated me when we first met. I f-fell in love with her—I w-worshipped her—but I couldn't bring myself to say anything. What could I offer such a woman?~
@50753 = ~There are few things harder than loving someone who doesn't feel the same way.~

@50755 = ~If you lacked the courage to woo her, you didn't deserve her.~
@50756 = ~One day, I learned she'd been wounded on a mission. The healer tried to keep me out of the H-harper safehouse. I kn-knocked him over and rushed in to see her. I blurted out everything. Told her how I really felt. And... she said she felt the same about me...~
@50757 = ~If it'll make Jaheira happy? Of course. Here, take it.~
@50758 = ~She's a hard person to r-read at times. I wasn't sure if she'd like the necklace—I'm still not. But it—it's better to take a chance than hide my feelings.~

@50760 = ~She liked you well enough to marry you. I'm sure she'll like whatever gift you give her.~
@50761 = ~Finally, you grasp the obvious. Better to be bold and risk failure than fail having not taken the risk at all.~
@50762 = ~I've started work on the necklace. All I need now is a precious s-stone to set in it. Jaheira's favorite is aquamarine. ~
@50763 = ~I'll find an aquamarine for you, friend.~

@50770 = ~Perhaps. I need to think about it.~

@50772 = ~No, of course not. I was just teasing you. Here's the gem.~

I confronted Junia, who confessed to her deeds. She ordered her undead servants to attack, but they were no match for me.~

@50792 = ~The effort may have been ill-conceived, but the sentiment is admirable, surely?~
@50793 = ~I agree. It was impractical of him.~

@50878 = ~What's in it for me?~
@50879 = ~You always get some leeches in camps, but this one's had more than its share. Some of my men say they've been asked to steal from dead soldiers and pawn their scavengings through a black market. I won't have that sort of business going on here!~ [BD50879]
@50880 = ~I've also heard reports of our more clandestine soldiers—the ones we recruit for subtle tactics and intelligence—being approached or even attacked.~
@50881 = ~The guild will pressure the soldiers to do what they ask and make an example of those who won't. Not an uncommon practice.~ [BD50881]
@50882 = ~You're new here, so the guild probably hasn't gotten to you yet. You may be a black-hearted villain, but people say you're here to help. Can you take care of this?~ [BD50882]
@50883 = ~How shall I track these thieves down?~
@50884 = ~And if I do take care of your problem, what's in it for me?~

@50887 = ~You're certain this is happening? A thieves' guild is being formed?~
@50888 = ~What's in it for me?~
@50889 = ~All right, I'll return when I've discovered more about this guild.~
@50890 = ~I may be a dwarf, but I'm no skinflint. How does 500 gold pieces sound?~ [BD50890]

@50893 = ~All right, I'll return when I've discovered more about this guild.~
@50894 = ~Well, don't go announcing your mission to the whole camp. Keep it under your hood, eh? Now, get moving!~ [BD50894]
@50895 = ~That's disappointing, if not surprising. Perhaps killing the thieves will have sent a message to their leader. Let us hope.~
@50896 = ~Let me know the minute you learn anything.~

@50898 = ~I only saw one, their leader. I leaned on her and she agreed to stop the thieving and come to our aid with her guild when battle starts.~
@50899 = ~I wish I could tell you, but once I put some pressure on the leader she took to her heels. We won't be troubled by the guild anymore.~
@50900 = ~The look of utter terror on their leader's face as she faced me is one I'm well used to.~
@50901 = ~Good work! We'll put those jackals to good use in the battle. March 'em up front, eh? Here's something extra for doing such a good job.~ [BD50901]
@50902 = ~Nederlok needs to know about this. All the commanders do.~
@50903 = ~Not the perfect outcome, but a decent one. I'm grateful for your help, and the gratitude of a dwarf lasts longer than the mountains.~ [BD50903]
@50904 = ~Perhaps. What would you have me do?~
@50905 = ~If you make it worth my time.~
@50906 = ~Solve your own problems, de Lancie.~
@50907 = ~Now, what's the price we agreed on? 300 gold, was it?~ [BD50907]
@50908 = ~It was 500, general.~
@50909 = ~It was 500, but 300 will do.~
@50910 = ~Three THOUSAND I think you mean.~
@50911 = ~I believe you're right. Here you are, hero. Now, get moving. We've got a war to win!~ [BD50911]
@50912 = ~Very well.~
@50913 = ~What do I get out of the deal?~
@50914 = ~I'm not your lackey. Deal with Gramorn yourself.~
@50915 = ~You're not half bad, you know that? I'll admit the militia can use every coin we can hoard. Daggerford hasn't got the coffers to match Waterdeep's. Here you are, hero. Now get moving, we've got a war to win!~
@50916 = ~The other commanders need to know what happened. Gramorn's followers could have extorted their troops.~
@50917 = ~I'll keep silent. And Gramorn won't be in a position to talk with anyone shortly.~
@50918 = ~You're not half bad, you know that? I'll admit the militia can use every coin we can hoard. Daggerford hasn't got the coffers to match Waterdeep's. Here you are, hero. Now, get moving. We've got a war to win!~ [BD50918]
@50919 = ~Agreed. I'll return when Gramorn is dead.~
@50920 = ~No promises. We can revisit the matter after I've dealt with Gramorn.~
@50921 = ~I'm not an assassin. Gramorn's your problem; I suggest you handle it, and quickly.~
@50922 = ~Get to it, then. Here's what I promised you for rooting the conspiracy out. I'll await your return here.~
@50923 = ~Ha! I like your spirit. Here you are, hero, 500 gold. Now get moving, we've got a war to win!~
@50924 = ~Ha! I like your spirit. Here you are, hero, 500 gold. Now, get moving. We've got a war to win!~ [BD50924]
@50925 = ~As you wish. Here's what you were promised for rooting out the thieves' guild. I'll await your return here.~
@50926 = ~Hurry, then. We can't let Gramorn get away.~
@50927 = ~Good. Reinss was a friend once. He turned his back on that when he betrayed Waterdeep.~
@50928 = ~He made his choice. Justice has been served.~
@50929 = ~Tell it to your biographer. I just want to get paid.~
@50930 = ~He tried to put up a fight. It was his last mistake.~
@50931 = ~Here's a reward for dealing with Gramorn. I need to attend to more important matters now. We'll speak later.~
@50932 = ~There's something we need to talk about. I paid you a tidy sum to keep this matter quiet, but I understand you revealed all to another commander.~
@50933 = ~What happened was too important. I couldn't leave an ally in the dark.~
@50934 = ~You paid a tidy sum, it's true—but the one they offered was tidier still.~
@50935 = ~You don't control me, with money or otherwise. I changed my mind, simple as that.~
@50936 = ~Damn it! I should know better than to trust the "hero" of that gods damned pirate den you call a city. I'll be keeping the reward I offered for killing Gramorn. You're not the only one who can break their word.~
@50937 = ~I knew had to come to you right away with this information, sir.~
@50938 = ~Does de Lancie know about this?~
@50939 = ~Yes. The matter is being handled.~
@50940 = ~Yes, but you may want to talk to your people. It's possible Gramorn threatened or coerced them.~
@50941 = ~He does. And he'd rather you NOT know about it.~
@50942 = ~Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I'll make some quiet inquiries to ensure our forces haven't been compromised.~
@50943 = ~De Lancie WOULD be more concerned for his reputation than the camp. Here, take this along with my thanks for bringing the matter to my attention.~
@50944 = ~Gramorn's one of de Lancie's men, ain't he? I'll skin him alive!~
@50945 = ~He was one of de Lancie's men, yes. The Torsin asked me to handle the matter.~
@50946 = ~Gramorn might have approached your soldiers too. He's been making threats and extorting money for I know not how long.~
@50947 = ~As you wish, but do me a favor and keep this between us. De Lancie asked me not to tell you about it.~
@50948 = ~Tell de Lancie he'd BETTER get this settled, else I'll be by to give him the Hells. All nine of 'em! ~
@50949 = ~Just the sort of thing I'd expect that slithering snake to do. You're a straight arrow, though. Here, take this, and my thanks.~
@50950 = ~Did you need something, young one? ~
@50951 = ~What is it you're doing here? If you don't mind my asking.~
@50952 = ~Not as young as I look, ma'am.~
@50953 = ~Not right now.~
@50954 = ~Ah, yes. It can be hard to tell with elves.~
@50955 = ~May I ask what you're doing here?~
@50956 = ~I need to be going.~
@50957 = ~Consulting on tactical movements and troop deployments. I've been retired for years, but my mind's still sharp.~ [BD50957]
@50958 = ~Clearly. What did you do before you retired?~
@50959 = ~I need to be going.~
@50960 = ~I was a warden in the Waterdeep City Guard. I joined at eighteen and served over thirty years.~
@50961 = ~Three decades—you earned your retirement. Yet here you are, right in the thick of things.~
@50962 = ~So the crusade forced you out of retirement? That must be irritating.~
@50963 = ~Very interesting, but I need to be going.~
@50964 = ~I don't mind helping plan strategy—I enjoy it, actually. I won't be seeing any action myself, though. My fighting days are well behind me now.~
@50965 = ~Bide a moment, please. I've something to ask you.~
@50966 = ~You're the one everyone's talking about—the hero of Baldur's Gate. You've seen many battles. What do you think of war?~ [BD50966]
@50967 = ~It's a terrible thing, to be avoided at all costs.~
@50968 = ~As long as men and women strive to control the lives of others, war is inevitable. And the desire to control others is not something I see ending any time soon.~
@50969 = ~Sometimes war is needed to create change in the world.~
@50970 = ~War in service to a worthy cause is a glorious thing. There can be no greater purpose than to take up arms against the legions of evil.~
@50971 = ~War. War never changes.~
@50972 = ~Sometimes a war is needed, but most conflicts work themselves out in time. As a general rule, shorter-lived races are too quick to jump into battle.~
@50973 = ~Battle separates the strong and honorable from the weak and cowardly. War is a great thing.~
@50974 = ~The benefits of war must be weighed against the toll it takes in its victims' suffering.~
@50975 = ~It is a great thing to see my enemies lying dead at my feet.~
@50976 = ~War, yeah. What is it good for? Absolutely nothing.~
@50977 = ~An interesting perspective. Have you heard the expression "know your enemy"? Some believe learning all you can about your foe gives you an edge. But I think it's just as important to understand the minds and motivations of those one will fight beside.~
@50978 = ~Why don't you talk to some of the people in the camp? Find out why they're here, what they're fighting for. Then come tell me if you've learned anything.~ [BD50978]
@50979 = ~I'm sorry, I don't have time to talk. We're awfully busy here. ~
@50980 = ~Is there anything I can do to help?~
@50981 = ~Tell me, Dosia, why are you here? You could have stayed in your temple and done Ilmater's work from there, couldn't you?~
@50982 = ~Then why do it? Why join the coalition instead of doing Ilmater's work another way?~
@50983 = ~You can make time to talk to the hero of Baldur's Gate, I'm sure.~
@50984 = ~Tell me who you are and what's going on. Now.~
@50985 = ~I'll be going, then.~
@50986 = ~My triage is full of very sick patients. I can't waste time talking until they're restored, I'm sorry. ~
@50987 = ~I've neither the time nor the inclination to speak to you on that matter, or any other at the moment. Excuse me.~
@50988 = ~Why do you want to know? ~
@50989 = ~Warden Twoedged suggested I learn why the various members of our coalition fight together.~
@50990 = ~I want to understand what it is that brings people together in these dark times.~
@50991 = ~I'm just curious.~
@50992 = ~Ja! Speak to us, dear priestess. Knowing what drives such a beautiful maiden will lend old Voghiln the strength to go forward with this campaign.~ [BD50992]
@50993 = ~Persistence can be admirable trait, skald, but the impulses behind your tenacity are as obvious as they are wearisome.~
@50994 = ~You'll have to ask someone else. I simply have too much to do right now. Excuse me.~

@50996 = ~I first served as a field medic in the first War of Dragonspear. Devils from the castle attacked Daggerford. Hordes of the foul creatures overran my home. They were everywhere. The wounds they inflicted... I see them still, in my nightmares.~

@51002 = ~It sounds like an ordeal.~
@51003 = ~Thank you for telling me about yourself.~
@51004 = ~Yes. There'd been a battle at Dragonspear some years before. It took the combined forces of Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate to retake the castle. ~
@51005 = ~You said fiends came from the castle and went all the way to Daggerford?~
@51006 = ~What a terrible event.~
@51007 = ~Nothing's ever been worse than that day. People I'd known my whole life were torn to pieces right in front of me. ~
@51008 = ~People I'd known my whole life were torn to pieces before my eyes. I called on Ilmater until my throat was hoarse and my power drained. Somehow I survived, and even kept a few others alive.~
@51009 = ~You honored yourself and your god, Dosia. I thank you for your service.~
@51010 = ~And now you are here to fight the forces of Dragonspear once again. The coalition is in your debt.~
@51011 = ~You're welcome. It's funny; I joined Daggerford's militia years ago to support the townsfolk. Now that we're here at the castle, I feel like this—this is my fate. I must return to my duties now. Take care.~
@51012 = ~I have to return to my duties now. Take care of yourself.~
@51013 = ~What a bunch of pathetic babies! I've never seen a worse lot in my entire career! ~ [BD48454]
@51014 = ~Troubles, Vigilant?~
@51015 = ~If you have a minute, I'd like to ask you about why you joined this alliance.~
@51016 = ~They're pretty terrible.~
@51017 = ~Incompetents like this will cause more deaths to their own side than to the enemy.~
@51018 = ~Good luck with them, Vigilant.~
@51019 = ~Battle needs to be fought. I'm a soldier. What more is there to it?~ [BD51019]
@51020 = ~Warden Twoedged suggested I learn more about my allies. Did you request this assignment or were you ordered here?~
@51021 = ~That's what I'm trying to find out. Did you want to come here?~
@51022 = ~It almost sounds like you're happy to be involved in this campaign.~
@51023 = ~I'm cutting heads off a hydra with a butter knife here. I don't have time for this trivial nonsense. Dismissed!~
@51024 = ~I volunteered for the assignment. Can't see what difference it makes.~
@51025 = ~Why we fight is as important as how we fight. Sometimes, it is even more important.~ [BD51025]
@51026 = ~Unless you care about staying alive. In which case, it's ALL about how you fight.~ [BD51026]
@51027 = ~Look, this isn't my first campaign. It isn't my second either, or fifth, or tenth. I may only be a vigilant, but I've seen plenty of battles.~
@51028 = ~Why did you ask to be in this one?~
@51029 = ~How is it you haven't been promoted by now?~
@51030 = ~What do you expect the battle to be like?~
@51031 = ~Because I love my city.~
@51032 = ~If you've been in so many battles, how is it that you haven't been promoted?~
@51033 = ~What do you expect the battle to be like?~
@51034 = ~A noble effort, but a doomed one.~
@51035 = ~You know what vigilants do? They talk to their troops. They secure provisions and monitor morale. They keep soldiers alive.~
@51036 = ~You know what commanders do? They move wooden soldiers around on maps. Vigilants? We talk to the troops. We secure provisions and monitor morale. We keep soldiers alive.~ [BD51036]
@51037 = ~And you are to be commended for it.~
@51038 = ~Can I ask what you think the battle will be like?~
@51039 = ~Thank you for answering my questions.~
@51040 = ~Bloody. Trained soldiers against mercenaries and fanatics? It won't be an easy fight. We'll lose a lot of good people.~
@51041 = ~We'll lose fewer, thanks to your efforts.~
@51042 = ~You sound experienced. How come you haven't been promoted?~
@51043 = ~Thank you for answering my questions.~
@51044 = ~Some learn to fight as a matter of survival. I do what I do to help others survive. But it's never enough.~
@51045 = ~Even if every fighter the coalition has survives, the crusaders will still die. Some of them—most of them, maybe—are good people. Hells, some of them are friends.~
@51046 = ~You have a friend in the enemy camp?~
@51047 = ~They chose to join the crusade. We can't do anything about that.~
@51048 = ~If they're part of the crusade, they deserve to die.~
@51049 = ~Every soldier is s-someone's friend. Someone's ch-child.~
@51050 = ~Or someone's parent.~
@51051 = ~Tristian was my closest friend 'til I moved to Waterdeep. We kept in touch. His mother wrote me when he joined the crusade. Asked me to find him, to send him home. I can't, though. My people come first. They have to.~
@51052 = ~Asked me if I could do what I could to send him home. I can't, though. I can only think of my own soldiers. I have to.~
@51053 = ~Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to these drills. Dismissed.~
@51054 = ~Their fates were sealed when they threw their lot in with the Shining Lady, but we don't have to hate them. They fight for what they believe, same as we do. Now excuse me, I've got to get back to these drills. Dismissed.~
@51055 = ~There's a lot of work goes in to preparing a camp this size. You'll have to be quick about whatever you want. ~
@51056 = ~I'm in need of supplies.~
@51057 = ~Could I ask you something? Is this the first big battle you've ever supplied?~
@51058 = ~I'll come back another time.~
@51059 = ~As you like.~
@51060 = ~I'm only here to supply the troops. What do you need?~
@51061 = ~Oh, certainly. Let me just drop everything I'm doing for the coalition and chat with you. ~
@51062 = ~Thanks, I appreciate it.~
@51063 = ~Your sarcasm is hardly noticeable at all.~
@51064 = ~Now you're wasting MY time.~
@51065 = ~I was being sarcastic, you ninny.~
@51066 = ~You do realize I'm the busiest person in this camp, don't you? I've no time for idle chatter.~
@51067 = ~Warden Twoedged believes I should learn more of those who fight the Shining Lady. I'll not take much of your time, I promise.~
@51068 = ~I'll make it quick. I just want to understand everyone's reasons for being here.~
@51069 = ~The sooner you talk to me, the sooner I'll go away.~
@51070 = ~Nope. Nope, can't do it. Come back when things calm down. Say, this time next year, give or take a tenday.~
@51071 = ~Fine. If it'll get you out of my hair, ask your questions.~
@51072 = ~Fine, fine. Since you're an elf, I suppose I can give you a few seconds.~
@51073 = ~Fine. I suppose since you're a half-elf I can spare a few minutes.~
@51074 = ~What do you want to know? Quickly!~
@51075 = ~You said you were the busiest person in camp?~
@51076 = ~What made you join this coalition?~
@51077 = ~Is this the biggest battle you've ever supplied?~
@51078 = ~You doubt it? Troops need weapons. They need food, fresh water, clothes, warm boots, blankets, and bedrolls! This expeditition wouldn't have made it a mile outside of Baldur's Gate without me.~
@51079 = ~What made you join this effort? Did you volunteer, or were you ordered to come?~
@51080 = ~Is this the biggest battle you've ever supplied?~
@51081 = ~Thank you for answering my questions.~
@51082 = ~I've supplied small Flaming Fist engagements before and I'm a proud citizen of Baldur's Gate. When they REQUESTED I come along, I agreed readily enough.~
@51083 = ~And you're quite busy?~
@51084 = ~Is this the biggest battle you've ever supplied?~
@51085 = ~Thank you for answering my questions.~
@51086 = ~By far. The amount of organizing I have to do to keep this operation running is staggering. I can't imagine how the previous armies did it.~
@51087 = ~By far. The organization it takes to keep this operation running is staggering. I can't imagine how they managed it during the last Dragonspear Wars.~
@51088 = ~You said you were one of the busiest people in camp?~
@51089 = ~What made you join this coalition?~
@51090 = ~Thank you for answering my questions.~
@51091 = ~Eh. It's nice to talk about something other than how many bedbugs per roll is considered acceptable. If I had time, I'd tell you about the last Dragonspear War. Fiends spewing forth from the castle! Waterdeep's City Guard and Flaming Fist fighting shoulder to shoulder!~
@51092 = ~They were battles to go down in history. Fiends spewing forth from the castle! Waterdeep City Guard and Flaming Fist fighting shoulder to shoulder!~
@51093 = ~Then a second time the devils poured out, rampaging all the way to Daggerford! I'm a bit of a history buff. Maybe I'll get to help make some on this venture. Now I have to get back to work. Luck to you.~
@51094 = ~Now I have to get back to work. This army isn't going to supply itself!~
@51095 = ~Did you need something, young one? ~
@51096 = ~Can I ask what you're doing here?~
@51097 = ~I've been talking to people around the camp, as you suggested.~
@51098 = ~Not as young as I look, ma'am.~
@51099 = ~Not right now.~
@51100 = ~Ah yes. It's hard to tell with elves. ~
@51101 = ~Can I ask what you're doing here?~
@51102 = ~I've been talking to people around the camp.~
@51103 = ~I need to be going.~
@51104 = ~Helping plan tactical movements and troop deployments. I've been retired for some years now, but my mind remains sharp.~
@51105 = ~I took your suggestion, ma'am. I talked to other people in the camp.~
@51106 = ~I'll leave you to it.~
@51107 = ~Ah, I see. And so you've returned with your report.~
@51108 = ~You've not been gone long. Come speak to me after you try talking to a few more people.~
@51109 = ~You haven't been gone long, though. Try speaking to at least one more person before returning to me.~
@51110 = ~I'm glad to hear it. Tell me, what have you learned of your allies?~
@51111 = ~Everyone has their own reason to be part of this effort, and each reason is valid in its own way.~
@51112 = ~Some people are here for professional reasons, others out of duty or curiosity. There's no consensus.~
@51113 = ~People tell themselves stories to lend reason to their actions. They don't truly understand why they're here.~
@51114 = ~Not everyone would talk to me. Maybe they're ashamed to admit why they're here.~
@51115 = ~I'm not sure people were honest with me. I wonder if they trust me.~
@51116 = ~I'm glad you took my request seriously. Finding out about your allies helps you understand them. It might also help you understand yourself. Here, take this old medal of mine. I had it enchanted at one point. You'll have more use for it than I, I am certain.~ [BD51116]
@51117 = ~I'm proud of you for taking my request seriously. Here, take this old medal of mine. I had it enchanted at one point and I no longer need it. ~
@51118 = ~Carry on, then. ~
@51119 = ~Greetings, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. In the market for a new weapon? Or perhaps a potion? ~
@51120 = ~Let me see what you have.~
@51121 = ~I'm looking for something out of the ordinary.~
@51122 = ~I heard you were a fence for the camp's thieves' guild.~
@51123 = ~Have you heard about the sickness going around camp? I've a cure for it. I'm looking for a buyer.~
@51124 = ~Nothing today, thank you.~
@51125 = ~You look as though you might be interested in some of my special wares. They are quite out of the ordinary. Very difficult to obtain.~
@51126 = ~Just your regular wares, please.~
@51127 = ~Are you talking about stolen goods?~
@51128 = ~Those do sound interesting. What do you have?~
@51129 = ~Stolen? Is it stealing when an army cuts off an enemy's supply lines? It makes it harder for the adversary, breaks their morale—it might even bring a quicker end to the conflict.~
@51130 = ~You're not cutting supply lines, though. You're talking about items stolen from the crusaders, aren't you?~
@51131 = ~Stealing is a crime. Even our enemies don't deserve to have their personal items taken. I should report you.~
@51132 = ~A fair point. What have you got?~
@51133 = ~I've no interest in your wares right now.~
@51134 = ~Perhaps... but it's still true that a dispirited soldier doesn't fight as well. I'm simply doing my part to help end this quagmire.~
@51135 = ~Theft is a vile crime. Even enemies don't deserve to have their personal items stolen. I should report you to the commanders.~
@51136 = ~Fair enough. What do you have available?~
@51137 = ~I'm not interested in your wares right now.~
@51138 = ~Sadly, I've only a few minor items in stock right now. I sell mundane items crusaders... misplaced, as mementos for our own soldiers.~
@51139 = ~I've s-seen this before—soldiers taking t-trophies to commemorate battle.~
@51140 = ~A distasteful practice. We should have no part of this.~
@51141 = ~There are items I want to get my hands on, but they're proving difficult to obtain. Everyone says you can do the impossible. Interested in making some quick coin?~
@51142 = ~Absolutely. What are you looking for?~
@51143 = ~I might be. Tell me more.~
@51144 = ~In the manner you suggest? No.~
@51145 = ~Look at you getting into the spirit of things. This should be fun.~ [BD51145]
@51146 = ~I'm looking for five things: a ring, a battle standard, a token of faith, a map, and a holy symbol.~
@51147 = ~Tell me about the ring.~
@51148 = ~Any particular battle standard?~
@51149 = ~What's this "token of faith"?~
@51150 = ~Any map?~
@51151 = ~A holy symbol different from the token of faith?~
@51152 = ~A crusader commander named Dreon wears a signet ring stamped with Caelar's seal. He's notoriously hard to talk to, but maybe you can figure out a way. ~
@51153 = ~I have a question about another item.~
@51154 = ~I'll return when I have what you're looking for.~
@51155 = ~One of the chests in camp reportedly holds a stack of crusade battle standards. I only need one. Too many will devalue their worth. ~
@51156 = ~I have a question about another item.~
@51157 = ~I'll be back when I find what you're looking for.~
@51158 = ~Some new crusaders have taken to making coins into charms, as a show of their faith in the Shining Lady. One of them must carry such an item around.~
@51159 = ~I have a question about another item.~
@51160 = ~I'll be back when I find what you're looking for.~
@51161 = ~If it were any map, I could get it myself. What I want is a map that charts the crusade's progress along the Sword Coast, annotated by Caelar herself. It hangs somewhere in the crusader camp.~
@51162 = ~I have a question about another item.~
@51163 = ~I'll be back when I find what you're looking for.~
@51164 = ~Indeed. It's a symbol of Red Knight. Looks like a knight chesspiece, but with rubies for eyes! One of the crusade's clerics wears it.~
@51165 = ~I have a question about another item.~
@51166 = ~I'll be back when I find what you're looking for.~
@51167 = ~Well, aren't you the righteous one? Never mind, then. I'll find another way to get what I want.~
@51168 = ~Come back if you change your mind.~
@51169 = ~Bring me what you can when you can. I'll be here.~
@51170 = ~I think you'll be happy with my selection.~
@51171 = ~You again. Didn't think you'd be back here to bother me. ~
@51172 = ~I did what was best for the camp. I make no apologies.~
@51173 = ~I have no quarrel with you. Our dealings weren't personal.~
@51174 = ~I didn't either. But here I am.~
@51175 = ~To be honest the guild was keeping down my profits. I'm fine with putting the past behind us. Did you want to buy something? ~
@51176 = ~Let me see what you have.~
@51177 = ~Nothing today, thank you.~
@51178 = ~I don't talk to recruits. ~
@51179 = ~But I—~
@51180 = ~Can't you make time for your old friend Sallo?~
@51181 = ~Dismissed.~
@51182 = ~You're the one who brought me my wine, aren't you? I recognize you now. Well, what is it?~
@51183 = ~I've a number of reports here requiring your seal.~
@51184 = ~I was wondering if I could borrow your ring. One good turn deserves another, as they say.~
@51185 = ~I don't have time for this. A number of reports, you say?~
@51186 = ~Stacks, sir. If you like, I could borrow your ring and mark them all for you. ~
@51187 = ~I know you're a busy man. Why don't you lend me your ring and I'll mark them for you?~
@51188 = ~It's not pressing. I'll come back later.~
@51189 = ~Yes, fine. Here, take it. I'll need it back by end of day.~
@51190 = ~I understand. Thank you.~
@51191 = ~You have my word.~
@51192 = ~I'll be careful with it.~
@51193 = ~You should not give your word if you do not intend to keep it.~ [BD51193]
@51194 = ~I can't just let you take my ring. It's for official business only.~
@51195 = ~My business IS official. Did I not bring you your wine and the report? You know I'm trustworthy.~
@51196 = ~Mine is a mission of utmost importance, sir. I have reports that, once sealed, go straight to the Shining Lady's hands. Many died for this information—these reports have been written in the blood of noble crusaders! Would you sacrifice their lives for nothing?~
@51197 = ~If you won't give me the ring, I'll have to take it by force.~
@51198 = ~Are you mad?~
@51199 = ~I said no. Don't ask me again.~
@51200 = ~Get away from that chest!~
@51201 = ~Hey! Leave that alone!~
@51202 = ~That doesn't belong to you.~
@51203 = ~What do you think you're doing?~
@51204 = ~Praise be to the Lord of Battles! ~
@51205 = ~As a priestess, you would know much about different religions, correct? Their holy symbols, for instance?~
@51206 = ~The Lord of Battles?~
@51207 = ~Praise be indeed! Do you have any healing or potions for sale?~
@51208 = ~I need to go.~
@51209 = ~I have some knowledge, yes, but I am no scholar. There is a tiresome priest in the triage camp who I expect would know far more than I.~
@51210 = ~I seek information about the Red Knight.~
@51211 = ~I need to trick a cleric of the Red Knight into relinquishing his holy symbol.~
@51212 = ~She seems too busy to help me. I'll figure things out myself.~
@51213 = ~The Knight is an ally of Tempus. What are you up to? ~
@51214 = ~I need to trick a follower of the Red Knight out of his holy symbol.~
@51215 = ~Never mind. I'll figure things out myself.~
@51216 = ~Blasphemy! The Red Knight is an honorable god concerned with tactics and strategy. Bother that priest and you'll answer to me.~
@51217 = ~My cause is righteous. The priest uses the Red Knight's blessings on the crusade's behalf. He must be stopped.~
@51218 = ~The Red Knight holds sway over strategy. If we can successfully wrest away the priest's holy symbol, he doesn't deserve to keep it.~
@51219 = ~The coalition needs that symbol. I can tell you nothing more, but believe me when I say it's of utmost importance I acquire it.~
@51220 = ~You disappoint me, priest. I'll deal with this on my own.~
@51221 = ~You've got me there. I'll help as best I can. As I said before, Red Knight is a tactical god. Her followers play a lot of games.~
@51222 = ~Very well. I'll help as best I can. Let's see now. The Red Knight's worshippers play many games... Here, I have a board for Coroniir, a game the elves invented. Challenge the priest. Get him to wager his holy symbol.~ [BD51222]
@51223 = ~How can I be sure to win?~
@51224 = ~Thank you, Mizhena.~
@51225 = ~A weak plan, but I will make do.~
@51226 = ~The same as when you are in battle: with honor and superior skill.~
@51227 = ~Get on with it, then. And see to it you bring my board back when you're done.~
@51228 = ~Treachery and deceit! Such tactics are beneath the Lord of Battles, as they are beneath me. Begone from my sight!~
@51229 = ~As you wish. Tempus walk with you.~
@51230 = ~Knight Commander Tristian, at your service. May the Lady of Strategy bring you victory.~ [BD51230]
@51231 = ~And you as well.~
@51232 = ~The Lady of Strategy is the Red Knight, correct?~
@51233 = ~Tristian, you say? Do you know a vigilant of Waterdeep named Halasan?~
@51234 = ~May she bring victory to us all.~
@51235 = ~I need no god's blessing to achieve victory.~
@51236 = ~Your pardon. I have duties to attend to.~ [BD51236]
@51237 = ~Why do you ask that? Is Halasan here?~ [BD51237]
@51238 = ~I heard someone by that name is stationed in the enemy camp.~
@51239 = ~She's in my camp, south of here.~
@51240 = ~So you do know her.~
@51241 = ~YOUR camp? That means you're not... Guards! Intruder!~ [BD51241]
@51242 = ~Aloisa Halasan and I grew up together. I knew there was a chance she'd be here, but... I'd hoped she wouldn't be.~ [BD51242]
@51243 = ~Perhaps you should go to her. Try talking with her before you're forced into battle.~
@51244 = ~What will happen if you meet her in combat?~
@51245 = ~If hopes were dragons, we'd all be cinders. If you don't want to meet her in the battlefield, leave this place now.~
@51246 = ~No. I cannot abandon my post, and it would solve nothing. The Shining Lady's cause is righteous. Nothing else matters.~ [BD51246]
@51247 = ~She will fight as best she's able, as will I. We made our choices.~ [BD51247]
@51248 = ~I'd appreciate you not mentioning this again. Is there something else I can help you with?~ [BD51248]
@51249 = ~You mentioned the Lady of Strategy. That refers to the Red Knight, doesn't it?~
@51250 = ~Nothing at the moment.~
@51251 = ~Correct. The Red Knight gifts us with tactical knowledge in battle.~ [BD51251]
@51252 = ~Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I've heard you carry an exquisitely crafted holy symbol.~
@51253 = ~Tactical knowledge, you say? Then I challenge you to a game of strategy.~
@51254 = ~That's all I wanted to know.~
@51255 = ~You heard of that? Well, it is true. The symbol is very special to me, a gift an old friend gave me when I joined the church.~ [BD51255]
@51256 = ~How confident are you in the Red Knight's favor? Would you wager the symbol in a game of strategy?~
@51257 = ~I challenge you to a battle of wits and tactics!~
@51258 = ~In the Grandmaster of the Lanceboard's name, I challenge you to a contest.~
@51259 = ~That's all I wanted to know. Thank you.~
@51260 = ~Why would I accept such a challenge?~ [BD51260]
@51261 = ~I have a Coroniir board here, one of the finest tactical games ever designed. How better to learn its intricacies than playing against a devotee of the Red Knight?~
@51262 = ~If you don't, your gutlessness and lack of faith will be exposed for all to see.~
@51263 = ~To pass the time? It's boring waiting for a battle to start.~
@51264 = ~And what are the stakes should I accept this challenge?~ [BD51264]
@51265 = ~Your holy symbol against 100 gold pieces.~
@51266 = ~Your holy symbol against 200 gold pieces.~
@51267 = ~Your holy symbol against my reputation.~
@51268 = ~Ridiculous. I'll not risk my most treasured possession, though I hardly think I'd be in danger of losing it to you.~ [BD51268]
@51269 = ~Your holy symbol against 200 gold pieces, then.~
@51270 = ~I'll return when I have more money to wager.~
@51271 = ~Were we not at war, I might accept your challenge. I'll not waste time on frivolities in the midst of conflict.~ [BD51271]
@51272 = ~Set up the board. Who am I playing against?~ [BD51272]
@51273 = ~Myself.~
@51274 = ~Dynaheir.~
@51275 = ~Edwin.~
@51276 = ~Neera.~
@51277 = ~Thy game seems simple extraordinaire.~ [BD51277]
@51278 = ~Must I waste my time on children's games?~
@51279 = ~You trust me with this? Thanks!~
@51280 = ~Let's begin.~ [BD51280]
@51281 = ~Let's begin.~
@51282 = ~You've bested me. The Red Knight has taught me a harsh lesson this day. Here, the holy symbol is yours.~ [BD51282]
@51283 = ~Thank you.~
@51284 = ~You were pretty good. I was just better.~
@51285 = ~The Red Knight? She taught you nothing, fool. Whatever lesson you take from this came from my hand, no other's.~
@51286 = ~You've lost the match. My thanks for the gold. The church will put it to good use.~ [BD51286]
@51287 = ~The Red Knight has found a worthy disciple in you, my friend. How about a rematch?~
@51288 = ~I think you cheated.~
@51289 = ~So be it.~
@51290 = ~Same stakes?~ [BD51290]
@51291 = ~Yes.~
@51292 = ~I'll return when I have some money to wager.~
@51293 = ~I'll pretend I didn't hear that. Be off with you now. I've duties to attend to, even if you don't.~ [BD51293]
@51294 = ~Good day to you. ~
@51295 = ~Don't touch the map! It belongs to the Shining Lady. The notes upon it were written by her own hand.~
@51296 = ~My apologies. I didn't realize.~
@51297 = ~I'm taking this map whether you like it or not.~
@51298 = ~Help! Thieves!~
@51299 = ~Glory to the crusade.~
@51300 = ~All's well, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! ~
@51301 = ~You don't disappoint. What do you have?~
@51302 = ~I found the ring.~
@51303 = ~I found the battle standard.~
@51304 = ~I found the holy symbol.~
@51305 = ~I found the token of faith.~
@51306 = ~I found the map annotated by Caelar.~
@51307 = ~I might have good news soon. I'll return shortly.~
@51308 = ~What more do you want? I've brought you everything you asked for.~
@51309 = ~Ah, excellent! Yes, this is it. Exactly what I wanted!~
@51310 = ~As promised, a fine reward. ~
@51311 = ~Anything else for me?~
@51312 = ~Anything else? I've brought you all that you asked for, have I not?~
@51313 = ~Not at the moment.~
@51314 = ~You're doing great so far. Keep it up.~
@51315 = ~So you have. I can't honestly say I expected you to come through on all of it! Here, take a little something on top of everything else for being so thorough.~
@51316 = ~Halt! Who goes there?~ [BD51316]
@51317 = ~It's just me, <CHARNAME>.~
@51318 = ~Aren't you supposed to say that to people OUTSIDE the barricade?~
@51319 = ~Watch your tone. I go where I please.~
@51320 = ~Ah, sorry, ha ha! A little drink yesterday evenin' turned into a lot of drinks early this mornin'. I'm, uh... I'm not in the best shape right now.~ [BD51320]
@51321 = ~You look to me like someone dealing with more than a hangover. Is something wrong?~
@51322 = ~You're alive. If you'd like to stay that way, you'd best pull yourself together when on duty.~
@51323 = ~Carry on, then.~
@51324 = ~Aye, but I don't want to waste your time with my sorrows. I know you're an important person.~ [BD51324]
@51325 = ~You can tell me. What is it?~
@51326 = ~I like to make time for the ordinary people in my important life. What's your trouble?~
@51327 = ~I asked you a question, dwarf. Answer me.~
@51328 = ~It's—ach, this is gonna sound so, so... Ah, hells. It's me lucky charm, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. A pebble from Mithral Hall. I lost it somewhere on the march here.~ [BD51328]
@51329 = ~S-soldiers often carry such tokens—trinkets they b-believe grant them g-good fortune.~
@51330 = ~I've had the most terrible luck since I realized it was gone. I lost at cards. Spilled a full mug of ale on my beard. Probably die in battle now, the way things are goin'.~ [BD51330]
@51331 = ~Slow down there. It's skill that sees you through battle, not luck.~
@51332 = ~Yeah, probably.~
@51333 = ~Superstitious nonsense.~
@51334 = ~It's just so... Wait. The other thing that went wrong is I got a hole in one o' me boots!~ [BD51334]
@51335 = ~My patron god is Marthammor Duin. His symbol is a boot with a mace against it. Maybe if I get some fancy new boots, my luck will change back!~ [BD51335]
@51336 = ~It's a bit of a stretch, but I'll go with it.~
@51337 = ~I wouldn't count on it. Worth a try though.~
@51338 = ~Can you really believe such idiocy?~
@51339 = ~I'm telling ya, this'll do it! I just need some good leather, and then maybe that quartermaster, Belegarm, will order some made for me. Could you help me out?~ [BD51339]
@51340 = ~I heard a bear's been sighted around Dead Man's Pass, but I can't leave my post. Bring the bear's hide to Belegarm, and get me some new boots!~ [BD51340]
@51341 = ~If it will make you feel better, I'll get you the boots.~
@51342 = ~All right, but you'll pay me well for these boots.~
@51343 = ~Go barefoot. I'll not waste time with this nonsense.~
@51344 = ~I know you're an important person with lots of things to do, but if you manage this, you'll have a loyal friend forever!~ [BD51344]
@51345 = ~There's a lot of work goes in to preparing a camp this size. You'll have to be quick about whatever you want. ~
@51346 = ~I'm in need of supplies.~
@51347 = ~Private Helvdar needs a new pair of boots made from this bearskin.~
@51348 = ~I'm here to pick up those new boots.~
@51349 = ~I'll come back another time.~
@51350 = ~Oh, really? Does he NEED a new pair of boots or does he WANT a new pair of boots? ~
@51351 = ~He needs them. He thinks without a new lucky charm he'll die in battle.~
@51352 = ~Without these boots, he's convinced he'll die in battle. That mindset will affect his ability to fight. It could even get others killed.~
@51353 = ~He wants them. I want you to make them for him. Do all three of us a favor and give two of us what we want.~
@51354 = ~What does it matter? He's a soldier and you're the quartermaster. Make the boots.~
@51355 = ~Fine, fine. It will take a day though. I don't see why he can't make do with a pair of these OTHER well-made boots.~
@51356 = ~Wait, you have new boots prepared? Could I get a pair for him and get the custom boots for myself?~
@51357 = ~Superstition isn't logical.~
@51358 = ~Thanks. I'll return in a day.~
@51359 = ~Make them well. I want a good reward for this.~
@51360 = ~Of course. They're free to soldiers who NEED them. I don't care what you do with the new ones once they're done. ~
@51361 = ~Thanks, I'll take a pair of ordinary boots.~
@51362 = ~Actually, I don't need a pair of ordinary boots.~
@51363 = ~Are you satisfied now? Then go! Let me work!~
@51364 = ~Here they are. A fine pair of boots too. I could have made three ordinary pairs in this time, but no.~
@51365 = ~Halt! Who goes there? ~
@51366 = ~It's me, Helvdar. I've got your boots.~
@51367 = ~It's just me, <CHARNAME>.~
@51368 = ~Aren't you supposed to say that to people OUTSIDE the barricade?~
@51369 = ~Watch your tone. I go where I please.~
@51370 = ~My new boots! Ah, let me see 'em!~ [BD51370]
@51371 = ~Here they are. A pair of genuine bearskin boots.~
@51372 = ~Here they are. They might look ordinary, but they're very lucky.~
@51373 = ~Actually, I've decided to keep them for myself.~
@51374 = ~What? Why would you do that?~ [BD51374]
@51375 = ~In the days ahead I suspect I'll need all the luck I can get.~
@51376 = ~They're worth a lot of money and I did all the work.~
@51377 = ~I'm just kidding. I brought them for you.~
@51378 = ~I heard you weren't to be trusted—guess I should've listened. People will hear o' this treachery, you can mark me on that.~ [BD51378]
@51379 = ~They look wonderful! Oh yes, these'll be lucky for sure! Thank you, thank you! Here, take these as a reward.~ [BD51379]
@51380 = ~And since you're a fellow dwarf, take this too.~ [BD51380]
@51381 = ~Are you sure they're lucky? They look like everyone else's boots.~ [BD51381]
@51382 = ~Look at that stitching! The detailing on the sides! These are genuine lucky boots, all right.~
@51383 = ~Of course they do—they were made by the same man who made everyone else's. But everyone else's boots aren't lucky. These are. Now give me a reward.~
@51384 = ~Actually, I was wrong. These are your real lucky boots.~
@51385 = ~You're tryin' to trick me!~ [BD51385]
@51386 = ~Yes, yes, you're right. These must be lucky! Thank you. Here, take these as a reward!~ [BD51386]
@51387 = ~Eh, they're comfortable too! Guard duty will be a breeze from now on.~ [BD51387]
@51388 = ~Crusader Tristian, at your service. May the Lady of Strategy bring you victory. ~
@51389 = ~And you as well.~
@51390 = ~Do you serve the crusade as a priest, then?~
@51391 = ~Your name's Tristian? Do you know a vigilant named Halasan?~
@51392 = ~May she bring victory to us all.~
@51393 = ~I don't need a god's blessing to be victorious.~
@51394 = ~I do. The Red Knight is the patron of tactics and strategy. I help coordinate planning and movement of Caelar's legions.~ [BD51394]
@51395 = ~You serve as a healer too, though, correct?~
@51396 = ~Will such things be needed in the Nine Hells?~
@51397 = ~What brought you to the crusade in the first place?~
@51398 = ~I have healing magic as well, but that's not my primary use. The fiends of the Nine Hells are orderly, regimented. It will take all our skill to outmaneuver them.~ [BD51398]
@51399 = ~Tell me, what was it that brought you to Caelar's service?~
@51400 = ~Do you really believe Caelar can march into Hell and somehow outmaneuver the devils in their own territory?~
@51401 = ~The crusade passed through my village and conscripted me. At first, I resisted them, but when Caelar explained her mission, I realized fate brought me to her.~ [BD51401]
@51402 = ~Without expert tactics, we don't stand a chance in the Hells. Caelar has put her faith in me, and I return that faith tenfold. She will lead us to victory.~ [BD51402]
@51403 = ~Your faith likewise inspires me.~
@51404 = ~It doesn't seem likely we're going to survive.~
@51405 = ~You really think Caelar is going to march us into Hell somehow and outmaneuver the devils there?~
@51406 = ~Have faith, my friend. I believe Caelar could call down holy fire from heaven itself to blast the fiends to dust. She will see us through this. Now please excuse me. I must return to my duties.~ [BD51406]
@51407 = ~I am glad to hear it. Now please excuse me. I must return to my duties.~ [BD51407]
@51408 = ~Ugggggh...~
@51409 = ~Come on, Sallo. Get up! Get up, damn you!~
@51410 = ~Forget it. The Shining Lady herself couldn't sober him up right now. Commander Dreon will not be pleased.~
@51411 = ~What's the problem?~
@51412 = ~Why will Commander Dreon care?~
@51413 = ~I'll leave you to your troubles.~
@51414 = ~The problem is that Sallo here can't stay out of the booze. Every few days, we find him passed out in a drunken stupor.~
@51415 = ~Every brave soul needs a way to relax.~ [BD51415]
@51416 = ~Sallo's supposed to take Dreon the morning report. If Sallo doesn't show, Dreon will want to know why, and guess who'll reap what the drunkard's sown? Us, that's who.~
@51417 = ~Wait... you look just like <PRO_HIMHER>. You're practically twins!~
@51418 = ~I've heard that before.~
@51419 = ~I really don't see the resemblance.~
@51420 = ~Don't drag me into this!~
@51421 = ~Wait, you're new here, right? I don't recognize your face. Are you a mercenary?~
@51422 = ~What do I have to do?~
@51423 = ~What's in it for me?~
@51424 = ~I've more important matters than this to attend to.~
@51425 = ~Get a flask of wine from the casks here. Then find Morale Officer Deneld, get a copy of the morning report, and take it and the wine to Dreon. Couldn't be simpler. If you want a fresh uniform, take one from the crates over there.~
@51426 = ~That sounds easy enough. Very well, I'll do as you ask.~
@51427 = ~What's in it for me?~
@51428 = ~I have more important matters to attend to.~
@51429 = ~Dreon's wrath will fall on ALL of us, so it's in your own best interests to help. I suppose I could give you a couple of potions as well. What do you say?~
@51430 = ~Sounds easy enough. I'll do it.~
@51431 = ~I have more important matters to attend to.~
@51432 = ~Thanks, friend! Don't forget to wear a clean uniform. Deneld's a stickler for that sort of thing.~
@51433 = ~All right, I understand. If you change your mind and get that report to Dreon, let us know, though, hey?~
@51434 = ~Hello, recruit. You must be new. ~
@51435 = ~Yes, sir. I'm here for the morning report.~
@51436 = ~Yes, I just joined a short time ago.~
@51437 = ~What gave me away?~
@51438 = ~I may be new, but I'm not inexperienced in the ways of war.~
@51439 = ~Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down there. What's this now? Why aren't you in uniform? You can't go about official crusade business looking like that.~ [BD51439]
@51440 = ~Apologies, sir. I'll return when I'm properly dressed.~
@51441 = ~There's a cloth shortage right now, thanks to the accursed besiegers. We new recruits have to forgo uniforms for now.~
@51442 = ~The commander needs that report NOW, sir. I don't have time to shine my boots.~
@51443 = ~You'll look far worse than I do if you don't hand that report over.~
@51444 = ~There's always time for procedure, recruit. Dismissed!~ [BD51444]
@51445 = ~That's how you speak to a superior officer? Crusaders, come here! This fool needs to learn some discipline!~ [BD51445]
@51446 = ~I see. Thank you for the update, recruit. I have the report here. Who sent you to retrieve it?~ [BD51446]
@51447 = ~I have the report here. Who sent you to retrieve it?~
@51448 = ~Commander Deneld.~
@51449 = ~It was Commander Dreon, sir. I'm to bring him the report as well as a drink to start the day.~
@51450 = ~Commander Dorwin.~
@51451 = ~Commander Dreon.~
@51452 = ~Commander Dargon.~
@51453 = ~Hmm... I don't know the name, but I suppose that's what comes of being part of a vital and growing movement. Still, I can't just hand the report over to a recruit I've never met for an officer I don't know. Dismissed.~ [BD51453]
@51454 = ~I'M Deneld, and I certainly didn't ask you to retrieve this report from myself.~ [BD51454]
@51455 = ~My mistake. I meant Commander Dorwin.~
@51456 = ~I meant to say Commander Dreon, sir. I'm to bring him the report as well as a drink to start the day.~
@51457 = ~I misspoke. It's Commander Dreon.~
@51458 = ~Apologies, it was actually Commander Dargon.~
@51459 = ~Dreon, you say? Good man. Disciplined. I like him. Here's the report. On your way now!~ [BD51459]
@51460 = ~I don't talk to recruits. ~
@51461 = ~I'm here to deliver the morning report, sir.~
@51462 = ~And I wouldn't ask you to, sir. I'm just here to give you the morning report and your wine.~
@51463 = ~And I've no time for fools.~
@51464 = ~Oh, it's you. Do you have my wine as well? ~
@51465 = ~It's here, sir.~
@51466 = ~I'll get it right away.~
@51467 = ~See that you do. I have no patience for failure.~
@51468 = ~Excellent, Sallo. You... you are Sallo, aren't you? You look different somehow.~
@51469 = ~The rigors of war, sir. They change a <PRO_MANWOMAN> from one day to the next.~
@51470 = ~I'm defintely Sallo, sir.~
@51471 = ~Of course I'm Sallo. It's not like I have a near-identical twin wandering around the camp.~
@51472 = ~You're right, I'm actually a spy with a coincidental resemblance to Sallo.~
@51473 = ~I see. I could have sworn your hair was much shorter yesterday. ~
@51474 = ~The pressures of battle can play tricks on a soldier's mind. I assure you, I'm Sallo.~
@51475 = ~I don't know what to tell you. I'm definitely Sallo.~
@51476 = ~I wore it pulled back yesterday, that's all.~
@51477 = ~I can see this isn't going to work. I'm actually a spy from the alliance camp. Draw steel and defend yourself!~
@51478 = ~Ha! That's the Sallo I know. Such a joker.~
@51479 = ~I suppose the stress is getting to me. Of course you couldn't be anyone but Sallo.~
@51480 = ~I have to say... I'm impressed you look so put together this morning. After all the wine we drank last night, I expected you to be passed out until noon!~
@51481 = ~Thanks for the report, for the hair of the dog, and for being discreet about our, ah, festivities last night. Carry on!~
@51482 = ~Hello again. How goes your day?~
@51483 = ~I got the report to Dreon.~
@51484 = ~Not bad.~
@51485 = ~If it weren't for the giant battle brewing, I'd be having a great day.~
@51486 = ~I don't have time to chat.~
@51487 = ~Greetings again. I hope you're well. ~
@51488 = ~I got the report to Dreon.~
@51489 = ~Well enough.~
@51490 = ~You know how it is. I shouldn't complain, but I will, just to keep in practice.~
@51491 = ~I'm very busy. I have to go.~
@51492 = ~What kin I do for ya?~ [BD51492]
@51493 = ~You did? Great! You really saved our hides. Dreon's impossible when things don't go his way.~
@51494 = ~You're lucky I happened along.~
@51495 = ~I think my intervention here is worth a reward, don't you?~
@51496 = ~He does have a... prickly quality about him.~
@51497 = ~Absolutely. Here's a couple potions I've been saving. I'll happily part with them knowing we won't have Dreon on our tail all day.~
@51498 = ~Come by again sometime. ~
@51499 = ~Have a good day.~
@51500 = ~You can say that again.~
@51501 = ~That's good to hear.~
@51502 = ~Maybe we're not praying hard enough?~
@51503 = ~Mighty Foehammer! Hear our cries!~
@51504 = ~I don't understand.~
@51505 = ~Praise be to Tempus!~
@51506 = ~I don't feel any different.~
@51507 = ~This isn't working.~
@51508 = ~I thought I would feel something... a sense of rightness or peace.~
@51509 = ~I thought the Foehammer would acknowledge our efforts in SOME way.~
@51510 = ~Ah! Oh, hello. You startled me. Is there something we can do for you?~
@51511 = ~What are you doing?~
@51512 = ~Are you praying to a rock?~
@51513 = ~I doubt it. You appear busy.~
@51514 = ~We found this stone in the ruins around here. Tempus's symbol is engraved on it. Since he's the god of battle, we're praying for his aid.~
@51515 = ~I'd have thought Caelar's holiness and our crusade's cause would ensure Tempus's blessing. But so far, we've felt nothing.~
@51516 = ~The will of gods isn't always obvious. I'm certain the Lord of Battles heard your plea.~
@51517 = ~Maybe Tempus is really, really busy at the moment? There's a lot of war going around these days.~
@51518 = ~The gods have more important things to do than listen to your drivel.~
@51519 = ~No, no, you're wrong! The gods care for their worshippers. We matter to them!~
@51520 = ~We weren't expecting a voice from the heavens, but SOME sense of grace or comfort isn't too much to ask, is it? Why would Tempus ignore Caelar's righteous warriors?~
@51521 = ~Perhaps Caelar is not so holy as she seems. Why else would Tempus ignore your prayers?~
@51522 = ~Gods, right? What can you do?~
@51523 = ~I'll leave you to your attempts, then.~
@51524 = ~Gods do not always scream in the faithful ear. Sometimes they whisper.~ [BD51524]
@51525 = ~When my patron speaks to me, I feel his voice in the marrow of my bones.~
@51526 = ~Gods do not always scream in their faithfuls' ears. Sometimes they whisper.~ [BD51526]
@51527 = ~Oh, I hate it when they do that. It tickles.~ [BD51527]
@51528 = ~No true crusader would speak of Caelar that way!~
@51529 = ~Wait! Perhaps you can help us catch Tempus's ear.~
@51530 = ~This icon is very old. See the cracks here? Two chunks of the stone have fallen out. Could that be the problem?~
@51531 = ~If you could find the two shards, maybe we could reconstruct the icon and Tempus would finally respond!~
@51532 = ~I see no harm in trying it. Do you have any idea where the shards might be?~
@51533 = ~Stranger things have happened. If I find the shards, I'll return to you.~
@51534 = ~I've no interest in encouraging your pathetic endeavor.~
@51535 = ~Thank you! We found the icon in that rubble to the north, but fragments could be anywhere in camp—check any of the rubble you come across. I saw Morale Officer Deneld walking through the area too. He might have seen something.~
@51536 = ~Ideally the shards would be blessed by a priest of Tempus, but I don't suppose you can help with that. Farewell, and good luck to you.~
@51537 = ~Hello, recruit. You must be new. ~
@51538 = ~New, but already working hard. I'm searching for a stone shard about so big.~
@51539 = ~Yes, I just joined a short time ago.~
@51540 = ~What gave me away?~
@51541 = ~New to Caelar's service, yes, but I'm not without experience in the ways of war.~
@51542 = ~A stone shard? Whatever for? ~
@51543 = ~I'm trying to restore a stone icon of Tempus.~
@51544 = ~It's classified. A special mission from one of the high-ups.~
@51545 = ~None of your business.~
@51546 = ~Really? Intriguing... Yes, now that you mention it, I believe I did happen upon the shard you seek. Here it is—I trust you will let those who assigned you this mission know of my cooperation? Good fortune to you for its successful completion.~
@51547 = ~Watch yourself—I'll not stand for insubordination. I suppose you're trying to reconstruct that icon I saw those other recruits messing around with.~
@51548 = ~I don't approve of recruits trying to directly curry the gods' favor. Caelar is our spiritual leader.~
@51549 = ~Faerûn is a land of many gods. More divine power supporting us can only be a good thing. Surely you can see that.~
@51550 = ~I am a holy <PRO_MANWOMAN>. I understand your devotion to Caelar, but only a fool turns their back on the gods.~
@51551 = ~Tempus is a god of strength. It's best for all of us if to curry his favor however we can.~
@51552 = ~I understand your doubts, but we need recruit morale to stay high. Trust me, no harm will come from giving me the shard.~
@51553 = ~There's something to what you say, I can't deny it. Here, take the shard and go forth to do the Shining Lady's work.~
@51554 = ~I think not. The shard stays in my pocket.~
@51555 = ~Explain your reasoning again?~
@51556 = ~Goodbye, then.~
@51557 = ~Go forth, for the crusade! ~
@51558 = ~Tempus, the lord of strength at arms and military might, will lead us to victory! ~

@51562 = ~I COULD, yes. Where is this icon? I would like to look upon it. ~
@51563 = ~I'm afraid it's in the crusader camp. I've been posing as a recruit there.~
@51564 = ~That would be a bad idea. The crusaders have it.~
@51565 = ~It's out of our reach right now.~
@51566 = ~A shame. To answer your question, yes, I could bless the broken pieces to help make the icon whole again. ~
@51567 = ~Wait, you're not mad that the crusaders are praying to Tempus? No blistering invectives?~
@51568 = ~You took that a lot better than I'd feared.~

@51625 = ~That's... that's great, Slug. Maybe just try and limit the smashing to crusader heads, yes?~
@51626 = ~Please, don't. Think of your mistreatment at the crusade's hands—would you truly make others victims, as Caelar's servants made you one?~

@51640 = ~This far I'll go, then, and no further.~
@51641 = ~I would go farther. Do not try to stop me.~

@51651 = ~Looka that, Battuks! They got one of'r sisters with'm!~
@51652 = ~All who would pass by here must pay the toll.~
@51653 = ~According to who?~

@51657 = ~Not particularly, no. If this is as far as we can go, so be it.~
@51658 = ~I don't want to fight you. I mean, look at you. It wouldn't be MUCH of a fight, would it?~
@51659 = ~Fight? No. Drench the ground in the blood of idiot goblins? Yes. Oh yes.~
@51660 = ~They don't wanna fight, Battuks! What're we gonna do?~
@51661 = ~They don't wanna fight, they gotta pay.~
@51662 = ~Pay?~
@51663 = ~Careful, hobgoblin. Not wanting to fight is not the same as being unwilling to fight.~
@51664 = ~Pay you? I think not. The most you'll get from me is a quick death. Stand aside, or suffer the consequences.~
@51665 = ~You don't gotta pay the toll if ye're crusade. You crusade?~
@51666 = ~I'd sooner pay the toll than shed your blood, hobgoblin. How much will this cost me?~
@51667 = ~Of course! What in the hells would I be doing in this godsforsaken place if I weren't with the crusade?~
@51668 = ~If it makes you feel better, sure, I'm with the crusade.~
@51669 = ~I'm on a crusade, of a sort. But mine is much different than Caelar's.~

@51671 = ~Stupid Softbelcher! You let them pass without paying the toll?~
@51672 = ~Look at <PRO_HIMHER>, Raggemos! What're we gonna do to someone like that? Nothin'. An' we'd shed blood and break our bones doin' it.~
@51673 = ~Fah! Coward! You think the crusade will treat us better if we don't do our job? Fool, you are! Fool!~
@51674 = ~We speak for the Shining Lady, Caelar. She bid us mind these paths and collect the toll.~
@51675 = ~I find that hard to believe.~
@51676 = ~I also serve the will of Caelar. Look, I've got her seal right here.~
@51677 = ~The crusade must be in dire straits indeed, using scum like you to enforce the Shining Lady's will.~
@51678 = ~No, no, 's true. We work for the Lady.~
@51679 = ~It says it's with the crusade, Battuks.~
@51680 = ~Shut it, Sickly! I'll take care o'this. So you're with the Lady, eh?~
@51681 = ~You doubt it? Here, I have her seal.~
@51682 = ~I don't think it would be lying to say I have a part in Caelar's plans.~
@51683 = ~You could put it that way. I wouldn't, because I value accuracy, but if it'll spare me a toll or a fight, feel free.~
@51684 = ~I'm not with her yet, but I eagerly await the moment I am.~
@51685 = ~So y'do, so y'do. Awright then. You c'n pass.~
@51686 = ~Stupid Softbelcher! You let them pass without paying the toll?~

@51689 = ~Your snake words won't get you past us, <PRO_RACE>. You're paying the toll, with gold or your life.~
@51690 = ~50 gold.~
@51691 = ~Be silent, Sickly! Yer betters're talking. Ignore the boy. Toll's 50 gold a head.~
@51692 = ~Very well.~
@51693 = ~That seems an onerous burden, considering.~
@51694 = ~I'm not paying that. I guess I'll be going back the way I came, then.~
@51695 = ~I have a counter-offer: Give me 50 gold, and I'll leave you YOUR head.~
@51696 = ~Awright. Be off with you, then.~
@51697 = ~Good, Battuks. You did good.~
@51698 = ~They isn't gonna pay! Get'm!~
@51699 = ~What? We ain't payin' you!~
@51700 = ~That is unfortunate. For you.~
@51701 = ~We seem to have reached an impasse. What do you suggest we do here?~
@51702 = ~Oh, you'll pay, goblin. One way or another.~
@51703 = ~Less jus' call it even, hey? You be on yer way, we'll be on ours. ~
@51704 = ~Agreed.~
@51705 = ~I'm afraid it's too late for that. At this point, I can accept nothing less than your bloody demise. You may throw yourself on your own blade, or, if you prefer, I can kill you myself. Which will it be?~

@51713 = ~M'Khiin is no prisoner of mine—she is free to do as she wishes. I doubt she'll go willingly with you.~
@51714 = ~Let's talk prices. How much will it cost for us to pass through here without someone getting hurt?~
@51715 = ~Her mind is her own—she is free to do as she wishes. Whether she's with me or not, I doubt she'll willingly go with you.~
@51716 = ~M'Khiin stays with me. Isn't that right, M'Khiin?~
@51717 = ~Release her? Very well, then. M'Khiin, you are released. Go, be with your people.~
@51718 = ~Back away or SOMEONE will pay a price.~

@51729 = ~There's nothing to get her out of, you idiot! She chose to travel with me.~
@51730 = ~How terribly noble of you. A question, though: If you're going to "rescue" M'Khiin, who will save you?~
@51731 = ~Better you than this lot.~
@51732 = ~Not exactly the highest bar to clear, that, is it?~
@51733 = ~We're wasting time. A slaughter is inevitable—let it begin sooner than later.~
@51734 = ~Can't do it. Not while you got one of ours.~
@51735 = ~I don't belong to you.~
@51736 = ~Silence! Your betters speak.~

Glint has made a most unusual request, and one that I look forward to accommodating at the earliest opportunity. He wants me to beat up his cousin Pritchard to prevent the fellow from getting killed.~
@52044 = ~Glint Gardnersonson

I should continue to watch for Glint's relatives on our travels.

Glint loves his cousin Pritchard, but fears for his safety in the allied camp. Having met the man, I can say Glint's fears are well-founded. However, I couldn't do as Glint asked and drive Pritchard away. When the time comes to face Caelar, we'll need every man we can get.~
@52045 = ~Pritchard's Family Stiletto +2~
@52046 = ~This thin, nasty-looking blade was wielded by the gnomish Gardnersonson family in two Dragonspear Wars. Though delicate in appearance and obviously designed for a smaller than human hand, the weapon is extraordinarily effective when turned against ogres, giants, ettins, and other similarly sized creatures.

@52047 = ~Glint Gardnersonson

I should continue to watch for Glint's relatives on our travels.

Pritchard Gardnersonson won't be bothering anyone in the Daggerford militia anymore.~
@52048 = ~Glint Gardnersonson

I should continue to watch for Glint's relatives on our travels.

Pritchard Gardnersonson has been driven from the Dragonspear siege camp. Before he left, he gifted Glint with a family heirloom—a dagger wielded by Glint's uncle in the last Dragonspear War.~
@52049 = ~Glint Gardnersonson

I should continue to watch for Glint's relatives on our travels.

I didn't actually kill Pritchard Gardnersonson, but his "friends" don't need to know that. With Pritchard dealt with we can resume our search for the rest of Glint's relatives.~
@52050 = ~Is there anything better than being rewarded for pursuing one's passions? I think not.~
@52051 = ~Nimblefinger Gloves~
@52052 = ~Fashioned from the finest doeskin available, this pair of gloves was obviously designed for gnomish hands (though dwarves and other shorter races might also be able to use them). For the right wearer, the gloves offer protection and comfort in equal proportion. Fitting like a second skin, the user becomes more sensitive to what their hands are doing; this added focus increases the wearer's nimbleness and dexterity.

@52053 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I should take Rhonda to speak with the ogres that lift people up into Dragonspear Castle.

Glint's cousin, Rhonda, was taken by the crusade and forced to work as a seamstress in the warrens beneath Dragonspear Castle. She knows the ogres who man the lift up to the castle's basement, and has agreed to help us convince them to allow us passage.~
@52054 = ~Glint Gardnersonson

I told Rhonda that she should escape.

I encountered Rhonda, a young gnome torn from her family and forced to serve the crusade as a seamstress, in the warrens beneath Dragonspear Castle. I advised her to flee through the underground river caverns. She'll not have a better chance to escape than she does now.~
@52055 = ~Glint~
@52056 = ~You're going in the wrong direction, <CHARNAME>. ~
@52057 = ~Forgive me, Corwin.~
@52058 = ~You really don't want to talk to this man, do you?~
@52059 = ~You fear this man, Corwin? I thought you were made of sterner stuff than that.~
@52060 = ~Talk to him? No. That's about the last thing I want to do to him.~
@52061 = ~I'm flesh and bone, same as everyone else. And I'd rather keep my flesh on my bones, so let's go the other way, shall we?~
@52062 = ~Don't make me have to forgive you. Let's just get away from here.~
@52063 = ~All right. I don't think he saw me. ~
@52064 = ~Who is he, Corwin? Why are you afraid of him?~
@52065 = ~If he knows you, he might be willing to tell you something of the crusade's plans. This could be an opportunity.~
@52066 = ~Is that a story I smell? Tell me everything, dear lady. I'm all ears.~
@52067 = ~I mislike flight. Especially from a foe I could clearly best. Explain yourself.~
@52068 = ~I don't know who that was, nor do I care. Let's forget him and be about our business.~
@52069 = ~It's possible I could agree with you more, but at the moment I really can't think how. Let's go.~
@52070 = ~His name's Beno Famari. And it's not him I'm worried about, it's the hundreds of crusaders that'll come running if we cross paths. Because if that happens, there's a better than good chance I'll kill him again.~ [BD52070]
@52071 = ~I need to know exactly what's going on, Corwin.~
@52072 = ~Or you might be able to gather some intelligence about the crusade.~
@52073 = ~We'd better get out of here, then.~
@52074 = ~I can't imagine Beno willingly telling me anything useful. There's no love for me left in his coward heart.~ [BD52074]
@52075 = ~Left? So there was love once?~
@52076 = ~I need to know exactly what's going on here.~
@52077 = ~Best we avoid him, then.~
@52078 = ~Let's go.~
@52079 = ~That's one way of putting it. Come on, let's get out of here.~
@52080 = ~In a moment. First, I'd like to hear more about this Beno Famari.~
@52081 = ~You don't seriously expect me to drop this, do you? Tell me about this mystery man of yours.~
@52082 = ~As you wish.~
@52083 = ~Fine. Beno and I were... together. It was a long time ago, and it didn't end well, especially for him. I got Rohma, so I'm not complaining.~ [BD52083]
@52084 = ~He fathered your daughter?~
@52085 = ~Beno doesn't strike me as a true believer in Caelar. A mercenary, more than likely. Could you speak to him, perhaps learn something of the crusade's defenses?~
@52086 = ~This Beno—I take it he hasn't been much involved in Rohma's life.~
@52087 = ~Yet you do not wish to speak to your daughter's father.~
@52088 = ~That explains your antipathy. All right, forget Beno. Let's do what we came here to do.~
@52089 = ~He was there when she was conceived. He was never her father. When I told him about Rohma...~ [BD52089]
@52090 = ~You raised a beautiful and intelligent child. I hate that this war takes you away from her.~
@52091 = ~If you can elicit even a little information about the crusade from Beno, our chances of survival will improve.~
@52092 = ~Yet you left your daughter to go battle an army of religious zealots hundreds of miles away.~
@52093 = ~The smart thing for us to do would be to leave this place.~
@52094 = ~Whatever I do in this life, whatever regrets I have, Rohma's not one of them. She never will be. I love her. Which is just one of the many reasons I'd rather avoid dying here.~ [BD52094]
@52095 = ~A sentiment I am sure we all share.~
@52096 = ~There are three things in my life that matter to me, <CHARNAME>. My daughter, my father, and the Flaming Fist. Each saved me, in their own way. When one of them calls on me, I answer. Always.~ [BD52096]
@52097 = ~This is no good, <CHARNAME>. Think about what you're saying. Bringing a little girl into battle with such an army would not be practical.~ [BD52097]
@52098 = ~You do yourself a disservice, living in bondage to an organization that cares nothing for you.~
@52099 = ~Says the half-orc that serves a demon. You're not really in a position to be throwing stones here, big boy.~ [BD52099]
@52100 = ~Keep talking, gnome. You'll miss it after I rip your tongue from your mouth.~
@52101 = ~If you really think I should talk to him, I will, but I'm telling you it's not a good idea.~ [BD52101]
@52102 = ~We have to try, Corwin.~
@52103 = ~He abandoned you and Rohma, did he not? It seems to me you're the injured party here.~
@52104 = ~How badly did things end? Other than the part where you killed him repeatedly, I mean.~
@52105 = ~Very well. Let us depart before he sees you.~
@52106 = ~He hurt me; I hurt him back. Let's just leave it at that. If you want to talk to him, let's go. Otherwise, we should get back to our camp.~ [BD52106]
@52107 = ~If you insist. But whatever happens is on your head.~ [BD52107]
@52108 = ~<CHARNAME>! Captain Corwin clearly has no desire to speak to this man again. To even consider such a thing is beneath you.~
@52109 = ~Pretty badly, I'm guessing. On a scale of one to apocalyptic, I'd wager on something around "terrible."~ [BD52109]
@52110 = ~You assume men approach such things rationally. You really shouldn't.~
@52111 = ~Yes, and men are SO rational when it comes to such matters. You know better than that, <CHARNAME>. At least you should.~
@52112 = ~Helm's steely eye... Schael? Is that you?~ [BD52112]
@52113 = ~...Beno.~ [BD52113]
@52114 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. Pleased to meet you.~
@52115 = ~You know this man, Corwin? Why don't you introduce us?~
@52116 = ~This is no time to chat, Corwin. The Shining Lady's business must be done without delay.~
@52117 = ~Stand aside, mercenary. I'll not waste time on the likes of you.~
@52118 = ~Because we're leaving.~
@52119 = ~Come now. I know Audamar taught you better manners than that. Beno Famari. Glad to meet you—though I must admit I'm surprised to see Schael again here, of all places.~
@52120 = ~I have to go, Beno. We're on important business.~ [BD52120]
@52121 = ~I'm surprised, Schael. You were always so loyal to the Flaming Fist. What made you turn to Caelar?~ [BD52121]
@52122 = ~You heard <PRO_HIMHER>, Beno. We've got to go.~
@52123 = ~I'm not stopping you. I know better than to try. Farewell.~
@52124 = ~Just—hold for a moment. It's been a long time, Schael. I'm surprised to see you here.~
@52125 = ~It's a common enough tale, to be sure, but I have a hard time believing it. Schael Corwin turn against Baldur's Gate? I just can't see it.~ [BD52125]
@52126 = ~I'm Beno Famari. I'm surprised to see you, Schael.~ [BD52126]
@52127 = ~No more than I am to see you. You'll have to excuse us. We're on, uh, official crusade business.~ [BD52127]
@52128 = ~I'm sure. But what are you doing on this side of the wall? As a loyal member of the Flaming Fist, I'd think you'd be outside, laying siege to the castle.~
@52129 = ~We live in interesting times.~
@52130 = ~We have seen the Shining Lady's light. We are here to serve her will.~
@52131 = ~She's with me. I have come to see what Caelar Argent has to offer a <PRO_MANWOMAN> such as myself.~
@52132 = ~Caelar pays better than the Flaming Fist.~
@52133 = ~We've no time for this. Come, Corwin. We're leaving.~
@52134 = ~The Schael Corwin I know would never turn on the Flaming Fist. That was why things turned sour between us.~ [BD52134]
@52135 = ~That had nothing to do with what happened to us, Beno, and you know it. I'm not who I was when we were together. Motherhood opened my eyes. I want more from life than what the Fist promised. Is that so hard to believe?~ [BD52135]
@52136 = ~Just answer me one question, Schael. Just one question and I'll let you be on your way.~ [BD52136]
@52137 = ~How is... What is her name? Rohma, yes? How is my daughter?~ [BD52137]
@52138 = ~You've got no right to ask her that. Not after what you put her through.~
@52139 = ~As I understand it, you've never had anything to do with Rohma. Why do you care now?~
@52140 = ~Mind your step, Famari. You're heading into dangerous territory.~
@52141 = ~You ask her about Rohma? Are you mad, man? Or have you developed some sick taste for dying?~
@52142 = ~This conversation is over.~
@52143 = ~You may be telling it true, friend. But the Schael Corwin I knew would never turn on the Flaming Fist. She's a spy, and I'm gonna make a pile of gold turnin' her in.~ [BD52143]
@52144 = ~You and I are of one mind on that, my friend. But the Schael Corwin I knew? She would never turn on the Flaming Fist. Never. That was why things turned so sour between us.~
@52145 = ~They are at that. So how have you been, Schael?~
@52146 = ~Not that interesting. The Schael Corwin I knew would never turn on the Flaming Fist. That was why things turned so sour between us.~
@52147 = ~Schael didn't tell you? Well, I guess I was dead the last time she saw me. Come on, Schael. Tell me about OUR daughter.~
@52148 = ~She is well. Healthy and full of life. Cared for and well-loved. And now it is time for us to leave.~
@52149 = ~You gave up any right you had to be in Rohma's life a long time ago.~
@52150 = ~Rohma is well enough, though she's on the verge of losing a father.~
@52151 = ~Wouldn't be the first time, eh, Schael?~
@52152 = ~TAKE THEM!~
@52153 = ~I'm glad to hear the girl's well. Perhaps it will cushion the blow of losing her mother.~
@52154 = ~Good. That's good to know. Well, I'll not keep you any longer. We're beginning preparations for the final attack. This will all be over soon, one way or another.~ [BD52154]
@52155 = ~...Very well, I take your point. I'll not keep you. Goodbye, Schael.~ [BD52155]
@52156 = ~Beno, wait. Just this once, think of Rohma...~ [BD52156]
@52157 = ~I have a right to know about my child.~ [BD52157]
@52158 = ~Galad! That is low, Schael, even for you. My daughter's gone her whole life without a father. Let's see how she makes do without a mother...~ [BD52158]
@52159 = ~I suppose I did at that. Farewell, Schael. Truly.~
@52160 = ~What in the Nine Hells is going on here? ~
@52161 = ~You! Explain yourself! ~
@52162 = ~This man was a coward. He was without morals, knew nothing of honor. And so I slew him.~
@52163 = ~This mercenary was no true servant of Caelar.~
@52164 = ~There really isn't much to explain. This man was scum. I dealt with him accordingly.~
@52165 = ~I owe you no explanation.~
@52166 = ~Be that as it may, he was doing Caelar's work. Sometimes we must humble ourselves, and work with the unworthy to achieve our greater goals. ~
@52167 = ~You are right. I will try to keep it in mind in future.~
@52168 = ~So humility is the key to victory? You've given me much to think about. I will consider your words as I think on this.~
@52169 = ~I humble myself for no one, fool. Not for Caelar and certainly not for you.~
@52170 = ~I dislike them too, but Caelar has decreed we must tolerate their presence, for now, at least. Killing them puts her plans at risk. Would you have that go unpunished?~
@52171 = ~No, sir. I am at your mercy. Should you in your wisdom spare my life, know that this scenario will not repeat itself. I'll control my temper.~
@52172 = ~Yes...?~
@52173 = ~I don't see that you have much choice in the matter.~
@52174 = ~Clean up the bodies, then return to your duties. And in future, do not let yourself be ruled by impulse. Know that our goal is righteous and all, even mercenary scum, have a role to play. Now go.~
@52175 = ~Is there a cleric among you?~
@52176 = ~I am a cleric.~
@52177 = ~My friend here is a cleric.~
@52178 = ~No.~
@52179 = ~I'm afraid not.~
@52180 = ~And if there is, what of it?~
@52181 = ~I want these men healed and back in fighting shape immediately, you understand? When they're on their feet, bring them to me and we'll sort this matter out, whatever it was.~
@52182 = ~Someone fetch a cleric! I want these men resurrected. When that's done, bring them and the holy avenger here to me.~
@52183 = ~We should get out of here quickly, before Beno's resurrected. Let's go.~
@52184 = ~Oh, bind me, here we go...~ [BD52184]
@52185 = ~Such insolence. You are not fit to wear a Ring of the Crusade. Give it to me and begone from this place, or on my honor, I'll take it from your corpse.~
@52186 = ~Here, then. Take the ring.~
@52187 = ~No need to go that far. Take the ring. It was never a good fit anyway.~
@52188 = ~You want the ring? Come and take it.~
@52189 = ~You impudent... You disrespect me? ME? How dare you?~
@52190 = ~Those who wear this ring earned it in service to the Shining Lady. Out of respect for that, I will let you leave this place alive. Begone.~
@52191 = ~The Lady's blessing and a month's pay to whoever brings me that brazen cur's head!~
@52192 = ~So do you really want these fellows healed, <CHARNAME>? I'll do what I can for them if you want, but they didn't endear themselves to me when they attacked us. ~
@52193 = ~Do not tell me you seriously expect me to resurrect these men, <CHARNAME>. ~
@52194 = ~I won't tell you to do it, Viconia. But you will, nevertheless. It's the right thing to do.~
@52195 = ~Why not?~
@52196 = ~The only reason I'd restore them to life is so that I could have the pleasure of cutting them down again.~
@52197 = ~Even if we weren't in the middle of a camp full of our enemies, I could think of a few reasons. As it is, I can think of a few hundred.~
@52198 = ~An intriguing notion. But this isn't the place to indulge such fancies, I think.~
@52199 = ~The drow's right. Let's go.~
@52200 = ~They tried to kill us. Let death be their reward.~
@52201 = ~What? You? Stay away from me! Back, stay away! ~
@52202 = ~You there. I told you to resurrect those mercenaries you killed. Where are they? ~
@52203 = ~They were restored to life as ordered, sir. But the moment their lungs again drew breath, they fled.~
@52204 = ~I'm still working on getting them on their feet again, sir.~
@52205 = ~I left them where they fell. I answer to Caelar and Caelar alone.~
@52206 = ~Feeding the worms. You can join them, if you wish.~
@52207 = ~Bloody mercenaries...! You were right to slay them. Here, take this—it's what they would have been paid had they remained. Their lives aren't worth this much, but I regret forcing you to restore them now. Enough of that. Return to your duties.~
@52208 = ~You cost the crusade much-needed assets this day. But in restoring them you paid a cost yourself. In truth, we're better off without cowards in our ranks. It's time to put this behind us. Return to your duties.~
@52209 = ~Well, see that you do. Mercenaries or no, we'll need every sword we can get when the enemy makes their move.~
@52210 = ~I see. Forgive my impertinence, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I'll leave you to your business.~
@52211 = ~Do you see Caelar here? Because I don't. And as long as I don't, you answer to me. Now find a way to restore those men or by the gods I'll see you join them!~
@52212 = ~You threaten me? Intolerable. Take <PRO_HIMHER>, and fetch me my whip. It's time this lunatic learned <PRO_HISHER> place in the holy crusade.~
@52213 = ~Yeah, what do you want?~ [BD52213]
@52214 = ~Your name will do for a start.~
@52215 = ~I would know what the Shining Lady pays you for your service, mercenary.~
@52216 = ~I want to save your soul from eternal damnation. Have you heard the word of the great Lathander?~
@52217 = ~I want nothing from you.~
@52218 = ~It'll do for an end too. I'm Beno Famari. Now get thee gone. One more sermon singing the Shining Lady's praises and I swear I'll go to work for the Waterdhavians.~ [BD52218]
@52219 = ~I am no crusader.~
@52220 = ~You're not one of Caelar's zealots then. What do you make of the Shining Lady?~
@52221 = ~You would join those who lay siege to the castle?~
@52222 = ~You would betray Caelar?~
@52223 = ~I shall take my leave of you, then.~
@52224 = ~A mercenary, then. Better than a crusader, I suppose. What do you want?~ [BD52224]
@52225 = ~Tell what the Shining Lady pays for your service.~
@52226 = ~What's your take on Caelar?~
@52227 = ~What I want you cannot provide. I'll take my leave of you.~
@52228 = ~More than she'd pay if I started discussing private business arrangements with strangers. Begone. You're making my knuckles itch.~ [BD52228]
@52229 = ~I haven't. I've heard the bones of people who preach at me break, though. Be on your way, godsbotherer.~ [BD52229]
@52230 = ~No, not really. I've had... issues... with certain Flaming Fists. I doubt they're among those surrounding the castle, but better safe than sorry. Now excuse me, we were discussing private matters.~ [BD52230]
@52231 = ~Then it's your lucky day. Fare thee well, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~ [BD52231]
@52232 = ~She's mad as a mouther, but she pays well and on time. I've served worse. Now if you'll excuse us, we were discussing some private matters. Farewell.~ [BD52232]
@52233 = ~You do that.~
@52234 = ~Bloody godbotherer...~ [BD52234]
@52235 = ~Ach, my head, it pounds like waves against against a longship's hull. If I could perhaps sit down...?~
@52236 = ~That's enough out of you!~
@52237 = ~You there! Hero of Baldur's Gate. This man belong to you?~
@52238 = ~He's a friend, yes. What seems to be the trouble?~
@52239 = ~What's he done THIS time?~
@52240 = ~Certainly not.~
@52241 = ~Just a misunderstanding, ja? They say "stop," I hear "go." It is all very confusing.~
@52242 = ~Your friend here caused quite a ruckus last night. Drinking to excess, chasing the women officers, picking fights with the men. ~
@52243 = ~He mentioned your name when we arrested him. Otherwise he'd be in the stocks right now.~
@52244 = ~It was not so bad, <CHARNAME>. I may have had one drink too many, paid a slap for a kiss...~
@52245 = ~He grabbed Vigilant Halasan's, um, behind. She broke his nose.~
@52246 = ~And he emptied two casks of ale we were saving for a victory celebration. If this happens again, he'll wind up in the stocks no matter WHO he knows.~
@52247 = ~Hah! Voghiln's vastness can be contained by no stockade! Do your wurst—I mean worst! See what happens!~
@52248 = ~Voghiln, your drinking is getting to be a problem. I can't have you around if you're going to keep losing control.~
@52249 = ~I like a drink as much as the next ten people, but you've got to cut back. I'm serious.~
@52250 = ~You're embarrassing yourself, skald. And you're embarrassing me. I won't have you travel with me in this state.~
@52251 = ~No, my friend, do not be so harsh! I still can help you on your journey, ja? Sit with Voghiln. Drink with me. I will tell you why last night happened. ~
@52252 = ~You've had more than enough to drink.~
@52253 = ~Drinking MORE will help nothing, Voghiln. Don't you get it?~
@52254 = ~I can't think of a single good reason to do such a thing.~
@52255 = ~Scale of the dragon, ja? It soothes the head. There is a table in the northeast of camp. By a well. We drink there.~
@52256 = ~Very well. Join me and we'll find a place to sit.~
@52257 = ~If that's what it'll take to get you to listen, let's go find this table.~
@52258 = ~I'll see you there in a few minutes.~
@52259 = ~I don't care what you have to say. I certainly have no interest in drinking with you.~
@52260 = ~I will!~
@52261 = ~Then we go!~
@52262 = ~So it is, then. So it will be.~
@52263 = ~By the Oak Father's parched throat, is there no ale in this wasteland? Wait, this cup has something in the bottom... Wine? Only one way to find out!~
@52264 = ~You wake up hungover and arrested and go right back to your cups. This is a problem.~
@52265 = ~Voghiln, stop. That's not sanitary.~
@52266 = ~You wanted to talk. Talk.~
@52267 = ~Ach, where is mine head? Here, my friend. I share my drink with you. Once you quaff with me, then we will talk.~
@52268 = ~I'm... honored, I supposed. Give me the cup.~

@52270 = ~If it will get you to talk faster, I'll drink.~
@52271 = ~This refusal, it harpoons my heart! This is a sign of great respect! How can I speak truthfully to someone who will not even share a drink with me?~
@52272 = ~Give me the cup.~
@52273 = ~Keep silent, then. I won't drink.~
@52274 = ~Our bond is severed before it is forged.~

@52276 = ~You drink NINE cups of ale every night? That's a lot.~
@52277 = ~Did you get a wizard to enchant your liver?~
@52278 = ~I'm sure there's a tedious tale behind your ritual.~
@52279 = ~Our bond is sealed. I drink to honor many such bonds. Nine drinks I must down each night, in memory of those passed on before me. It is a difficult ritual to uphold, but I do it gladly, in their names.~
@52280 = ~You've fought many battles, Voghiln. Why do these nine need remembering?~
@52281 = ~You enjoy this ritual a little too much, I fear. Who are the nine you drink to?~
@52282 = ~And what are their names?~
@52283 = ~It's enough that you know the reason for my excesses. I drink to honor their memories, ja?~
@52284 = ~You said we had a "bond" since I drank that disgusting liquid you offered me. Tell me of these people you honor, that I might also drink to their memory.~
@52285 = ~You're avoiding the subject. Why won't you tell me their names?~
@52286 = ~You didn't answer my question.~
@52287 = ~I know when someone trying to pull the wool over someone else's eyes when I see it, skald. And I'm looking at it right now.~
@52288 = ~I... I cannot tell you their names. I have forgotten. For over a year we traveled together. Then in one great battle, I lost nine brave companions. We all fought valiantly, but they died while I lived.~
@52289 = ~For over a year, we traveled together. Then in one great battle, I lost nine brave companions. We all fought valiantly, but they died while I lived.~

@52296 = ~I traveled the Sword Coast, finding solace in ale and the beautiful women. In time, I began to forget. I welcomed the forgetting—my pain went with it. Now all I have of my friends are memories shrouded in mist, like a Moonsea fog at dawn...~

@52298 = ~Getting falling-down drunk and winding up in the stocks is how you honor your friends' memory? That's madness.~

@52300 = ~I know! By all the gods above, I know. But this is all I have—what else can I do?~
@52301 = ~What if you constructed some sort of memorial?~
@52302 = ~You're a skald. Write an epic poem; immortalize them.~

@52315 = ~I heard about your talk with Voghiln, <CHARNAME>. Getting him to think about something other than wine and ale is a good idea. I've lost too many people to drink in my time. Anyway, I thought he might like to have these. What do you think?~
@52316 = ~What are they?~
@52317 = ~Are those earrings?~
@52318 = ~You'd give him your own jewelry? That's very kind.~
@52319 = ~These are pure silver earrings, given me by my friend Neoma. I don't wear them when I'm in uniform, but I carry them with me. Neoma's still alive, though. Voghiln's friends aren't. I don't think Neoma would mind me losing them if they were to help someone.~

@52338 = ~Let me see it... Ja, it seems very old. Look how smooth the wood has worn. And heavy as stone! It makes me think of someone—an elf who traveled with me.~
@52339 = ~There was an elf who traveled with me. I can remember her voice as she talked about the forests of her home. And her face, I remember her face.~
@52340 = ~I remember her voice as she talked about the forests of her home. I remember her face... Ondiasi was her name. A fine archer and better swordswoman. I'll keep this bit of tree to remember her by.~
@52341 = ~Nay, 'tis carved from walrus tusk—scrimshaw, they call it back home. A man from the north once fought at my side. We met him in Vaasa, and he joined our troop. He carved bits of bone into wondrous things—carved a bone drinking horn for himself!~
@52342 = ~We met him in Vaasa and he joined our troop. He called himself Wicuf and carried a bone drinking horn he crafted himself!~
@52343 = ~Wicuf, he called himself. Wicuf, I remember you now! I shall not forget you again with this scrimshaw in my pack!~
@52344 = ~Ja, most curious. All the same size, the same shape and sheen. Something about them recalls a memory... Three brothers traveled with me once. Born years apart, but they were alike as these pebbles.~
@52345 = ~There were brothers who traveled with me, three brothers. Born years apart, but they were alike as these pebbles.~
@52346 = ~Conal was the eldest, and Donal the middle. The youngest was... By my beard, let me think! Ah! Taig, that was he. These pebbles will serve as tokens to remind me of them always.~
@52347 = ~A fragile bauble, but see how it catches the light. It makes me think of the morning sun on the Great Glacier's icefields. Strange what memories are roused by such small trinkets...~
@52348 = ~Strange what memories arise from such small trinkets. The glimmering glass reminds me of a woman. Slender and sharp as an icicle, but with such a warmth about her.~
@52349 = ~The glimmering glass reminds me of a woman. Slender and sharp as an icicle, but with such a warmth about her. Beautiful, ja, and deadly with her magic! Zerihyda. Ah, Zerihyda, I shall not forget you again.~
@52350 = ~Bah! Southern poetry is so weak tea indeed! In the north, we sing rousing ballads fire and love to our women! Eh, perhaps this is not so bad. There is passion here. The writing has heart.~
@52351 = ~This is good stuff, though. Full of heart. It reminds me of a bard who traveled with me. He said one day he would immortalize us in song.~
@52352 = ~A bard once traveled at my side. He said he would immortalize our party in song. Poor lad, he died too young. No one shall remember his name. No one but Voghiln, from this day forth. And I write it on the flyleaf... "Evald."~
@52353 = ~The task is done, mine friend. I have the tokens here, one for each of my fallen companions.~
@52354 = ~I'm certain your comrades would be honored to be remembered this way.~
@52355 = ~Congratulations. Maybe now the rest of us will be able to get a sip of ale now and then.~
@52356 = ~Perhaps now we can turn our attention to our actual mission.~
@52357 = ~I could not have done this without you, <CHARNAME>. Before, I was a slave to my pain and the drink. Now when I raise a cup, it will be in gladness!~
@52358 = ~And I will raise a cup to toast your companions along with you!~
@52359 = ~Just don't raise TOO many cups. ~
@52360 = ~So long as you can keep up with me and fight when needed, do whatever you like.~
@52361 = ~I thank you the best way I know how—in an epic poem celebrating your great deeds. Ja, I start right away! But in case my words do not find favor with you, take this as well, with mine deepest thanks.~
@52362 = ~But in case an epic poem is not quite the reward for which you hoped, take this as well. With my deep and enduring thanks.~
@52363 = ~Here I am in the Nine Hells and still I have not found a token to remember my lost companions by. Perhaps I write an ode to memorialize this sorry state, ja?~
@52364 = ~Paralytic Bolt +1~
@52365 = ~Any target hit by this bolt must making a Saving Throw or be paralyzed for 5 rounds.

@52372 = ~Just make sure to stay on Ashatiel's good side.~
@52373 = ~That's easy for you to say, Beno.~
@52374 = ~Watch your step, Zagan. You want to stay on my good side too.~
@52375 = ~Oh, bind ME... <CHARNAME>, come here. We've got to get back to camp.~ [BD52375]
@52376 = ~Corwin? What's wrong?~
@52377 = ~All right, what am I missing here?~
@52378 = ~Go back? Explain yourself.~
@52379 = ~I don't think we really have the time to go over that right now.~ [BD52379]
@52380 = ~Where to begin?~ [BD52380]
@52381 = ~I just saw a face I'd hoped never to see again. That man over there, I killed him once. And then four more times. I don't want to talk about it.~ [BD52381]
@52382 = ~I see. Let's get out of here before he spots you.~
@52383 = ~You killed him five times? What could he possibly have done to deserve that?~
@52384 = ~You killed him five times and he isn't dead?~
@52385 = ~You slew a single man five times and you don't want to speak of it? Had I done such a thing, I'd speak of little else.~
@52386 = ~Got resurrected four times. When I slay someone, I prefer they remain dead.~
@52387 = ~Killing a man who doesn't stay dead is nothing to celebrate.~
@52388 = ~It's more a matter of what he didn't do.~
@52389 = ~I prefer to keep my personal life private.~
@52390 = ~It was a personal matter. And his family has powerful friends in the Lathanderian clergy, so I knew he wouldn't stay dead. Well, I didn't KNOW it, but hearing he's back has never surprised me.~
@52391 = ~I'd hoped our last meeting would stay our last. Let's just get out of here, before he recognizes me.~ [BD52391]
@52392 = ~Very well. But once we're clear of him, I want to speak to you about this.~
@52393 = ~No, no. Go talk to him. Say hello. You don't want to be rude.~
@52394 = ~You slew him five times already. What's one more?~
@52395 = ~Fine. Whatever. Let's go.~
@52396 = ~What I don't want is to have an entire camp looking to cut our throats, which is exactly what WILL happen if I try talking to that deceitful worm. Let's go.~
@52397 = ~This isn't the time or the place. Let's go.~
@52398 = ~Good plan. Let's go.~
@52399 = ~Fouleye's toady didn't lie.~ [BD52413]
@52400 = ~Is there anything here you can use?~
@52401 = ~Would've been nice if he'd mentioned the traps.~
@52402 = ~He was too afraid to lie.~
@52403 = ~Most goblins'd stop breathing before they'd stop lying.~ [BD52403]
@52404 = ~Might not've known about them. Doesn't matter now.~ [BD52404]
@52405 = ~Let's take a look.~ [BD52405]
@52406 = ~The traps're goblin work. I can tell.~ [BD52406]
@52407 = ~They just call attention to whatever it is they were trying to hide by protecting it thus.~
@52408 = ~They display a certain animal cunning.~
@52409 = ~Whatever they're hiding better be worth the effort.~
@52410 = ~Most goblins aren't that smart.~ [BD52410]
@52411 = ~More cunning than most goblins have.~ [BD52411]
@52412 = ~We'll see.~ [BD52412]
@52413 = ~Spiders only ate half this goblin. Stringy meat, we are.~
@52414 = ~I'll take your word for it. Is there anything on the body you can use?~
@52415 = ~Half eaten is still half too much, as far as I'm concerned.~
@52416 = ~Stringy meat can still be tasty.~
@52417 = ~There's always something you can use. Just don't always want to do what you can use if for.~ [BD52417]
@52418 = ~Take what you can use and let's go. I don't even know what we're doing here.~ [BD52418]
@52419 = ~Any meat tastes good if you're hungry enough.~ [BD52419]
@52420 = ~Depends who's eating and who's getting eaten. And how hungry the eater is.~ [BD52420]
@52421 = ~Ja. It's all about the spices.~ [BD52421]
@52422 = ~What's this?~ [BD52422]
@52423 = ~Fragments of the dwarven community that once lived here.~
@52424 = ~The spoils of war, spoiled by time. Many goblins died that these items could lie moldering in a dank and dreary cave. Will any of it fit you?~
@52425 = ~Those are shaman's robes, are they not? And a staff? And there, that armor was made for a goblin— Wait. There's something about it... an unnatural power radiating from the metal.~
@52426 = ~A big pile of junk.~
@52427 = ~Not all of it. These are goblin shaman robes. That staff too. Or that armor there. I couldn't do the summoning dance in it, but if it's as strong as it looks, might keep me alive.~
@52428 = ~Not all dwarf—there's things here I can use. Those are goblin shaman robes—that staff too. Or that armor. Couldn't do the summoning dance in it, but if it's as strong as it looks, it might keep me alive.~
@52429 = ~Don't touch me, vermin!~ [BD52429]
@52430 = ~Talking armor? That's new.~
@52431 = ~Vermin? That's a little harsh, don't you think?~
@52432 = ~The armor talks, and in a voice I don't care for. Destroy it.~
@52433 = ~Not good, but maybe good enough. Those are goblin shaman robes. That staff too. Or that armor. Couldn't do the summoning dance in it, but if it's as strong as it looks, it might keep me alive.~ [BD52433]
@52434 = ~Waste of energy. Let's take what we can use and begone.~
@52435 = ~Don't be so hasty. I might be able to use that. Speak to me, ghost. Who are you?~
@52436 = ~It happens. Talk, ghost. Who are you?~ [BD52436]
@52437 = ~I see it now too. Like it was trying to hide from me... I know you're there, ghost. Talk. Who are you?~ [BD52437]
@52438 = ~I know you're there, ghost. Speak to me now. Who are you?~
@52439 = ~Silence!~

@52441 = ~And a very good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you, Kruntur, lord of the dak'Dekanter.~
@52442 = ~Are you sure? You don't look like the lord of the dak'Dekanter clan. You look like a suit of armor.~
@52443 = ~You're a dekanter goblin? Be wary, M'Khiin. The dekanter are a cunning and vicious strain of your kind.~
@52444 = ~A dekanter goblin. More cunning—and vicious—than the common breed. You would do well to listen to this Kruntur, M'Khiin. He may teach you something.~
@52445 = ~I've no time to waste on this nonsense. M'Khiin, take what you can use, but do it quickly.~
@52446 = ~What world is mine, flesh or ghost? Can't live in both, not anymore, got to pick—shaman or warrior, robes or armor. Don't know, don't know...~ [BD52446]
@52447 = ~More goblin warriors die than any other race I can think of. Armor rarely helps them. Your gifts are more spiritual than physical. I'd seriously consider taking the robes and staff.~
@52448 = ~You are many things, M'Khiin, but indecisive is not one of them. Make your choice.~
@52449 = ~We'll have an eternity in the spirit realms soon enough. Take the armor, M'Khiin. Become a warrior.~
@52450 = ~You're right, <CHARNAME>. I will do as you say.~ [BD52450]
@52451 = ~This vexatious varmint is vicious enough for my tastes.~ [BD52451]
@52452 = ~Anything he could teach me I learned long ago at the hands of my father. Kruntur, how did you come to be here?~ [BD52452]
@52453 = ~You mock me, <PRO_RACE>?~ [BD52453]
@52454 = ~Forget them. Talk to me. How is it you're here, Kruntur dak'Dekanter?~ [BD52454]
@52455 = ~I died. But I'm not leaving my armor, oh no. It's mine—MINE! No one else's!~ [BD52455]
@52456 = ~My friend could use armor like this.~
@52457 = ~It's M'Khiin's now.~
@52458 = ~See, now I've pretty much GOT to give your armor to my friend here.~
@52459 = ~We shall see. The decision is yours, M'Khiin. This armor's superior to what you've got in every way but the obvious one.~
@52460 = ~He's a ghost. A whisper. Nothing to fear.~ [BD52460]
@52461 = ~Nothing to fear? I am Kruntur dak'Dekanter! Claw lord! War chief of my clan!~ [BD52461]
@52462 = ~And it means nothing in the end. Can you hurt anything but my ears, anything at all? Tell me.~ [BD52462]
@52463 = ~WHAT?! You would foul my armor with this—female? NEVER! I won't allow it!~ [BD52463]
@52464 = ~She will wear it or not, as she desires.~
@52465 = ~Can you stop it?~
@52466 = ~I'll do as I wish, and I see nothing you can do to stop me. You must use the armor, M'Khiin. Its advantages more than make up for Kruntur's bellowing.~
@52467 = ~I'll crush your bones to powder! Drink your blood like wine! I'll suck her soul out of her body and cast it down in the bonelands forever!~ [BD52467]
@52468 = ~That means "no."~ [BD52468]
@52469 = ~The decision is yours, M'Khiin. This armor is superior to yours, but the cost is high... You'd exchange your dance's gifts for Kruntur's company.~
@52470 = ~The armor's quite good, in every way but the obvious one. I doubt I could stand to wear it, but I'll not keep you from being better able to defend yourself.~
@52471 = ~This armor is superior to any you have worn before. You must use it. Kruntur's bellowing is a small price to pay for what it offers.~
@52472 = ~Dance and ghostsong mean little outside the tribe. This is a world of fist and steel.~ [BD52472]
@52473 = ~Take it off! Remove the armor now!~ [BD52473]
@52474 = ~Quiet, you bellowing k'taarn! Be silent or I'll throw this armor down that crack and none will hear your wretched voice ever again.~ [BD52474]
@52475 = ~You wouldn't dare.~ [BD52475]
@52476 = ~She would dare.~ [BD52476]
@52477 = ~If she doesn't, I will.~
@52478 = ~Keep talking, dekanter. See where you end up.~ [BD52478]
@52479 = ~Eh. I've nothing more to say to you anyway.~
@52480 = ~The voices of the dead sing to me. I've known too many like Kruntur in my life. No more, not if I've a choice.~ [BD52480]
@52481 = ~Hah! The female fears me, and well she should!~ [BD52481]
@52482 = ~Back, stand back! I am a witch of the east. The blood of seven dragons runs through my veins! I breathe underwater, and the stars are jewels for my hair!~ [BD52482]
@52483 = ~Stop where thou art. I well know how to use my sword and am sworn to defend Julann.~ [BD52483]
@52484 = ~Fear not, friend—I've no quarrel with you. I am <CHARNAME>. Who are you?~
@52485 = ~Easy there, big guy. I don't want to hurt you, whoever you are. But I want you to hurt me even less.~
@52486 = ~Raise that sword to me and your life is over, stranger.~
@52487 = ~HE is Rigah, my strong and faithful bodyguard. I am Julann, wychlaran of Rashemen and heir to the Thrice-Burned Castle, once I find it.~ [BD52487]
@52488 = ~Some say the Thrice-Burned Castle is a myth, but if that were so, why would I dream of it every fortnight, hmm? Answer me that!~ [BD52488]
@52489 = ~Uh... I'm not sure. Did you say you were a witch?~
@52490 = ~Would that I could. But wait—am I to understand that you're a witch?~
@52491 = ~I have no answer for you. Perhaps there is such a place as the one that haunts your dreams—stranger things happen in this land.~
@52492 = ~Did you hear that, Rigah? Finally, we meet one who appreciates my wisdom! Not like the butterflies. They respect me, but they're such frivolous things, really.~ [BD52492]
@52493 = ~But I am here, yes! Brave Minsc and his not-quite-as-brave but much cleverer miniature giant space hamster, Boo!~ [BD52493]
@52494 = ~My witch, Dynaheir, she... she is not with us. For the moment. But Boo says to be brave and carry on till she returns!~ [BD52494]
@52495 = ~Your hamster speaks with wisdom. I greatly desire to speak with another sister of Rashemen! Should you find her, could you bring her to me? In a speaking state, naturally.~ [BD52495]
@52496 = ~I am Dynaheir of the wychlaran of Rashemen. My guard, Minsc, of the Ice Dragon Berserker Lodge, is not now with us. His bravery ofttimes overwhelms his good sense, and he rushes too quickly into battle.~ [BD52496]
@52497 = ~His bravery sometimes overwhelms his good sense and he rushes too-quickly into battle. ~
@52498 = ~I would like to speak to a brother from the lodge. Should he return to thee, bring him to me, I beseech thee.~ [BD52498]
@52499 = ~Unless you foresee a problem with introducing us?~ [BD52499]
@52500 = ~Neither of my companions are... able to speak, at the moment.~
@52501 = ~It wasn't easy getting a coherent conversation out of Minsc even when he was upright. It's harder still with him dead.~
@52502 = ~Minsc is a fool who never knew when to leave a battle. This time his foolishness cost Dynaheir her life as well.~
@52503 = ~Loosen their tongues, then, and bring them to us! We should like to speak to both of them.~ [BD52503]
@52504 = ~I trust this is the type of death from which one can return? Powerful are the magics of our realm, though not infalliable.~
@52505 = ~If their spirits should return to their bodies, please bring them to us. I've many questions about the afterlife. Rigah refuses to let me die even a little bit to get a peek at what awaits us all at journey's end.~ [BD52505]
@52506 = ~We are here. I am Dynaheir, wychlaran of Rashemen and traveler like thyself. This is Minsc, my bodyguard, of the Ice Dragon Berserker Lodge.~ [BD52506]
@52507 = ~You are SO familiar. Didn't we meet in the moonlight once?~ [BD52507]
@52508 = ~I think you have confused me with someone else.~
@52509 = ~We just met. About five minutes ago.~
@52510 = ~I think I'd better be going.~
@52511 = ~Mutual, I'm sure.~ [BD52511]
@52512 = ~Yes, of course. Naturally.~ [BD52512]
@52513 = ~Hast we been introduced? I am Dynaheir, wychlaran of Rashemen. This is my bodyguard, Minsc, of the Ice Dragon Berserker Lodge.~ [BD52513]
@52514 = ~Boo and I are very pleased to meet you! Say well met, Boo. Boo says, "Well met, Boo!" Such a jester this hamster is.~ [BD52514]
@52515 = ~Splendid, splendid! What a fortunate thing I followed the wind. Rigah said it was madness, especially when we climbed down that cliff and then jumped off that other cliff, but I KNEW it was the right direction.~ [BD52515]
@52516 = ~I would like to stay and talk to thee, mine sister. It has been too long since I spoke with another from our land, save for Minsc.~ [BD52516]
@52517 = ~I would LOVE that, truly I would! Talking to ordinary people is like talking to rabbits sometimes, don't you agree? ~
@52518 = ~I would LOVE that, truly! Talking to ordinary folk is like talking to rabbits sometimes, don't you agree? ENOUGH WITH THE LETTUCE! But Rigah and I must be ready to move with the crusade. We may not have long to chat.~ [BD52518]
@52519 = ~You follow Caelar Argent?~
@52520 = ~Wait, you're telling me you've joined the bloody crusade?~
@52521 = ~Crusaders! All who follow the Shining Lady shall die at my hand!~
@52522 = ~Not precisely. That is, we might be. We're testing it out in a manner of speaking. Seeing what they have to offer.~ [BD52522]
@52523 = ~What they have to offer? The Shining Lady offers naught but madness and delusion! How canst thou consider joining her?~ [BD52523]
@52524 = ~Well, I'll tell you how it came about. We left Rashemen searching for the child of Bhaal, as foretold in the prophecies of the great Alaundo. We heard rumors of a being of divine power in the vicinity, and so our search brought us here.~ [BD52524]
@52525 = ~It turned out to be an eccentric hedge mage, nothing more, though he DID invite us to stay for tea and we had rather a dear time. ~
@52526 = ~This supposed spawn of Bhaal turned out to be nothing more than an eccentric hedge mage, but he DID invite us to stay for tea. After that, we continued exploring the area and encountered the crusade.~ [BD52526]
@52527 = ~Why have you joined with the crusade?~
@52528 = ~Caelar may believe her cause righteous, but her followers' actions have been anything but. You'd be well-advised to break ties with them.~
@52529 = ~If you're a crusader, you're my enemy and must die.~
@52530 = ~No! No, no, no, no, no, no, not in the least. One of Caelar's lieutenants, Hephernaan his name is, made us a very attractive offer, though.~ [BD52530]
@52531 = ~The crusade's face seems attractive enough, but beneath they are foul as serpents. Do not be fooled, sister.~ [BD52531]
@52532 = ~Hephernaan has a wee inner circle of arcane practitioners. If we join him, he'll share his knowledge with us! Lovely of him, that's what I say.~ [BD52532]
@52533 = ~So you're part of the crusade now?~
@52534 = ~The crusade is not a righteous organization. I strongly advise you to break ties with them.~
@52535 = ~If you're a crusader, you're my enemy and must die.~
@52536 = ~I've seen no evidence of evil or corruption. If I do, I'll certainly rethink my association with the movement.~ [BD52536]
@52537 = ~Thou must trust a sister wychlaran, Julann. The crusade is not what it seems. It has torn this land asunder!~ [BD52537]
@52538 = ~This land, perhaps, but Rashemen is safe. Were that not the case, it would make a difference, but I don't see how skirmishes up the Sword Coast affect us.~ [BD52538]
@52539 = ~The crusade's leaders are corrupt and dishonest. They lead their followers to destruction.~
@52540 = ~That's not exactly... never mind. I shall find proof of the crusade's corruption, hard evidence. Then I shall return to show you your error.~
@52541 = ~I fail to see how this concerns me. This is not my land. I have little power here and am not one to interfere with politics regardless.~ [BD52541]
@52542 = ~I cannot believe what I am hearing. <CHARNAME>. Thou must help mine fellow witch. We need proof of the crusade's villainy and soon, lest she pledge her power in service to the Shining Lady.~ [BD52542]
@52543 = ~I appreciate your interest in me, truly. You're so enthusiastic! But my mind as made up as ever it gets. Which is often "not very," but in this case is "VERY."~
@52544 = ~I'm quite certain you'll find nothing but cobwebs in the crusade's closets—no skeletons of scandal there. But do as you will. Take care now!~ [BD52544]
@52545 = ~Oh, my stars! For once, Rigah was right to threaten a stranger! Bodyguard! Guard my body!~ [BD52545]
@52546 = ~Keep thy distance. My witch trusts strangers—I am more cautious.~ [BD52546]
@52547 = ~A sound philosophy, but I assure you I mean you no harm.~
@52548 = ~That's sensible, which makes me wonder why you're saying it. My berserker friend, Minsc, would never speak thus.~
@52549 = ~I don't trust you either.~
@52550 = ~Then thou understandest me.~ [BD52550]
@52551 = ~It is good to see another brother from the east! Minsc has been long in this foreign land where the evil is thick and the people are tiny.~ [BD52551]
@52552 = ~Agreed. I've been too long away from our people.~ [BD52552]
@52553 = ~How long have you been on your dajemma?~
@52554 = ~If you're looking to Minsc for conversation, you might want to get comfortable. Understanding him can take a while.~
@52555 = ~Talk with Minsc if you must, but be quick about it. We've important work to do.~
@52556 = ~Too long. When I left the place of my birth, I looked forward to seeing new lands, meeting new people. I have been gone years now, though, with nary a glimpse of home.~ [BD52556]
@52557 = ~I too know the loneliness of living in strange, smelly lands. Luckily, I have Boo and my witch for company.~ [BD52557]
@52558 = ~I too know the loneliness of living in a strange, smelly land. But Minsc has Boo for company. And my witch... perhaps she will return someday. Boo says such things happen.~ [BD52558]
@52559 = ~I have no "Boo," whatever creature that may be. But I do have a witch. Oh yes. I have a witch.~ [BD52559]
@52560 = ~It sounds like you've a tale to tell.~
@52561 = ~You and Minsc will have much to discuss.~
@52562 = ~Perhaps we'll chat more another time. For now, we need to keep moving.~
@52563 = ~Your berserker friend can be no harder to understand than my witch, Julann. She hath a unique mind.~ [BD52563]
@52564 = ~Dynaheir too has a mind unlike any other. Her brilliance makes Minsc's brain feel like a hamster's! Boo does not like it when Minsc says so, so I do not say it very loud.~ [BD52564]
@52565 = ~Dynaheir too had a mind unlike any other. Her brilliance made Minsc's brain feel like a hamster's! Not like Boo's brain, though. Ho ho, Minsc should be so lucky as to have a brain like that.~ [BD52565]
@52566 = ~I thought I would learn from my witch—that she would guide me as I protected her. But each day is more confusing than the last.~ [BD52566]
@52567 = ~I want more than his conversation. I was hoping for his advice. For years, I have followed every one of Julann's orders, indulged her every whim even as we roamed further and further from home.~ [BD52567]
@52568 = ~Wait! I do not want to make simple talk with your berserker—I seek his counsel. For years, I have followed every one of Julann's whims, obeyed her every order. For years, we have roamed farther and farther from Rashemen.~ [BD52568]
@52569 = ~For years now I have followed every one of Julann's whims, obeyed her every wish, and for years we have roamed further and further from home.~
@52570 = ~I despair of ever seeing my homeland again. How do you do it, brother Minsc? How do you endure the random caprices of your witch?~ [BD52570]
@52571 = ~I'm afraid you'll not get help on this from Minsc, Rigah. He is utterly devoted to Dynaheir.~
@52572 = ~You should know, Rigah, that when it comes to my Rashemi friends, Dynaheir is the more stable of the two, by far.~
@52573 = ~You are on a fool's errand. Dynaheir is as predictable as the mountains.~
@52574 = ~Can it be so? Not all witches are as flighty and irrepressible as my witch?~ [BD52574]
@52575 = ~Minsc will follow Dynaheir to the ends of Toril, though his legs may be very sore! If she sails away, he will follow her! Preferably in the boat, but Minsc can swim.~ [BD52575]
@52576 = ~Minsc would have followed Dynaheir to the end of Toril and beyond. I would have followed her into death, but she would not like that. So Minsc waits, and hopes she will return.~ [BD52576]
@52577 = ~I... I see. Then I am truly alone.~ [BD52577]
@52578 = ~Untrue. Without you, Rigah, Julann would be utterly lost. You're the only stable thing in her life.~
@52579 = ~You're not alone, Rigah. The wisdom and strength of your lodge is behind you. You were given this dajemma because you were best suited to protect Julann. Take pride in that.~
@52580 = ~I know something about battle and fighting terrible enemies to protect your allies. You were chosen to protect Julann because your'e the strongest. It is an honorable mission.~
@52581 = ~Yes, you are. Continue blindly following your witch and things will only get worse.~
@52582 = ~I've no time for your pathetic mewling. Figure this out and get on with your life.~
@52583 = ~That is one way to look at things.~ [BD52583]
@52584 = ~You are Julann's protector. She wouldn't last an hour without your guidance. She needs you—your wisdom, your skill, and above all, your patience.~
@52585 = ~Thou speakest true. I keep Julann safe. As long as she is in the world, I will protect her. Thank you. Thou hast cleared the fog from my mind.~ [BD52585]
@52586 = ~What art thou saying?~ [BD52586]
@52587 = ~Julann is leading you astray. Follow her and your dajemma will last forever. You'll never see your home again while she lives.~
@52588 = ~Perhaps thou art correct. I should resign myself to this life. I can have no other.~ [BD52588]
@52589 = ~Of course. Apologies for taking up so much of thy time.~ [BD52589]
@52590 = ~I wonder if birds ever die of old age while they're flying and fall RIGHT out of the sky?~ [BD52590]
@52591 = ~I've something here you need to see, Julann.~
@52592 = ~I can't say I've ever thought about it. Or, in truth, that I intend to begin thinking about it now.~
@52593 = ~Right. I'm now going to wear a helmet every time I step outside. Thank you so much for that.~
@52594 = ~A ridiculous question. What do you think they'd do, hover?~
@52595 = ~Hmmmm.~ [BD52595]
@52596 = ~Where is that nice witch of yours? I was so enjoying speaking to her.~ [BD52596]
@52597 = ~I'm afraid she's not here right now.~
@52598 = ~We ran into some trouble underground. The stabby kind. Don't worry, we'll fix her up.~
@52599 = ~She's dead. Let's speak of other things.~
@52600 = ~Thou allowed thy witch to fall? Shameful. Thou shouldst do whatever it takes to restore her to life.~ [BD52600]
@52601 = ~I know it's inconvenient, monetarily and otherwise, but I would so appreciate being able to speak to her again. It would set my mind at ease, and that generally takes a LOT of effort.~ [BD52601]
@52602 = ~I don't have time to bring her to you. You need to see this evidence now.~
@52603 = ~I'll return when she's able to speak to you.~
@52604 = ~I really think she should be, don't you? Not that I don't trust you, but you know what fish say. "Better the pond you know than the lake you don't."~ [BD52604]
@52605 = ~I agree. That is the best course of action.~ [BD52605]
@52606 = ~What is this?~ [BD52606]
@52607 = ~Notes from a ritual designed by Hephernaan. He sought to raise an undead army.~
@52608 = ~Proof of the crusade's corruption.~
@52609 = ~Papers that clearly show how foolish you were to trust anything Caelar has to say.~
@52610 = ~What...? No! I don't believe it.~ [BD52610]
@52611 = ~You must, mine sister. The evidence is here before thine eyes.~ [BD52611]
@52612 = ~Anyone could have written these papers. A squirrel, even! I met a talking squirrel in a taproom once; it could happen!~ [BD52612]
@52613 = ~You grasp at reasons to dismiss the proof before your eyes. Help me, here, Rigah. Please.~
@52614 = ~She's mad. Rigah. See how corrupt your witch has become, consorting with necromancers!~
@52615 = ~Dynaheir sees the truth in these pages. If another wychlaran's word cannot convince you, nothing will.~
@52616 = ~Dynaheir agrees with my accounting of the ritual. Think! What would I gain from such an elaborate ruse?~
@52617 = ~I am a fellow wizard. Trust me when I say, the logic of the situation points toward the crusade's corruption. You can't believe Hephernaan.~
@52618 = ~I may not belong to the Ice Dragon lodge, but I understand honor. I would not bring you false evidence.~
@52619 = ~It could, but it's unlikely. These papers show the truth.~
@52620 = ~Try and think rationally. I saw the ritual performed! What would I gain from lying to you?~
@52621 = ~You clearly have no interest in the truth. I'm done with you.~
@52622 = ~Julann, you must trust this one. The other witch and her berserker trusted them, and so do I.~ [BD52622]
@52623 = ~Yes, we Rashemi must stand together! Not too close together, though. Minsc has a wide swing.~ [BD52623]
@52624 = ~I pray thee, Julann, trust this man as I do. I tell thee, he speaks the truth.~ [BD52624]
@52625 = ~I pray thee, Julann, trust this woman as I do; her evidence is sound.~ [BD52625]
@52626 = ~Of course you're correct, my little beetles. What was I thinking, I don't know, truly. We shall leave this place at once, Rigah.~ [BD52626]
@52627 = ~Perhaps you should revisit Rashemen and receive some guidance for your travels.~
@52628 = ~Luck to you on your travels. I hope you won't need it, but a little luck's never hurt anyone.~
@52629 = ~Finally, I can turn my attention back where it belongs.~
@52630 = ~I do miss our home. What do you say, Rigah? Shall we visit Rashemen once more?~ [BD52630]
@52631 = ~If that is thy wish, lady.~ [BD52631]
@52632 = ~Onward, then! Thank you again, dear ones. Do take this as thanks; Rigah has a splendid new weapon, and we've been lugging this one around for weeks. Think of me when thou look'st upon it. Not that thou wouldst forget, I am sure.~ [BD52632]
@52633 = ~Not that thy wouldst forget.~
@52634 = ~Yes. Yes, I see it now. Her madness hath grown unchecked.~ [BD52634]
@52635 = ~Do not do this, Rigah! We can still make her see reason!~ [BD52635]
@52636 = ~What are you saying, Rigah?~ [BD52636]
@52637 = ~Your refusal to see the evil you are in league with can mean but one thing: You must be destroyed.~
@52638 = ~Rigah will indulge your foolishness no longer. His dajemma ends here.~
@52639 = ~I knew from the start you were my enemy. Now you will suffer the same fate as all who stand against me.~
@52640 = ~This cannot be!~ [BD52640]
@52641 = ~Your proof is flimsy as a frog's eyelid. Away with you! I'll not be tricked into abandoning my new allies.~ [BD52641]
@52642 = ~If there's nothing else I can do to convince you, then be on your way.~
@52643 = ~Any ally of the crusade is an enemy of mine. ~
@52644 = ~Come, Rigah. We leave immediately for Dragonspear Castle.~ [BD52644]
@52645 = ~I cannot be believing my ears! Surely Minsc's good friend would not do such evil things!~ [BD52645]
@52646 = ~Bodyguard! Guard my body!~ [BD52646]
@52647 = ~Thou didst leave me with much to think on. I would be alone for a time to ponder thy words.~
@52648 = ~What have I done...? How did I come to be this—this monster?~ [BD52648]
@52649 = ~You are no monster, Rigah. You kept Julann from destroying countless lives in the crusade's service.~
@52650 = ~The only monster here was Julann. She got what she deserved, and now you will too—you can finally return home.~
@52651 = ~It takes courage to do what has to be done. You showed it here this <DAYNIGHTALL>. I respect that.~
@52652 = ~Perhaps... perhaps thou art right. I will return to Rashemen and confess my deeds. The Lodge will set my punishment.~ [BD52652]
@52653 = ~Minsc knows what punishment HE would deal out, and it would be more than a stern butt-kicking!~ [BD52653]
@52654 = ~Thou helped me when I was in turmoil. Here, take this as a symbol of my thanks. I suspect I will need it no longer.~ [BD52654]
@52655 = ~The crusade has left a trail of destruction in its wake. You cannot stand by and let such injustice continue.~
@52656 = ~Most leaders do, my pigeon. Does the scarecrow speak truth unto the birdseed concealed in its hat? I think not.~ [BD52656]
@52657 = ~I see. If I find evidence of the crusade's corruption, though, I will return.~
@52658 = ~You want to head out again?~
@52659 = ~I do. If it's all right with you, of course.~
@52660 = ~What can I say? I'm a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of the people.~
@52661 = ~If that's a problem for you, feel free to remain here.~
@52662 = ~Stay close. The streets are shoulder to shoulder with people. It's a cutpurse's dream out there—and an assassin's.~
@52663 = ~Let's go find the ones who aren't, then.~
@52664 = ~I'm ready to leave now.~
@52665 = ~So what are my options?~
@52666 = ~What I'd really like to know is where all my gold went.~
@52667 = ~Captain Corwin of the Flaming Fist knows where several people who might assist me can be found. She will escort me to their locations around the city.~
@52668 = ~Very well.~
@52669 = ~Where are Dynaheir and Minsc?~
@52670 = ~Do you need a drink? I need a drink. Join me for a drink.~
@52671 = ~Do that.~
@52672 = ~When you leave, don't move too far ahead of me. If I lose you in the crowd, Duke Eltan will have my head.~
@52673 = ~They've got a room on the third floor, or so I've been told.~
@52674 = ~I like the way you think. Let's go.~
@52675 = ~I got what I came for, but I could use a drink. How about you?~
@52676 = ~I need a drink. You?~
@52677 = ~When I'm finished, I'll tell you. Do not ask me again.~
@52678 = ~It will probably be a dreadfully boring trip, but our friend wants to take no chances on something exciting happening.~ [BD52678]
@52679 = ~Fare thee well, then, whatever thy plans for the future are.~ [BD52679]
@52680 = ~I've changed my mind, Dynaheir. On reflection, I believe I could use your and Minsc's assistance in my quest.~
@52681 = ~Stone Dowser~
@52682 = ~This amulet, in the shape of an elemental's eye, is designed to lead its user to a weak point in Toril's surface.

@52683 = ~The... "Bwoosh!"... is distilled explosive concentrate. Planted in the right spot under Dragonspear, it could give us a major advantage when we move against the castle.~
@52684 = ~You want me to carry a barrel of potion of explosion under Dragonspear?~
@52685 = ~"Bwoosh!"?~
@52686 = ~I'm going to assume "Bwoosh!" means what I think it means and say yes, I'll do it.~
@52687 = ~It's not a barrel of potion of explosion, it WAS a barrel of potion of explosion—a dozen barrels actually, the ones you stopped from blowing Boareskyr Bridge, <CHARNAME>. NOW it's a barrel of Bwoosh! BWOOSH! It's fun and easier to say. What's not to love?~
@52688 = ~All right, here it is. One barrel of the most explosive material this side of—what's the nearest volcano?~
@52689 = ~Whatever. Doesn't matter. What matters is, the material will remain inert until one of our warmages recites the right incantation to detonate it. So you shouldn't be blowing yourself up while you're down there unless I really messed up.~
@52690 = ~Don't worry. In my entire life, I've only messed up once. This year. So take it, keep it safe, hide it where it'll hurt the crusade worst, and when you get back... Bwoosh! All right? Good.~
@52691 = ~You have my thanks, my lady.~
@52692 = ~But no bwoosh until I return, right?~
@52693 = ~Very well. I will do as you ask. Farewell.~
@52694 = ~WAIT!~
@52695 = ~When you're inside the caverns, consult this amulet each time you come to an intersection. It will guide you to the best placement for the barrel. Now, Phossey, would you please excuse us?~ [BD52695]
@52696 = ~Potion of Explosions sounds like pretentious twaddle. Much easier AND more satisfying to call it a potion of Bwoosh! ANYway, here it is. One barrel of the most explosive material this side of—what's the nearest volcano?~
@52697 = ~That's it. You can go now.~
@52698 = ~Naw, naw. No chance of that. Unless something goes wrong. I'd place the barrel soon as I could, if I were you. Just to be on the safe side. All right, off with you.~
@52699 = ~She's right. It is.~
@52700 = ~Tell me, how often do you "mess up"?~
@52701 = ~Yes, yes, we get the idea. I have reservations, <CHARNAME>. This is highly explosive materiel. How are we to trust this monkey has made it safe for transport?~
@52702 = ~We'll do our best to follow your advice, <CHARNAME>. With each of us encouraging the other, we may be able to prevent another manifestation.~

@52710 = ~Tell me about yourself.~
@52711 = ~What can you tell me about this place?~
@52712 = ~You're in luck! We have drinks here. ~
@52713 = ~Who, me? There's not much to tell. The inn needed someone to run the taps and I needed a few extra coins in my pocket.~
@52714 = ~Who, me? There's not much to tell. The inn needed someone to run the taps, and I needed some coin in my pocket. My man's a sailor, so he's gone for weeks at a time. This keeps me busy and lets me talk to people.~
@52715 = ~I'd like a drink now.~
@52716 = ~You must get lonely from time to time.~
@52717 = ~What can you tell me about this inn?~
@52718 = ~I have to be going now.~
@52719 = ~The Three Old Kegs is one of the oldest inns in Baldur's Gate. Never thought I'd be working somewhere so fancy! Nantrin Bellowglym runs the place. ~
@52720 = ~Interesting. I'd like a drink now, please.~
@52721 = ~Tell me about yourself.~
@52722 = ~I have to be going now.~
@52723 = ~I don't want to hear that kind of talk, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. My man's at sea as often as not, but I'm happy with him all the same. Now do you want a drink or not?~
@52724 = ~Go on, you! I'm happy with my man, flatter me though you will. Now can I get your charming self a drink?~
@52725 = ~A good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you.~
@52726 = ~As you wish.~
@52727 = ~Who am I here to find, again?~
@52728 = ~You're not much of a bodyguard, are you?~
@52729 = ~Call if you need me.~
@52730 = ~I was told to get you where you wanted to go and I have. What you do now is your own business. If you need me, you know where to find me.~
@52731 = ~A bard named Garrick. Though why a bard would spend time here is beyond me. House rules discourage singing—at least by those of Garrick's ilk.~
@52732 = ~There's also Safana and Coran, a pair of unsavory characters staying upstairs Belt thinks might be of use. Why he'd think that, I don't know, but it's not my place to argue with a Grand Duke.~
@52733 = ~Done?~
@52734 = ~Let's go.~
@52735 = ~Garrick. A pretty boy with an empty head, I've heard. Which would explain what he's doing in a place where he won't be allowed to perform.~
@52736 = ~Aye, a pair of cutpurses named Safana and Coran.~
@52737 = ~Well, when you are ready to go, just head out. I'll follow you.~
@52738 = ~If I'm understanding you correctly—and I think I am—what you're trying to say here is that you're done? Yes? Then let's go.~
@52739 = ~Who am I looking for here again? A bard, was it?~
@52740 = ~Who exactly am I supposed to find here? A couple of thieves, is that right?~
@52741 = ~It's not been so long since we ventured together, has it, Garrick?~
@52742 = ~It's possible—I am <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate. But I don't recognize you.~
@52743 = ~Recognize me if you must, but do not speak to me.~
@52744 = ~Well allow me to change that! I am Garrick. A performer of no little renown, though the house rules regrettably prevent me from properly exhibiting my talents. Please join me.~
@52745 = ~You're in a tavern, friend. People speak to each other in taverns. But I can tell you prefer they not speak to you, and I shall honor your wish. Farewell.~
@52746 = ~The same two feet that will carry me away from this pointless conversation.~
@52747 = ~If you wish to insult me, you'll have to do better than that. I've developed rather a thick skin of late. Fare thee well.~
@52748 = ~Which isn't to suggest it's actually good...~ [BD52748]
@52749 = ~Do you know any songs about hamsters? I'm asking for a friend.~ [BD52749]
@52750 = ~Is it true an elven maid's ghost sometimes fills this place with song?~ [BD52750]
@52751 = ~It is true, more's the pity. It's her song and her song alone that patrons here are allowed to enjoy.~
@52752 = ~Then why art thou here at all?~ [BD52752]
@52753 = ~The answer to that is simple enough...~
@52754 = ~Gods, will this story ever end? Here, let me help you get to the point: The only person allowed to sing in the Elfsong tavern is the ghost of the elf for which it's named. Which makes it a place sensible bards tend to avoid.~ [BD52754]
@52755 = ~Do you really need to ask?~ [BD52755]
@52756 = ~It can actually be rather enjoyable—depending on who's doing the unrequiting.~ [BD52756]
@52757 = ~Thou hast a lump of coal where thy heart should be. I'm sure of it.~ [BD52757]
@52758 = ~Coming around is one of my favorite things! It was after a glorious battle that I came around and discovered Boo, nibbling on my provisions as he anxiously waited for me to awake. That was a good day.~ [BD52758]
@52759 = ~Ale for me. And a bowl of water for my hamster.~ [BD52759]
@52760 = ~Is that some sort of euphem— No, I see you've actually got a hamster. I'll fetch your drinks.~
@52761 = ~There is nothing there to admire. Women—real women, not the farcical creatures who exist in your fanciful tales of "romance"—like nothing better than being taken at their word. A courteous man bows and walks away from a woman who's not interested.~ [BD52761]
@52762 = ~With respect, milady, I am well aware what women like. Artists often face rejection. It takes more than a simple "no" to discourage us.~
@52763 = ~Come, <CHARNAME>, let us take our leave of this lovestruck dullard. Or better still, let's bide a time and see him struck by something less abstract in nature. Like a frying pan.~ [BD52763]
@52764 = ~Dost thou believe her a god's spawn? Could she be a child of Bhaal?~ [BD52764]
@52765 = ~Do you know what I like about you, <CHARNAME>? There must be SOMEthing—I'd not wander the Flaming Fist's headquarters for most people.~ [BD52765]
@52766 = ~Oh. You've brought me to a jail. You have the soul of a romantic, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD52766]
@52767 = ~Talk to the madman yet?~
@52768 = ~That's one way to put it.~
@52769 = ~Less "talked" than "got bellowed at by."~
@52770 = ~Yes. But I'd like to poke around here a bit more, if that's all right.~
@52771 = ~I believe we're done here.~
@52772 = ~No, not yet.~
@52773 = ~I won't ask. Don't need to—I could hear most of it from here. Shall we go?~
@52774 = ~Let's. The sooner I put this place behind me, the better.~
@52775 = ~I'd like to look around here a bit more, if that's all right.~
@52776 = ~Not quite yet.~
@52777 = ~You're an odd duck, <CHARNAME>. But suit yourself. I'll follow you out once you're done here.~
@52778 = ~It's no Ducal Palace, is it? Let's go.~
@52779 = ~Let's go.~
@52780 = ~Well, do what you're going to do. We've more useful places than this to be.~
@52781 = ~Yeah, I heard most of it. You ready to go?~
@52782 = ~I'm finished here.~
@52783 = ~I'm going to poke around here a bit more first.~
@52784 = ~Not quite yet.~
@52785 = ~Are you sure, little loud man? It LOOKS like a cell...~ [BD52785]
@52786 = ~Thou art realizing this only now...?~ [BD52786]
@52787 = ~Well, that was time well spent.~ [BD52787]
@52788 = ~In wonder I can believe, but glory? Thou think'st too highly of thyself, gnome.~ [BD52788]
@52789 = ~Aw, he wants to go beddy bye. That's adorable.~ [BD52789]
@52790 = ~A noble gesture. ~
@52791 = ~What am I looking for here?~
@52792 = ~A waste of resources better spent preparing for battle with Caelar. ~
@52793 = ~The Grand Dukes thought so. The day-to-day operations are handled by priests and monks of different faiths.~
@52794 = ~I'll be here if you need me. Try not to get into any trouble. ~
@52795 = ~A Selûnite monk named Rasaad yn Bashir. He's helping care for the refugees.~
@52796 = ~The streets are crowded enough. If refugees staying here makes it easier for the Fist out there... well, this building has been put to worse uses.~
@52797 = ~Done what you came to do? ~
@52798 = ~The monk has other things on his mind right now. He won't be joining us.~
@52799 = ~For all the good it did. ~
@52800 = ~Yes, but bide a time. I wish to see more of this place. ~
@52801 = ~Bide a time. I would see more of this place. ~
@52802 = ~No, not yet. ~
@52803 = ~I'm finished here. ~
@52804 = ~Sometimes things go your way, sometimes they don't. Such is life. ~
@52805 = ~Must be a lot of memories here for you. Take your time. If you need me, you know where to find me. ~
@52806 = ~Let's go. ~
@52807 = ~Take your time. It's not like I've a military expedition to coordinate or anything.~
@52808 = ~You know me, monk? ~
@52809 = ~I'd say we can be reasonably sure there's something wrong with at least one of you, regardless of what the monk sees.~ [BD52809]
@52810 = ~There are few in this city who don't know the hero of Baldur's Gate. But what brings you back to this place?~ [BD52810]
@52811 = ~An impending journey to the north. I need people of skill and honor, people I can trust, by my side. I need you.~
@52812 = ~Come morning, I shall embark on a journey north to face Caelar Argent. I would have you beside me. ~
@52813 = ~Would that I could join you. I would see Caelar fall as much as any man who's heard the tales these people tell. But another, more subtle darkness is spreading as well. In the past few weeks, many servants of Selûne have gone missing.~ [BD52813]
@52814 = ~These are turbulent times. Perhaps your fellows are simply engaged in their own business, and neglected to inform thee of their plans. Art thou certain foul play has occurred?~ [BD52814]
@52815 = ~I cannot deny the possibility. But it is a risk I cannot afford to take.~ [BD52815]
@52816 = ~Even if I could leave the refugees to their fates, I cannot abandon my brothers and sisters, not now. I am truly sorry.~ [BD52816]
@52817 = ~Don't be, Rasaad. Your fellow Selûnites need you. The Fist will be with me. I'll manage. ~
@52818 = ~As am I. Fare thee well, Rasaad yn Bashir. I hope we meet again. ~
@52819 = ~Fine. Waste your time caring for sheep while a stronger <PRO_MANWOMAN> goes to face down the wolf. I don't need you.~
@52820 = ~Do they truly need to say it? It's unlikely they would be standing here now had the assassins finished the job.~ [BD52820]
@52821 = ~Art thou certain foul play has occurred? These are turbulent times. Perhaps thy colleagues are engaged in their own business and simply neglected to tell thee.~ [BD52821]
@52822 = ~I cannot deny the possibility. But it is a risk I cannot afford to take.~ [BD52822]
@52823 = ~I love what you've done with your hair. If only Minsc could make his do the same, but alas, it is not to be. Farewell. ~
@52824 = ~The monk has made his intentions clear. This pathetic attempt to elicit guilt for his decision is beneath thee.~ [BD52824]
@52825 = ~Boo says it is better to have a second hand than no hands at all. This is the wisdom of the space hamster.~ [BD52825]
@52826 = ~Perhaps thou should let the monk speak, Minsc. Rasaad, thou wert telling us of the Shining Lady...?~ [BD52826]
@52827 = ~Please. I admire optimism as much as the next girl, <CHARNAME>, but there is a limit.~ [BD52827]
@52828 = ~It is a good thing. As long as hope remains in our hearts, darkness cannot prevail. I pray you have good fortune on your journey. Now, if you will excuse me, I have matters I must attend to. Farewell.~ [BD52828]
@52829 = ~I can't imagine why. One look at her tells me all I care to know.~ [BD52829]
@52830 = ~It's always good to see a woman in a position of power. Tell us about yourself.~ [BD52830]
@52831 = ~Yes! And Minsc and Boo will join you.~ [BD52831]
@52832 = ~I do not think Boo would enjoy not sleeping in the fashion they anticipate.~ [BD52832]
@52833 = ~My mind is filled with images of butts... Evil butts, and the kicking we shall give them!~ [BD52833]
@52834 = ~And what we can stop her from doing.~ [BD52834]
@52835 = ~Our cause is just. What could be better than fighting for it, eh? Boo, can you tell me this? No, I thought not. ~
@52836 = ~Not everyone finds combat as thrilling as thee, Minsc. We have talked about this, remember? ~
@52837 = ~Not really? Are you sure we talked about it? I really don't think we did... Boo, do you remember? ~
@52838 = ~The assassins are dead. <CHARNAME> lives. I'd say our friend here was on as right a side as it's possible to be in such circumstances. ~
@52839 = ~You needn't worry about that. Our friend is completely oblivious. He doesn't notice the most obvious things, even those things right in front of his face.~ [BD52839]
@52840 = ~Well done, <CHARNAME>. Put the mercenary in her place. ~
@52841 = ~Maybe you could put me in my place, Safana.~
@52842 = ~Are you suggesting we, that you and I, we—what are you suggesting, exactly? ~
@52843 = ~You tell me. Give it some thought and let me know what you come up with. <CHARNAME>, I'll follow you out once you leave.~
@52844 = ~Now that I am looking at him, I'm not so sure that's true. This elf has the air of a scoundrel about him.~ [BD52844]
@52845 = ~Boo does not like scoundrels. I do not like scoundrels either.~ [BD52845]
@52846 = ~I'd like nothing better than to help you, <CHARNAME>—well actually, that's a lie. There are many things I'd rather do—I believe I'll go do some of them right now. No, no, don't start, my mind is made up. I'll not be swayed by tears. Hey—it's all right. I'm sure you'll do fine without me. ~
@52847 = ~It is rare for this one to have a bad day, I think.~ [BD52847]
@52848 = ~In broadest strokes, please. I, for one, have little interest in the details.~ [BD52848]
@52849 = ~Boo says the more details, the better. My hamster thirsts for knowledge.~ [BD52849]
@52850 = ~And of course your first thought was of Safana. You have impeccable taste, <CHARNAME>. And as it happens I'm not enjoying the city as much recently. A journey with the hero of the city might be just the thing to shake me from my doldrums. ~
@52851 = ~Consider me persuaded. I will join you. Let's be away from this miserable place before SOMEone returns to make it even more miserable...~ [BD52851]
@52852 = ~No. You aren't. ~
@52853 = ~I think she wishes us to leave. Does anyone else have that feeling?~ [BD52853]
@52854 = ~You'll feel a chair smashed against your skull if you don't leave this instant, you demented oaf. Go!~ [BD52854]
@52855 = ~Minsc is an old hand at being begone. Do as I do, everyone. Be quiet and walk slowly... away...~ [BD52855]
@52856 = ~It is hard to avoid sometimes.~ [BD52856]
@52857 = ~The more the merrier!~ [BD52857]
@52858 = ~Do not fear, <CHARNAME>. Her heart is not really breaking, Boo says. Her face is pretty, but her mouth is full of lies.~ [BD52858]
@52859 = ~We will see who punish murders who for murder punishment—right now!~ [BD52859]
@52860 = ~Do you think there might be a better strategy we could use here than goading a half-mad mage to anger?~ [BD52860]
@52861 = ~Thou wilt see the wicked one long before us, mage. ~
@52862 = ~How did she get free?~ [BD52862]
@52863 = ~I would have. My time with Boo has made me a keen observer of my surroundings.~ [BD52863]
@52864 = ~Show some compassion, <CHARNAME>. Just seconds ago, these guards fought for their life. Their blood runs hot in their veins. Only a fool would expect poetry under such circumstances.~ [BD52864]
@52865 = ~All the boys are leaving? That is a shame. Ah well, life goes on.~ [BD52865]
@52866 = ~Not yet, I'm afraid. I'll keep searching.~
@52867 = ~Another Fist was here a few moments ago. They didn't mention one of their own being in a cell.~
@52868 = ~I was told the only occupied cell down here held a doppelganger.~
@52869 = ~They didn't know I was here. You need to get me out of here, quickly—though I may be safer in here than you are out there.~
@52870 = ~You seem very anxious to leave the security of your cell...~
@52871 = ~Just let me out! Please! ~
@52872 = ~I see. Very well, then, let us speak honestly. I have much to offer you, if you give me my freedom.~
@52873 = ~And what does this word "veritable" mean?~ [BD52873]
@52874 = ~Do not cross me, doppelganger. I've better things to do than hunt an errant shapeshifter through the city. Make me do so and you will pay a heavy price.~
@52875 = ~I'll be there. See that you are too. ~
@52876 = ~Better than you have tried to escape my wrath—all lie dead. Understood?~
@52877 = ~Who art thou, and how wert thou ensnared?~ [BD52877]
@52878 = ~Let Minsc handle this, <CHARNAME>. I am good at this game. Tell me, mercenary: Is it animal, vegetable, or mineral?~ [BD52878]
@52879 = ~I—I don't know what you mean... ~
@52880 = ~Thanks doesn't pay the rent, as my grandmother used to say.~ [BD52880]
@52881 = ~I've heard THAT story before.~ [BD52881]
@52882 = ~Barrels line the walls, filled with enough water to sustain Caelar's crusade in Dragonspear Castle for months.~
@52883 = ~Barrels line the walls, filled with enough water to sustain Caelar's crusade in Dragonspear Castle for months. If you wished, you could poison them.~
@52884 = ~You pour a drop of poison into each water barrel. The water takes on a musty smell.~
@52885 = ~Sacks of wheat, potatoes, and onions are piled high. With this much food, the gods alone know how long Caelar's crusade could hold Dragonspear.~
@52886 = ~Sacks of wheat, potatoes, and onions are piled high. With this much food, the gods alone know how long the crusade might hold the castle. That could change if you use the poison Torsin de Lancie supplied you.~
@52887 = ~You apply the poison to the supplies. A foul smell curdles the air, but it dissipates quickly. Someone in Dragonspear will regret eating this food, and soon.~
@52888 = ~Refugee~
@52889 = ~I lost everything... everything.~
@52890 = ~The inn burned down a few days ago, and now we don't even have shelter on the road.~
@52891 = ~The crusade took me food an' left me in the dust. I head south and what do I find? More destruction.~
@52892 = ~I haven't been able to find my sister since the crusade came through. She'll be all right, won't she?~
@52893 = ~Fifty years that farm's been in my family. All gone now, thanks to that Shining Witch.~
@52894 = ~I wish the inn were still standing, but crusaders burned it down. Not a very noble act.~
@52895 = ~I prayed to Helm for protection, but the crusade still burned my home. Can it be true Caelar has the gods' favor?~
@52896 = ~I was thinking of moving anyway.~
@52897 = ~Caelar's mercenaries could have at least left the inn standing so we'd have somewhere to sleep.~
@52898 = ~I'm nearly out of food. Got some hungry days ahead, I think.~
@52899 = ~What's the crusade hoping to accomplish? They've seized the bridge, and now we can't even head north.~
@52900 = ~I've seen you before. I was in Baldur's Gate not long ago—you're the one who killed Sarevok. You can help us!~
@52901 = ~You've better things to do than talk to me, I'm sure.~
@52902 = ~Well met, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@52903 = ~The crusade is massed by the bridge. No one's getting over the Winding Water now.~
@52904 = ~That makes two of us.~ [BD52904]
@52905 = ~Naught but the false promises of a lying devil. We shall not be deceived.~ [BD52905]
@52906 = ~Mercy? I'll show more than you would have. Did you like your cell? You'll be enjoying its comforts for a long time to come.~
@52907 = ~The doppelthinger calls us crazy, Boo. This insult cannot stand!~ [BD52907]
@52908 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>. You don't actually believe this doppelganger, do you?~ [BD52908]
@52909 = ~The treasure is very real, I assure you.~
@52910 = ~Thou are wise to ignore this creature's words, <CHARNAME>. It would say anything to trick thee into freeing it.~ [BD52910]
@52911 = ~Heed this Rashemen cow's words and you'll be throwing away a fortune. The choice is yours.~
@52912 = ~I'll be happy to do so, once you release me.~
@52913 = ~I am not sure this is such a good idea, <CHARNAME>...~ [BD52913]
@52914 = ~A valid philosophy, IF one can afford to lose what one ventures. 'Tis a bit late to consider that now, though. In future, you might consider consulting me sooner, that you might properly benefit from my wisdom.~ [BD52914]
@52915 = ~It must. Why else would it be here?~ [BD52915]
@52916 = ~Shame on you, <CHARNAME>. How could you doubt the intentions of a murderous shapeshifting monster?~ [BD52916]
@52917 = ~You understand, doppelthingy? No path crossing for you!~ [BD52917]
@52918 = ~You'll want to visit Sorcerous Sundries, then. I can get you there.~
@52919 = ~We can discuss that later. Right now, I need supplies.~
@52920 = ~Uh-oh.~
@52921 = ~All right, all right, I get the message!~
@52922 = ~So, <CHARNAME>... Long time no see. Well, I guess it hasn't been that long—like a few seconds, really—but, uh... how are you?~ [BD52922]
@52923 = ~I'm doing... well. All things considered.~
@52924 = ~Beyond having a madwoman and her army of zealots out to kill me? I'm fine. How are you?~
@52925 = ~Why do you ask?~
@52926 = ~I'd be better if I didn't get involved in a prolonged discussion about how I am.~
@52927 = ~Yeah, all right, you don't want to talk. I get it. Just know this, then. Whatever you have to face, you don't have to face it alone. If you need to talk—I'm here.~ [BD52927]
@52928 = ~You just seem—different.~ [BD52928]
@52929 = ~If I am, it's only in response to an unpleasant situation. I'm still the same <PRO_MANWOMAN> I've always been.~
@52930 = ~Having a crazed paladin target you for death does tend to change one's outlook.~
@52931 = ~Circumstances change. I do not. Whatever you see in me now is a product of your own overactive imagination.~
@52932 = ~Caelar's who you should be focused upon. Or possibly Adoy. What I am, if I have indeed changed—it matters not.~
@52933 = ~I don't think so. There's something about you, a—I don't want to say darkness, but I just did, so I guess it's too late now.~ [BD52933]
@52934 = ~I'm a child of Bhaal. Darkness is in my blood.~
@52935 = ~If you've a problem with me, Neera, you're free to go.~
@52936 = ~Dark times inspire dark thoughts.~
@52937 = ~If I seem darker now than when last we met, it's only because you're now seeing me with open eyes.~
@52938 = ~Just don't drown in those thoughts, all right?~ [BD52938]
@52939 = ~You really don't get it, do you? Friends HELP friends with their problems.~ [BD52939]
@52940 = ~I'm not sure I like the new you. Or the old you. Whatever you is talking to me now. I'm—I'm gonna stop talking to both of you for the moment.~ [BD52940]
@52941 = ~You don't really care to know the answer, do you?~ [BD52941]
@52942 = ~Forgive me, Neera. I didn't mean to be harsh. It's just been a trying time.~
@52943 = ~No, please, tell me. Every fiber of my being is consumed by a desire to talk about your feelings.~
@52944 = ~Not particularly.~
@52945 = ~How we feel... It's irrelevant. It doesn't matter. All that matters is what we do.~
@52946 = ~I'm tempted to tell you all about them in excruciating detail just because I know it'd bother you.~ [BD52946]
@52947 = ~You've changed, <CHARNAME>. You're—darker now. Or maybe you've always been that way and I'm only just seeing it.~ [BD52947]
@52948 = ~For a lot of people. But you seem to get the sharp edge of the sword more often than most.~ [BD52948]
@52949 = ~That's just part and parcel of being a child of Bhaal.~
@52950 = ~If I didn't have bad luck, I'd have no luck at all.~
@52951 = ~I give worse than I get.~
@52952 = ~You aren't your father, <CHARNAME>. You're nothing like him. Look at all the good you've done.~ [BD52952]
@52953 = ~I try to. I do. But it's hard to see it sometimes.~
@52954 = ~You always did know how to cheer me up.~
@52955 = ~Look at all the blood I've spilled doing it.~
@52956 = ~You tread on dangerous ground, Neera. You may not like where you find yourself.~
@52957 = ~You did what you had to do. You always have. You carry whatever weight the world puts on you, always. I wish I could say the same.~ [BD52957]
@52958 = ~Speaking of weight, this conversation's a little too heavy for me. But—if you do need to talk—I'm here. All right?~ [BD52958]
@52959 = ~Thanks, Neera.~
@52960 = ~I'll keep it in mind.~
@52961 = ~Any time.~ [BD52961]
@52962 = ~Or perhaps, "Thank you, Neera," and then "You're welcome, <CHARNAME>."~ [BD52962]
@52963 = ~Just joking. Mostly. If you need me, you know where to find me.~ [BD52963]
@52964 = ~All things? That's a lot of things to consider. Could we just consider MOST things? Or the good things?~ [BD52964]
@52965 = ~I guess it would. Luckily, I only do have to guess. I don't know how I'd feel walking a mile in your boots. I'd probably spend it running the exact opposite direction you are.~ [BD52965]
@52966 = ~I do seem to attract trouble. My father's gift to his beloved <PRO_SONDAUGHTER>.~
@52967 = ~Yes, well, you're a sensible person. Unfortunately, I'm me.~
@52968 = ~Whatever you have to face, you don't have to face it alone. If you need to talk—I'm here. All right?~ [BD52968]
@52969 = ~Thanks, Neera.~
@52970 = ~I'll keep it in mind.~
@52971 = ~I think you may be the first person who has ever accused me of being sensible...~ [BD52971]
@52972 = ~Yeah, but you always manage to deal with it. No matter what the world throws at you, you keep going. I don't know how you do it. But there's something you should know...~
@52973 = ~That's what I'm here for! But seriously, <CHARNAME>...~ [BD52973]
@52974 = ~Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up... *sigh*... shut up.~ [BD52974]
@52975 = ~I'm starting to worry about you, Neera. We've got to get that wild mage out of your head.~
@52976 = ~Adoy's still giving you trouble, I take it?~
@52977 = ~I'm going to not talk to you now, which from the sounds of it should suit both of us.~
@52978 = ~I swear he's driving me insane, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD52978]
@52979 = ~You're strong, Neera. You can handle this. We'll get the ingredients for your potion together soon, and then you'll be free of Adoy.~
@52980 = ~At least it's a short trip.~
@52981 = ~How can you tell?~
@52982 = ~KEEP TALKIN'! I'LL FIND YOU, AND WHEN I DO, YOU ARE GOING TO REGRET THE DAY YOU WERE BORN!~ [BD52982]
@52983 = ~Try to remember Adoy's as much a victim in this as you are. I'm sure he's no more thrilled being stuck in your head than you are having him stuck there.~
@52984 = ~Yeah, I did sort of go over the line there, didn't I?~
@52985 = ~I hope that was aimed at Adoy.~
@52986 = ~Screaming threats at the voice in your head. Of course. That will surely get the desired result.~
@52987 = ~It was. I already know where to find you. But make another "short trip" crack and Adoy will get a preview of what's coming to him...~ [BD52987]
@52988 = ~Gee, you think?~ [BD52988]
@52989 = ~Sorry. You know it's not you...~ [BD52989]
@52990 = ~I'd hope my voice in your head wouldn't affect you so.~
@52991 = ~I know. It's not easy for any of us right now, is it?~
@52992 = ~Even so, we're done talking now.~
@52993 = ~No, when I hear your voice, it makes me feel better.~ [BD52993]
@52994 = ~I'm glad to hear it. I feel the same way.~
@52995 = ~Please tell me you don't hear my voice in your head like you do Adoy's.~
@52996 = ~And so it should.~
@52997 = ~And then your wonderful voice says something like that and my murderous impulses return.~ [BD52997]
@52998 = ~Sorry. I shouldn't be making jokes about your situation.~
@52999 = ~Shutting up now.~
@53000 = ~Make good use of them. Focus on Caelar and her destruction.~
@53001 = ~I don't want that, necessarily. I just want you to tell me—tell me things are gonna be all right.~ [BD53001]
@53002 = ~They're going to be better than all right, Neera. For you, at least.~
@53003 = ~Things are going to be all right...?~
@53004 = ~You would have me lie to you.~
@53005 = ~I like the sound of that. I really hope you're right.~ [BD53005]
@53006 = ~I WOULD have, but you made mincemeat of that idea. Do you ever think before you open your mouth?~ [BD53006]
@53007 = ~No, don't answer that. I've had enough of your voice right now.~ [BD53007]
@53008 = ~And I've had enough of YOUR voice to last me a lifetime, Adoy. SEVERAL lifetimes. Long ones too, ones with great-grandkids. That's how much I've had it with your voice.~ [BD53008]
@53009 = ~Damn, <CHARNAME>, you could at least try a LITTLE. Way to kill the moment.~ [BD53009]
@53010 = ~Don't say any more. I've had enough of your voice for the moment.~ [BD53010]
@53011 = ~It's all right. When this is all over, I'm sure I'll look back on this all and laugh. Eventually.~ [BD53011]
@53012 = ~Kinda hard to focus at all right now. I've got to find the rest of this potion's ingredients. And soon.~ [BD53012]
@53013 = ~Really? My voice makes you feel good?~ [BD53013]
@53014 = ~It does. Things are—not great right now, obviously. But having you here makes it tolerable.~
@53015 = ~No. Mine does.~
@53016 = ~Yes. Because I know it will stop nattering, eventually, and I will finally have some peace.~
@53017 = ~Making things tolerable is what I do. Now if I could just get rid of Adoy, my life might get tolerable again...~ [BD53017]
@53018 = ~Ah, who am I kidding? My life's always been a mess. But it was a quiet mess; the only voices in my head were the ones that would SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP when I told them to.~ [BD53018]
@53019 = ~I miss those voices. Especially the part where they STOPPED TALKING.~ [BD53019]
@53020 = ~TAKE THE HINT, ADOY. Yeesh...~ [BD53020]
@53021 = ~I remember when the voices in my head SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT! UUUUUUUP! when I told them to.~ [BD53021]
@53022 = ~I know, I know. It's just—it feels like he never stops talking!~ [BD53022]
@53023 = ~And YOU can shut up too.~ [BD53023]
@53024 = ~Oh, don't be that way, <CHARNAME>. I'm just—it's not easy for me, you know?~ [BD53024]
@53025 = ~It really isn't.~ [BD53025]
@53026 = ~Yes, that should work—worth a try, anyway...~ [BD53026]
@53027 = ~Hey, I need help.~ [BD53027]
@53028 = ~Is everything all right?~
@53029 = ~Really? I hadn't noticed... Joking! Don't give me that look.~
@53030 = ~Obviously. Good luck finding some.~
@53031 = ~Fine. I'm just— I AM TRYING TO HAVE A MOMENT. SHUT UP.~ [BD53031]
@53032 = ~What look? I don't know what you're—I SWEAR TO GODS, I AM TRYING TO HAVE A MOMENT, SHUT UP—talking about!~ [BD53032]
@53033 = ~Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait. Don't leave me. Please?~ [BD53033]
@53034 = ~Look. I'll be honest.~ [BD53034]
@53035 = ~I need a distraction. Something. Anything. Desperately.~ [BD53035]
@53036 = ~How desperately are we talking?~
@53037 = ~Ever try sport?~
@53038 = ~Have you tried talking to Minsc?~
@53039 = ~Unlike you, I can't afford distractions right now.~
@53040 = ~Good luck finding something. Now if you'll excuse me, I've actual important matters to attend to.~
@53041 = ~Minsc! Yes! The perfect distraction. Great idea, <CHARNAME>. Thanks.~ [BD53041]
@53042 = ~Uh, pretty desperately. On a scale of one to ten, around an eight. Hundred. Maybe eight hundred and fifty.~ [BD53042]
@53043 = ~I used to play ball ball.~ [BD53043]
@53044 = ~"Ball ball"? What kind of sport is that?~
@53045 = ~Go play some ball ball then, and stop bothering me.~
@53046 = ~I'm leaving now. ~
@53047 = ~No, don't go. Please. Please, please, please, please, please, pleeeeeeease.~ [BD53047]
@53048 = ~Just talk to me. That's all I ask. Just give me something to listen to other than—GODS, ADOY, SHUT THE HELLS UP OR I WILL KILL YOU IN A STRICTLY METAPHORICAL SENSE—*him*.~ [BD53048]
@53049 = ~What do you want to talk about?~
@53050 = ~I AM talking to you.~
@53051 = ~I don't need to point out how you sound when you speak to Adoy anymore at this point, do I?~
@53052 = ~You start with two balls, everyone stands in a circle, then you throw the first—~ [BD53052]
@53053 = ~Actually, never mind. Ball ball was terrible. I always lost ball ball, but I can't lose some things, CAN I, ADOY?~ [BD53053]
@53054 = ~You need a group to play ball ball, and a couple of balls—FOR THE LOVE OF GODS EVERYWHERE, LEAVE ME ALONE—and I always hated ball ball anyway.~ [BD53054]
@53055 = ~Fine! Fine. Leave me to suffer, then. I bet you'll be super happy when my brain starts leaking out of my ears BECAUSE SOMEONE WON'T SHUT UP!~ [BD53055]
@53056 = ~Oh, you're actually willing to do it? I didn't think you would. Hadn't thought that far ahead.~ [BD53056]
@53057 = ~Right. Well.~ [BD53057]
@53058 = ~I am teetering, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD53058]
@53059 = ~Caelar's crusade, hey? What's with that?~ [BD53059]
@53060 = ~Would that I knew. Her goals seem to be noble, but some of her actions continue to confound me.~
@53061 = ~Her conviction is impressive. Which is as nice a way to say she's utterly mad as I can think of.~
@53062 = ~I'm done wasting words on Caelar.~
@53063 = ~We don't need to understand her to—I'M IGNORING YOU—defeat her, though.~ [BD53063]
@53064 = ~That's what I like about you, <CHARNAME>. You always have a kind word, even for your enemies. Her conviction is really something. Yep. She's got a whole lot of conviction...~ [BD53064]
@53065 = ~Okayyyy... That didn't work.~ [BD53065]
@53066 = ~Okay. This isn't working.~ [BD53066]
@53067 = ~But I have an idea. Just work with me here...~
@53068 = ~What... are you doing?~
@53069 = ~Neera—I care for you. I do. But I don't want this to happen. Not like this. We'll get rid of Adoy, I promise you. You just need to hang on until then. Can you do that?~
@53070 = ~I think I might like this idea.~
@53071 = ~I don't think so. You're useful to me, so I indulge your eccentricities. But I'm not interested in you like that.~
@53072 = ~A girl throws herself at you, and this is how you respond? Gah! Why do you have to be so, so, so NOBLE?~ [BD53072]
@53073 = ~Shhh. Shhhhhhh.~ [BD53073]
@53074 = ~Gods damn it. All right. Fine. Whatever. I'll talk to you later.~ [BD53074]
@53075 = ~Mmm...~ [BD53075]
@53076 = ~Your lips taste of mead. How much have you had to drink?~
@53077 = ~Well, I'm certainly distracted. Did it work for you?~
@53078 = ~Now that's what I call a distraction...~
@53079 = ~Not enough. Nothing makes him go away. NOTHING.~ [BD53079]
@53080 = ~Oh. Oh, gods, no. He ENJOYED that. HE enjoyed it. Ugh. NOT OKAY, ADOY.~ [BD53080]
@53081 = ~Thanks for trying. Maybe when this is all over... you and I seem to work well together.~ [BD53081]
@53082 = ~We do, don't we?~
@53083 = ~You just need to hold on until we can get rid of Adoy. I know you can do it. You're one of the strongest people I've ever met. We are going to fix this, Neera. ~
@53084 = ~Are we done now? We've work to do.~
@53085 = ~We do. Just not when I've got a third wheel turning around and around and around in my brain. Someday, maybe, we can be really alone. Alone. That would be—that would be great.~ [BD53085]
@53086 = ~I hope you're right. I hope you're right SOON.~ [BD53086]
@53087 = ~Yes! Work. Let's do it!~ [BD53087]
@53088 = ~You know something, <CHARNAME>?~ [BD53088]
@53089 = ~Some things. Never enough of them, though.~
@53090 = ~I know many things. I am a wise, wise man. ~
@53091 = ~Can it wait? We're kind of in a hurry here.~
@53092 = ~I know more than enough, and I've no inclination to add to that knowledge right now. If we have to chat, we can do it when Caelar's in the ground.~
@53093 = ~I like you. It's stuff like what you just said that makes me really glad that you're around.~ [BD53093]
@53094 = ~I want to say something serious, so I'm gonna let that one pass. I'm really glad you're around.~ [BD53094]
@53095 = ~It'll only take a second.~ [BD53095]
@53096 = ~I know I haven't been easy to get along with recently. Or, you know. Remain sane in the proximity of.~ [BD53096]
@53097 = ~It wasn't your fault, Neera. Adoy was driving you to distraction, and—~
@53098 = ~No problem. I'm more or less immune to insanity at this point.~
@53099 = ~I briefly considered running for the hills when we met, but now I'm glad I didn't.~
@53100 = ~Totally. You have no idea what it's like having someone interrupt you CONSTANTLY. The man never shuts up.~ [BD53100]
@53101 = ~Still, it couldn't have been fun. It certainly wasn't for me.~ [BD53101]
@53102 = ~I wouldn't have blamed you if you did abandon me.~ [BD53102]
@53103 = ~You stuck with me, though. So, thanks. You're the best.~ [BD53103]
@53104 = ~It's the least I can do for my favorite wild mage.~
@53105 = ~You know I'd do anything for you, Neera.~
@53106 = ~Perhaps not the best. Among the best, certainly. Top Five at least, I should think.~
@53107 = ~Did you have something you wanted to discuss other than the obvious?~
@53108 = ~I don't know how many wild mages you know, so that might not be much of a compliment. Still, I'm glad to hear it.~ [BD53108]
@53109 = ~I know.~ [BD53109]
@53110 = ~And so modest to boot!~ [BD53110]
@53111 = ~You know, I was about to say something nice about you, but in retrospect, I'm glad I didn't.~ [BD53111]
@53112 = ~No. I kinda regret talking as much as I did now.~ [BD53112]
@53113 = ~Go in, kill the enemy, get out, celebrate. Everything in life should be this straightforward.~ [BD53113]
@53114 = ~It can't be?~
@53115 = ~Sounds like you've got something on your mind.~
@53116 = ~Simple pleasures are the best. And best enjoyed in silence. You understand?~
@53117 = ~Not in my world. Not at the moment, anyway.~ [BD53117]
@53118 = ~Yeah. Mostly the guy I recently got out of it.~ [BD53118]
@53119 = ~I'm just— What happened with Adoy is eating at me. How do you know when you've made the right decision, y'know?~ [BD53119]
@53120 = ~You can never know. Just do the best you can, and hope it's enough.~
@53121 = ~You know it's the right decision because it's the decision you made.~
@53122 = ~What's done is done. You can't let it bother you now.~
@53123 = ~Yeah. I understand. Forget I said anything.~ [BD53123]
@53124 = ~Yeah. Hope.~ [BD53124]
@53125 = ~Is that how you do it? I wish I had your confidence.~ [BD53125]
@53126 = ~When I cut Adoy off, it felt like the right decision at the time. I still think it was. I hated feeling so—helpless.~ [BD53126]
@53127 = ~I couldn't DO anything for him. Wherever he was, he was trapped. The only thing he could do was drive me halfway to madness.~ [BD53127]
@53128 = ~Exactly. He almost drove you insane. You did what you had to do.~
@53129 = ~You're lucky he didn't drive you further.~
@53130 = ~Better you than me.~
@53131 = ~I know. I know he didn't. I just wish I could have done something... more.~ [BD53131]
@53132 = ~I heard his every thought, but I couldn't do anything for him.~ [BD53132]
@53133 = ~Gee. Thanks.~ [BD53133]
@53134 = ~I'm tired of feeling helpless. I'm done with it. Next time, I WILL help. I will find a way.~ [BD53134]
@53135 = ~We're never gonna be safe again, are we?~ [BD53135]
@53136 = ~It's not looking likely, no.~
@53137 = ~Why would you want safe? Safe is boring. ~
@53138 = ~What brought this on?~
@53139 = ~Whining about it certainly won't make us any safer.~
@53140 = ~I always thought that one day—one shining, beautiful day—I could go fifteen minutes without having to worry about being killed.~ [BD53140]
@53141 = ~Safe might be boring, but on the upside, it is safe.~ [BD53141]
@53142 = ~Our impending doom, mostly.~ [BD53142]
@53143 = ~All right, I get it. Let's do this.~ [BD53143]
@53144 = ~It's stupid, I know.~ [BD53144]
@53145 = ~Wanting to be safe isn't stupid. It's healthy.~
@53146 = ~You are a wild mage. Danger is part of the package.~
@53147 = ~It makes no difference where you are. There's always danger. Always. Never think otherwise.~
@53148 = ~Yeah, but me being who I am, the world being as it is... There's always gonna be something dangerous and scary and murder-y around.~ [BD53148]
@53149 = ~True. I am what I am, and being in mortal peril's part of that.~ [BD53149]
@53150 = ~I was fooling myself. But not any longer.~ [BD53150]
@53151 = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>. Let's do this.~ [BD53151]
@53152 = ~And it's not gonna stop me, not anymore. Not ever again. Let's do this.~ [BD53152]
@53153 = ~I never thought I'd be so happy to see a normal, non-lava-spewing basement.~ [BD53153]
@53154 = ~Not that I had any doubts we'd see a normal, non-lava-spewing basement again, mind you. We are GOOD. Almost too good.~ [BD53154]
@53155 = ~You were very good.~
@53156 = ~I'm okay. You—you were fantastic, Neera. I couldn't have done this without you. Beauty, brains, and—something else that starts with B. Bewitching. You've got it all.~
@53157 = ~ 'Twas a passable effort.~
@53158 = ~Good isn't good enough. I shall be great, or nothing.~
@53159 = ~We just killed a devil and walked out of one of the Nine Hells. That's pretty great if you ask me. But nobody did, so shutting up now.~ [BD53159]
@53160 = ~Oh, I'm just gettin' started.~ [BD53160]
@53161 = ~You silver-tongued dev—actually, I think I saw a silver-tongued devil a couple hours ago. It didn't look nearly as good as you.~
@53162 = ~Passable, huh? How about I make you passably pink?~ [BD53162]
@53163 = ~...Actually, never mind. I don't think the crowd would appreciate you being pink as much as I would.~ [BD53163]
@53164 = ~I certainly wouldn't.~
@53165 = ~You're a smart woman, Neera.~
@53166 = ~I don't know. Pink looks pretty fetching on me.~
@53167 = ~Would it kill you to be serious for once in your life?~
@53168 = ~Well, excuuuuuse me. We just killed a devil and walked out of one of the Nine Hells. I don't know about you, but I'M gonna celebrate.~ [BD53168]
@53169 = ~I'll save that one for another time.~ [BD53169]
@53170 = ~You're just figuring that out now? Shame on you, <CHARNAME>. Shaaaame. You're lucky I'm in a forgiving mood.~ [BD53170]
@53171 = ~I bet it does. I think you'd look VERY fetching in pink undergarments. And even better without them.~ [BD53171]
@53172 = ~Come here, you.~ [BD53172]
@53173 = ~Whatever you say, O mighty one.~
@53174 = ~If you insist.~
@53175 = ~Neera... There are people here...~
@53176 = ~I can't, Neera. I don't feel that way about you.~
@53177 = ~...Oh. I thought... Well, I guess it doesn't matter what I thought.~ [BD53177]
@53178 = ~I'm sorry, Neera. I didn't mean to lead you on.~
@53179 = ~Not really. In the greater scheme of things, it matters little what anyone thinks.~
@53180 = ~No, no. You have nothing to apologize for. I'm the one who— Uh, sorry, I misunderstood things, I guess.~ [BD53180]
@53181 = ~I see. I guess I'll just— Excuse me.~ [BD53181]
@53182 = ~Friends?~ [BD53182]
@53183 = ~Always.~
@53184 = ~Well, yeah, I hope so.~
@53185 = ~Allies.~
@53186 = ~That's good enough for me.~ [BD53186]
@53187 = ~Well, I won't say that I'm not disappointed, but if that's what you want—if that's ALL you want—then it'll have to do.~ [BD53187]
@53188 = ~If that's the way you want it, I guess I'll have to live with it. Have a good night, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD53188]
@53189 = ~Mmm...~ [BD53189]
@53190 = ~So?~ [BD53190]
@53191 = ~I like you, <CHARNAME>. I think I like you a lot.~ [BD53191]
@53192 = ~I like you, Neera. A little more than a lot.~
@53193 = ~Is that what you think?~
@53194 = ~And who can blame you?~
@53195 = ~I see. That's... nice.~
@53196 = ~Good.~ [BD53196]
@53197 = ~You bet your pretty little butt.~ [BD53197]
@53198 = ~I'm glad you think so.~ [BD53198]
@53199 = ~When this is over—when everything here is done—maybe the two of us could go somewhere, you know... a little quieter. More private.~ [BD53199]
@53200 = ~I'd like that. I would like that a lot.~
@53201 = ~Uhh... Yes, please?~
@53202 = ~We'll discuss it later. For now, let's focus on celebrating our victory.~
@53203 = ~Excellent. Now where did that mead cart go...?~ [BD53203]
@53204 = ~Gods, <CHARNAME>! Could you be more adorable?~ [BD53204]
@53205 = ~Woohoo! Celebration! I want some mutton. WHO'S GOT MUTTON?~ [BD53205]
@53206 = ~Wow. Chains aren't a good look for you.~ [BD53206]
@53207 = ~Neera! You have to help me get out of here.~
@53208 = ~The jesters' guild suffered a great loss when you decided to pursue magic.~
@53209 = ~I'm glad to see you too.~
@53210 = ~You killed someone, <CHARNAME>. Not just killed—you murdered her. How could you do that? Explain it to me, please. I need to understand.~ [BD53210]
@53211 = ~No—you can't believe I did that. You can't.~
@53212 = ~Someone murdered her. Not me. I don't know who, or how they did it. And I won't find out while I'm locked in this cell.~
@53213 = ~You actually believe that? Go, then. I've no use for you.~
@53214 = ~You didn't do it?~ [BD53214]
@53215 = ~Of course I didn't do it! I don't know who did—I don't know how. And I won't find out while I'm stuck in here.~
@53216 = ~Try to think, just once in your godsforsaken life. Where's the benefit in killing Skie Silvershield? What would killing the daughter of a Grand Duke gain me, other than a death sentence?~
@53217 = ~You doubt me? Then go. Get out of here—now!~
@53218 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. Goodbye.~ [BD53218]
@53219 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I believe you—I do—but...~ [BD53219]
@53220 = ~They made me swear an oath I wouldn't help you. Even if I hadn't—you have no idea how many people, how much magic they're putting into making sure you don't escape.~ [BD53220]
@53221 = ~I understand. At least someone believes me. That matters. Go, get out of here. I need to be alone now.~
@53222 = ~I thought we had something, Neera.~
@53223 = ~I'm a child of Bhaal. They'll take no chances with me, not after what happened with Sarevok.~
@53224 = ~Yeah... That makes sense.~ [BD53224]
@53225 = ~We did. We do. But some mountains are too high to climb, no matter how much you wish it otherwise.~ [BD53225]
@53226 = ~I hope you'll forgive my disappointment that you aren't even willing to try and climb this one.~
@53227 = ~So what will you do now?~
@53228 = ~If you won't climb this one with me, I'll do it alone. Get out, Neera. I never thought I'd say this, but I don't want to see you right now.~
@53229 = ~I get it.~ [BD53229]
@53230 = ~I always thought I'd missed my calling.~ [BD53230]
@53231 = ~I don't belong here, Neera. I didn't kill Skie. You know that, right? You must.~
@53232 = ~Now if you're quite done joking around, get the key for this cell. I need to get out of here.~
@53233 = ~I can't do that.~ [BD53233]
@53234 = ~And I'm glad you're okay—at least for the moment.~ [BD53234]
@53235 = ~Whew. Since you've been, uh, incarcerated, I... came across a wild mage. A dead one. He'd been dissected.~ [BD53235]
@53236 = ~Gods. Are you all right?~
@53237 = ~Dissected? What do you mean?~
@53238 = ~Who did this thing?~
@53239 = ~You're locked up, and I'm finding dead wild mages. No, I'm not all right! The man I found...~ [BD53239]
@53240 = ~His internal organs were gone. Pieces of him had been cut off. His skin was barely visible under all the runes branded on it.~ [BD53240]
@53241 = ~Do you remember what Adoy said? After we brought him here from the Fugue Plane?~ [BD53241]
@53242 = ~Beware the Red Wizards. ~
@53243 = ~It was Red Wizards—I'm sure of it. Pretty sure.~ [BD53243]
@53244 = ~I knew I'd seen some of those rune symbols they had branded on his body before, so I did some research. They were Thayan.~ [BD53244]
@53245 = ~I've got to find out what's going on. I'm leaving today.~ [BD53245]
@53246 = ~Leaving me to my fate.~
@53247 = ~I understand. Do what you must.~
@53248 = ~Thank you.~ [BD53248]
@53249 = ~Please don't make this harder than it already is. You know I can't do anything for you. I've had a hundred eyes on me since the second I left Dragonspear. If I tried anything, we'd both be dead before I finished it.~ [BD53249]
@53250 = ~I wish I could do something for you, but I can't. But I might be able to help other wild mages—if I act quickly enough.~ [BD53250]
@53251 = ~Goodbye, <CHARNAME>. And for what it's worth... good luck.~ [BD53251]
@53252 = ~You too. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD53252]
@53253 = ~If I could do anything, I would. I'm sorry. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD53253]
@53254 = ~That... that is not a good thing. It's a bad thing. A very bad thing.~ [BD53254]
@53255 = ~FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THE GODS, ADOY, I DON'T CARE ABOUT—er. Sorry. You were saying?~ [BD53255]
@53256 = ~Ooh, that's pretty.~ [BD53256]
@53257 = ~Sheesh! You burn down one stable, a temple, an armory, two barracks halls, and a temporary stable and nobody lets you forget it...~ [BD53257]
@53258 = ~Okay, what's with the alliteration? Is that a speech impediment, or do you actually talk like that on purpose?~ [BD53258]
@53259 = ~Just keep your paws off of me, big man. ~
@53260 = ~What's it like down there? Do you miss it?~ [BD53260]
@53261 = ~Can I pet him?~ [BD53261]
@53262 = ~You really think highly of yourself, don't you?~ [BD53262]
@53263 = ~Uh-huhhh... And Frixis said *I* liked to gather wool. He had no idea...~ [BD53263]
@53264 = ~Red Wizards. Ugh. UGH. UUUUUUUUGH.~ [BD53264]
@53265 = ~It's nice to hang around someone even less popular than me for a change.~ [BD53265]
@53266 = ~Stuff it, shorty!~ [BD53266]
@53267 = ~Who died and made you into... whatever you are?~ [BD53267]
@53268 = ~You're a good man. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.~ [BD53268]
@53269 = ~That—that right there—is that something you do by accident, or do you actually WANT people to hate and fear you?~ [BD53269]
@53270 = ~You think so? Let me ask you a question: How's the weather down there?~ [BD53270]
@53271 = ~That's right, I went there. Now I'd really like to go someplace else.~ [BD53271]
@53272 = ~Hey, he started it.~ [BD53272]
@53273 = ~Hey, she started it.~ [BD53273]
@53274 = ~Can we talk a second, <CHARNAME>? In private?~ [BD53274]
@53275 = ~Of course, Neera. What can I do for you?~
@53276 = ~This isn't the time, Neera.~
@53277 = ~All right. But we've gotta talk about this soon.~ [BD53277]
@53278 = ~You're right, it's way past time. We need to talk about the Red Wizard. NOW.~ [BD53278]
@53279 = ~This feral child has a problem with me? That is rich.~
@53280 = ~I can't be around Eddy Oddbody anymore. I don't like him, I don't trust him, and that cologne of his makes my eyes water.~ [BD53280]
@53281 = ~I see.~
@53282 = ~He does smell awful. But he has his uses.~
@53283 = ~Honestly? I don't fully trust him either. I'm kind of counting on you to watch my back here.~
@53284 = ~Are you giving me an ultimatum, Neera?~
@53285 = ~He probably thinks the same of you. What do you think'll happen when he stops thinking it?~ [BD53285]
@53286 = ~Edwin? Can you give our friend some comfort?~
@53287 = ~Hmm. A good point.~
@53288 = ~I think that's when I'll be glad to have you watching my back.~
@53289 = ~We'll cross that bridge when we come to it, and likely burn it behind us. Until then, Edwin remains with me.~
@53290 = ~Nothing good. Sorry, Edwin. This is where we part ways.~
@53291 = ~Oh, please. Tell me you don't think this—this pointy-eared marmoset's ramblings are worthy of your consideration, <CHARNAME>. ~
@53292 = ~Consideration, perhaps. But my decisions are my own.~
@53293 = ~It sounds like it's her or you, Edwin. And her I can actually trust.~
@53294 = ~I've given it the consideration it deserves. This is where we part ways, Neera.~
@53295 = ~You choose this wild simpleton over a Red Wizard of Thay?~
@53296 = ~A grave mistake, <CHARNAME>. One you WILL regret. (Oh yes, <PRO_HESHE> will.)~
@53297 = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>. I'll sleep a lot easier without him around.~ [BD53297]
@53298 = ~It's about the Red Wizard. I don't know how else to say this: He's got to go.~ [BD53298]
@53299 = ~No wild mage expects to die of old age. But I don't want to die with a knife in my back.~ [BD53299]
@53300 = ~So it's you or him, then? Very well. I choose him.~
@53301 = ~Nor do I. That's why I need you.~
@53302 = ~Sorry, Edwin. It's you or Neera, and her I can actually trust.~
@53303 = ~You have chosen wisely, <CHARNAME>. (Feh, they are truly a gorilla among chimpanzees, aren't they? Yes, they are...)~
@53304 = ~Well then. I guess this is goodbye. Farewell, <CHARNAME>. And watch your back. I don't think you really understand who's standing behind it.~ [BD53304]
@53305 = ~Oh. Oh, that was slick. Really slick. There aren't enough O's in smoooooth for you.~ [BD53305]
@53306 = ~All right, <CHARNAME>. You're clutching a bearded viper to your breast, but as long as you know you're doing it, I guess I can deal with it too.~ [BD53306]
@53307 = ~I must say, it is good to be traveling at your side once more.~
@53308 = ~I'm glad to have a talented warrior like you along on this mission.~
@53309 = ~It's good to have you around too. I just point you at the enemy and let you go.~
@53310 = ~Is there something you need? I don't have time for idle conversation.~
@53311 = ~I thought I had found my place in Baldur's Gate. When I saw you walk through the door, though, part of me knew my path would take me away from the city once more.~ [BD53311]
@53312 = ~You certainly didn't act like it.~
@53313 = ~And you're happy about that?~
@53314 = ~You should have joined me immediately instead of wasting my time.~
@53315 = ~I know. I... I had grown comfortable with my life, I suppose. My childhood, as you know, was one of chaos. In my work, I found routine and solace.~ [BD53315]
@53316 = ~If I have disturbed that solace, I'm truly sorry. You know as well as I do that traveling with me is a chaotic thing.~
@53317 = ~It's not like you to walk the easy route. Has something happened?~
@53318 = ~Routine is another word for boring. My way is much more exciting.~
@53319 = ~Nothing, save that I have been thinking about Gamaz more often. The sight of so many in need must have brought to the surface memories of my childhood. ~
@53320 = ~The wounds that throb are old ones. The memories will fade once more.~ [BD53320]
@53321 = ~If you stay with me, you might form much more exciting memories.~
@53322 = ~We'll face much peril in the future, but if I can help soothe your thoughts, please tell me so.~
@53323 = ~Perhaps you should concentrate on the dangers at hand instead of droning on about the past.~
@53324 = ~Do not feel troubled. I would much rather walk this path than any other.~ [BD53324]
@53325 = ~Your steps do lead into danger and chaos, but it is good to travel beside you. In our last battle, as I watched you move, I felt as though I was where I belonged.~ [BD53325]
@53326 = ~You were watching me during a fight?~
@53327 = ~I had no idea my form was of such interest to you, Rasaad.~
@53328 = ~That's disturbing. Don't stare at me.~
@53329 = ~I—I wasn't staring. If that is how it came across, I apologize. I only meant that when I surveyed the field, your movements caught my eye.~ [BD53329]
@53330 = ~Don't fret, Rasaad. I understood what you meant.~
@53331 = ~Are you blushing? ~
@53332 = ~If you say so. Perhaps we should change the subject.~
@53333 = ~The exertion of travel is making me flush. I've grown used to a more sedentary lifestyle. Please, excuse me.~ [BD53333]
@53334 = ~Thank you. I will speak no more of it.~ [BD53334]
@53335 = ~My apologies. I meant only to... never mind. I will speak no more.~ [BD53335]
@53336 = ~Pardon me, <CHARNAME>, but may I have a word? I will be brief.~ [BD53336]
@53337 = ~What is it, Rasaad?~
@53338 = ~Of course. I'm at your disposal.~
@53339 = ~You'd better be.~
@53340 = ~Our earlier interaction has been preying on my mind. I hope I did not truly upset you.~ [BD53340]
@53341 = ~Not at all. Think no more of the matter.~
@53342 = ~You didn't say anything terrible, Rasaad. So I caught your eye. That's not a crime.~
@53343 = ~The fact that you watch me when we're in battle doesn't upset me. If anything, it's a little flattering.~
@53344 = ~You were completely out of line. I never want to hear that sort of talk again.~
@53345 = ~I have a lot on my mind, Rasaad. Forgive me if I don't indulge in idle talk.~
@53346 = ~It gladdens me to hear it. Now I can return to my tasks with a lighter heart.~ [BD53346]
@53347 = ~You don't have to run off so quickly.~
@53348 = ~What's your hurry? I know time is of the essence, but that doesn't mean we can't talk to each other.~
@53349 = ~And I shall return to mine. Goodbye.~
@53350 = ~You wish me to stay?~ [BD53350]
@53351 = ~I always like it when you're near. You've caught my eye from time to time too.~
@53352 = ~It's difficult to be responsible for so many lives. I get tense, but you distract me.~
@53353 = ~Stay or go, as you like. I should concentrate more on my leadership duties.~
@53354 = ~I work hard to maintain my physical strength. I am glad you appreciate my discipline.~ [BD53354]
@53355 = ~I can tell. Your dedication inspires me... I mean, anyone. Everyone. You're very inspirational.~
@53356 = ~Yes, your... discipline. That's what I admire about you.~
@53357 = ~It's important that I surround myself with competent people.~
@53358 = ~You can be something of a distraction yourself.~ [BD53358]
@53359 = ~Are you teasing me?~
@53360 = ~What do you mean by that?~
@53361 = ~I don't mean to distract my followers. I should return to my duties. We can speak later.~
@53362 = ~Thank you. Now, I should concentrate on the matter at hand. We shall speak later, I am sure.~ [BD53362]
@53363 = ~Perhaps a little. For a monk, there is no greater virtue than self-control. We must learn to master our bodies and our minds. Your presence makes that difficult sometimes.~ [BD53363]
@53364 = ~You flatter me again, Rasaad.~
@53365 = ~I don't know what to say to that. You've caught me off-guard.~
@53366 = ~Let's stick to business for the moment.~
@53367 = ~For a monk, there is no greater virtue than self-control. We must learn to master our bodies and our minds. Your presence makes that difficult sometimes.~ [BD53367]
@53368 = ~You flatter me again, Rasaad.~
@53369 = ~I don't know what to say to that. You've caught me off-guard.~
@53370 = ~Let's stick to business for the moment.~
@53371 = ~I spoke indiscreetly. I should concentrate on the matter at hand. Excuse me.~ [BD53371]
@53372 = ~Of course. I will concentrate on the matter at hand.~ [BD53372]
@53373 = ~And you never will. I apologize again. We will speak no more of this.~ [BD53373]
@53374 = ~Plans progress. I see the shape of our final battle with the crusade—we can prevail.~ [BD53374]
@53375 = ~I agree. This joint endeavor is sure to succeed.~
@53376 = ~With you and I on one side, how can we fail? We make an excellent team.~
@53377 = ~I'm weary of thinking about the crusade. Distract me with more pleasant talk.~
@53378 = ~I need to concentrate on my mission, Rasaad. I can't be distracted by you any longer.~
@53379 = ~I see. If that is truly your wish, I will bother you no longer.~ [BD53379]
@53380 = ~That's not what I meant. I'm tired and see no end to this conflict. Ignore my poorly chosen words. Is there something I can help you with?~
@53381 = ~That is exactly what I wish.~
@53382 = ~I will respect your wishes. Consider us allies in a war, nothing more.~ [BD53382]
@53383 = ~I agree completely. I wanted to ask you something, since we are comrades-in-arms.~ [BD53383]
@53384 = ~Actually, I did come to distract you, though not with conversation.~ [BD53384]
@53385 = ~In the monastery, I would spar daily to keep my martial training at its peak. As we have some time to ourselves, I thought you might like to spar with me?~ [BD53385]
@53386 = ~Are you trying to get closer to me physically, Rasaad?~
@53387 = ~That's a great idea. You should probably take your shirt off. It will help you move faster, or something.~
@53388 = ~I'm sorry, but I'm simply too busy right now.~
@53389 = ~No! Wait, I—I didn't mean that to sound so vehement. I was not trying to... blast. Forget the sparring.~ [BD53389]
@53390 = ~You are a constant surprise to me, <CHARNAME>. This boldness suits you. Let us put sparring aside for a time, though.~ [BD53390]
@53391 = ~I understand.~ [BD53391]
@53392 = ~Forgive me for my audacity, but I have to ask. Is there anyone in your life who holds a place in your heart?~ [BD53392]
@53393 = ~Yes, there is. It's Neera.~
@53394 = ~I have to admit, Dorn is constantly in my thoughts.~
@53395 = ~Corwin is a beautiful woman. I think of her often.~
@53396 = ~Voghiln and I get along well. Our friendship might yet become something more.~
@53397 = ~Yes. Glint has been pursuing my affections.~
@53398 = ~No one but you, Rasaad.~
@53399 = ~I consider my mission more important than romantic entanglements. I have no lover, nor do I care to take one.~
@53400 = ~That is good, then. I am glad there is someone in your life who makes you happy. Please excuse me; I have much to do.~ [BD53400]
@53401 = ~DORN? You would let that unkempt, ill-bred... Forgive me, my words are dishonorable ones. I wish you all the happiness in the world. Please excuse me.~ [BD53401]
@53402 = ~You speak with wisdom. Tender feelings have no place in a war. Please excuse me; I have much to do.~ [BD53402]
@53403 = ~I was afraid of that. Your presence disrupts me. I find it hard to concentrate, as you are always in my thoughts. I must keep my distance from you. I am sorry. Excuse me.~ [BD53403]
@53404 = ~I dislike being so far underground. Selûne's light cannot reach into such depths.~ [BD53404]
@53405 = ~That's it? You come to me with a banal comment about how dark it is?~
@53406 = ~If this is your way of apologizing, I accept.~
@53407 = ~Yes, it's quite dark.~
@53408 = ~I do not understand what you mean.~ [BD53408]
@53409 = ~I think you do. You told me I was too "disruptive" to befriend and you haven't spoken two words to me since.~
@53410 = ~My distracting presence must have thoroughly corrupted you if you can lie to me so easily.~
@53411 = ~In that case, put it out of your mind. Let's keep at the mission.~
@53412 = ~Apologize? For what?~ [BD53412]
@53413 = ~Oh, I don't know. Maybe for telling me I was so attractive I was a distraction, as if it were my fault you can't keep me off your mind?~
@53414 = ~Don't pretend this is a big mystery, Rasaad. You gave me every sign that you were interested in me and then fled. ~
@53415 = ~If you don't know, I'm not going to tell you.~
@53416 = ~Indeed. Pitch black.~ [BD53416]
@53417 = ~Can't see my hand in front of my face.~
@53418 = ~Are we really going to do this?~
@53419 = ~I should concentrate on the mission.~
@53420 = ~Black as tar. I suppose that is the same thing as "pitch black."~ [BD53420]
@53421 = ~Pitch and tar are synonyms, yes. Well, actually, pitch is refined from tar.~
@53422 = ~That is interesting. I would think it would be the other way around.~ [BD53422]
@53423 = ~One of the guards at Candlekeep would boil down tar to make pitch for arrows. Terrible smell. ~
@53424 = ~I can imagine. At least the air down here is relatively fresh.~ [BD53424]
@53425 = ~I can't keep this up. Rasaad, this is ridiculous. ~
@53426 = ~I am sorry. I handled things badly and hurt you in the process. I did not mean to.~ [BD53426]
@53427 = ~You acted like having feelings for something was the worst thing in the world. You're so dramatic sometimes!~
@53428 = ~Your words hurt me, yes. I am how I am, Rasaad. If you find that attractive, don't deny it.~
@53429 = ~Then let's just put it behind us and concentrate on the mission.~
@53430 = ~You do not understand. Life has been different for you. Chaos is not part of your history.~ [BD53430]
@53431 = ~Did you... did you just say to a Bhaalspawn that a chaotic life isn't something they'd understand?~
@53432 = ~Where are you going with this?~
@53433 = ~Now that really stings. My life hasn't been all smooth rides and easy living.~
@53434 = ~I said your history, not your life. You had a home, a place where you belonged, even if it was only for a while. You grew up in the care of someone who loved you.~ [BD53434]
@53435 = ~I'll tell you where I'm going with this. You had a home, a place where you belonged, even if it was only for a while. You grew up in the care of someone who loved you.~
@53436 = ~After my father died, Gamaz and I were utterly on our own. Our lives were wild, dangerous things, full of scratching and striving. We breathed chaos. We slept with it at our backs.~ [BD53436]
@53437 = ~I know life was hard for you Rasaad, but things are different now.~
@53438 = ~You took that chaos and shaped it and built something new for yourself. You should be proud of that.~
@53439 = ~I fail to see how that matters, when your fortunes have changed so dramatically.~
@53440 = ~NO! I am trying to tell you. Things are NOT different. Chaos still swirls around me. It eats at me. Only through meditation and my faith can I control it.~ [BD53440]
@53441 = ~You... you break all that control to pieces just by being near me. So many feelings all at once make me... uncomfortable.~ [BD53441]
@53442 = ~Emotions are chaotic by nature, but they have to be addressed.~
@53443 = ~I could make you more comfortable if you'd let me. Here... let me put my arms around you...~
@53444 = ~Fine! If I make you so uncomfortable, then I'll keep my distance too.~
@53445 = ~Fine!~ [BD53445]
@53446 = ~You may be right. Now, though, is not the time. Let us keep moving.~ [BD53446]
@53447 = ~I could not bear to hold you now. The smell of you... No, I must focus. We have more important things to do right now. Let us keep moving.~ [BD53447]
@53448 = ~Yes. Let us keep moving.~ [BD53448]
@53449 = ~I owe you an apology.~ [BD53449]
@53450 = ~You certainly do.~
@53451 = ~No, I'm the one who should apologize.~
@53452 = ~Now is really not the time, Rasaad.~
@53453 = ~In trying to maintain control, I lost it. One of the first lessons we learn at the monastery is that the willow bends in the wind. I fought too hard against what I was feeling.~ [BD53453]
@53454 = ~I must! In trying to maintain control, I lost it. One of the first lessons we learn at the monastery is that the willow bends in the wind. I fought too hard against what I was feeling.~ [BD53454]
@53455 = ~As we near the end of our mission, with battle looming on the horizon, I feel I must say... it has been an honor fighting next to you.~ [BD53455]
@53456 = ~An honor? Nothing more?~
@53457 = ~You're right, Rasaad. The battle is almost upon us. We should leave nothing unsaid.~
@53458 = ~The honor is mine. But I must maintain my focus right now, though. There will be time to talk later.~
@53459 = ~Will there? I do not know this for sure.~ [BD53459]
@53460 = ~You know by now the way I feel. I cannot deny my feelings anymore. I should never have tried to.~ [BD53460]
@53461 = ~Nor can I deny mine. A flame sparks to life inside me whenever you are near.~
@53462 = ~That's the first sensible thing you've said. Come here.~
@53463 = ~This is not the time for words.~
@53464 = ~Yes... let me hold you now. Let me feel your mouth on mine.~ [BD53464]
@53465 = ~Would that we were alone in a glade under Selûne's majesty. I have no fear now of the battle ahead. Knowing you are at my side... I feel invincible.~ [BD53465]
@53466 = ~I know that time flees from us, but there is something I must say.~ [BD53466]
@53467 = ~You're right, we don't have much time. Still, I would listen to you.~
@53468 = ~What is it?~
@53469 = ~Speak quickly, then.~
@53470 = ~Our mission nears an end. Whatever may happen in the next few hours, know that in this moment, I am assured of our victory.~ [BD53470]
@53471 = ~As am I. We will triumph.~
@53472 = ~What makes you so sure?~
@53473 = ~Don't start the celebrations just yet. We have a lot more danger to overcome.~
@53474 = ~Ever since our last talk, I've felt... clearer. More focused. Somehow, acknowledging the wildness in my soul allowed me to put it to one side.~ [BD53474]
@53475 = ~I owe you thanks for helping me come to terms with my emotions.~ [BD53475]
@53476 = ~It was my pleasure. Honestly.~
@53477 = ~I'm glad to hear it. We'll need all our wits about us to deal with whatever lies ahead.~
@53478 = ~I only wish we'd had more time to explore your emotions. Together. Alone.~
@53479 = ~Agreed. I will return my attention to our current predicament. Just know that you as well are in my thoughts.~ [BD53479]
@53480 = ~When this is over, and the world is safe again, I will show you how deep my passion truly runs.~ [BD53480]
@53481 = ~I should have expected this.~ [BD53481]
@53482 = ~Rasaad... don't look at me like that.~
@53483 = ~What do you mean by that?~
@53484 = ~Go away. Go away! ~
@53485 = ~How? How do I look at you? What do you see in my gaze?~ [BD53485]
@53486 = ~Coldness and disdain.~
@53487 = ~This has all been a terrible misunderstanding. Please Rasaad, you have to believe me.~
@53488 = ~Leave me. I can't bear to look at you right now.~
@53489 = ~What you see when you look at me only reflects the guilt in your own heart. If you have a heart.~ [BD53489]
@53490 = ~Why? Can I not look upon the one I called friend, the one I called... something more?~ [BD53490]
@53491 = ~I don't want you to see me like this.~
@53492 = ~This has all been a terrible misunderstanding. Please Rasaad, you have to believe me.~
@53493 = ~Leave me. I can't bear to look at you right now.~
@53494 = ~What I see is what I should have seen all along.~ [BD53494]
@53495 = ~You SHOULD quail before me. My intentions were pure. My emotions were real. YOU were the one who led me astray.~ [BD53495]
@53496 = ~A misunderstanding? It was a misunderstanding that plunged a dagger into Skie's body, was it? Do not take me for a fool.~ [BD53496]
@53497 = ~Someone who gives in to any whim or desire that crosses their mind cannot be trusted. This I knew. I ignored my rational thoughts and allowed my feelings to grow.~ [BD53497]
@53498 = ~We did nothing wrong, Rasaad. Whatever you believe of me now, I never lied to you.~
@53499 = ~If you honestly believe I could murder Skie in cold blood, then there was never anything real between us.~
@53500 = ~You wanted us to be together as much as I did. Don't make this out to be my fault.~
@53501 = ~Perhaps you are right. Perhaps everything that passed between us was an illusion.~ [BD53501]
@53502 = ~Should we ever cross paths again, you will be as a stranger to me. I will be cool and unmoving as a glacier before you.~ [BD53502]
@53503 = ~I was a fool to believe love could ever grow in a Bhaalspawn's heart.~ [BD53503]
@53504 = ~Nature, pah. Who needs it? Twigs in my hair, bugs flying around my face. Give me a city any day.~ [BD53504]
@53505 = ~Exactly what I was thinking.~
@53506 = ~It might be annoying at times, but nature can also be beautiful.~
@53507 = ~Stop whining and pay attention. There could be an ambush behind every tree.~
@53508 = ~Is that so? Tell me, what else are you thinking about?~ [BD53508]
@53509 = ~My mission. It weighs heavily on my mind.~
@53510 = ~You, Safana.~
@53511 = ~What do you think I'm thinking about?~
@53512 = ~Me, of course.~ [BD53512]
@53513 = ~Supposing I am really on your mind... what exactly is it about me that occupies your thoughts?~ [BD53513]
@53514 = ~Your beauty. You look more lovely than the flowers springing from the ground.~
@53515 = ~Your charm. I find you more intoxicating than honey mead.~
@53516 = ~Your knack of striking up conversations precisely when we need to be quiet and keep focused.~
@53517 = ~You think this is beautiful, hmm? Anything else in the area that catches your eye?~ [BD53517]
@53518 = ~You do. You look more lovely than the flowers springing from the ground.~
@53519 = ~You know what a beautiful woman you are, Safana. You don't need me to tell you.~
@53520 = ~Nope.~
@53521 = ~Is THAT the best you can do? I've been complimented with far more grace and authenticity. Your compliment is so pedestrian, it almost sounds like an insult.~ [BD53521]
@53522 = ~I'm sorry?~
@53523 = ~You're actually going to criticize my compliment?~
@53524 = ~I should have known better than to show you an ounce of kindness, harpy.~
@53525 = ~Come back to me when you've thought of something truly complimentary to say and maybe I'll listen.~ [BD53525]
@53526 = ~How tedious. Isn't there anything else around to think about?~ [BD53526]
@53527 = ~There's you, Safana.~
@53528 = ~Fishing for compliments doesn't suit you.~
@53529 = ~Nothing. I have to concentrate on the task at hand, not make idle conversation with the likes of you.~
@53530 = ~Brute! You think you can talk to me like that? You'd better think of something flattering to say about me or I will make you regret the day you joined up with me!~ [BD53530]
@53531 = ~Well? Have you thought about what you said to me?~ [BD53531]
@53532 = ~I have, and I've figured out what I should have said. ~
@53533 = ~You might have crossed my mind once or twice.~
@53534 = ~You mean nothing whatsoever to me, so no.~
@53535 = ~Aaaaannnnd...?~ [BD53535]
@53536 = ~Safana, you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. Your hair is like the softest silk and your eyes sparkle like precious jewels.~
@53537 = ~You're a valuable companion and your skills are unmatched. You can open a lock with a sidelong glance and hide in the shadow of a halfling. I don't know what I'd do without you.~
@53538 = ~I can't get you out of my head. You're like an annoying tune that won't go away until finally it drives you stark raving mad.~
@53539 = ~I can't believe this. Are you being serious?~ [BD53539]
@53540 = ~No, I'm just teasing you.~
@53541 = ~Dead serious. I care nothing at all for you and I'd prefer it if you kept our conversations strictly business from now on.~
@53542 = ~Sweetheart, you don't know what you're missing out on.~ [BD53542]
@53543 = ~Teasing me, huh? I can tease you too, and with a lot more skill, I'd bet.~ [BD53543]
@53544 = ~That's... not bad. I mean, I've heard better, but I guess you haven't had a lot of practice.~ [BD53544]
@53545 = ~What are you talking about? That was an incredible compliment!~
@53546 = ~I do just fine with the ladies, thank you very much.~
@53547 = ~You are truly insufferable.~
@53548 = ~I'll tell you what. Next time we talk, I want a present. A gemstone, a piece of jewelry... something that shows me how special I am. Something valuable. You can do that, can't you?~ [BD53548]
@53549 = ~I'll find something, though it won't be half as beautiful as you.~
@53550 = ~We're looking at a war on the horizon and you want some glittery gift?~
@53551 = ~You really are a bloodsucker, aren't you?~
@53552 = ~Flatterer. Get along now; find something good to give me.~ [BD53552]
@53553 = ~You're starting to get the picture, sweetheart. Now go on; find me something sparkly to match my eyes.~ [BD53553]
@53554 = ~And you're an obnoxious creep! If that's the way you want it, I'll keep things strictly business from now on. But you don't know what you're missing out on.~ [BD53554]
@53555 = ~Hey there, sweetheart. How's it going?~ [BD53555]
@53556 = ~It's going... well. There's a lot to carry on my shoulders, but I'll manage.~
@53557 = ~Not bad, thank you for asking.~
@53558 = ~You're acting interested in my well-being. I'm suspicious.~
@53559 = ~Since you replied to me, I can only assume that means you got my present!~ [BD53559]
@53560 = ~Before you show me, though, I need to know something. I'm a one-man woman. Are you a one-woman man?~ [BD53560]
@53561 = ~Actually, I'm finding myself drawn to Neera.~
@53562 = ~To tell you the truth, Corwin is often in my thoughts.~
@53563 = ~Glint and I are becoming more than friends.~
@53564 = ~Dorn is the only one with claim on my heart.~
@53565 = ~I find Viconia very intriguing.~
@53566 = ~There's no one but you, Safana.~
@53567 = ~I can't think about romance with anyone right now. Not with a war going on.~
@53568 = ~That's what I wanted to hear, sweetheart. So? Where's my present?~ [BD53568]
@53569 = ~I brought you this bloodstone amulet. Red, like my beating heart.~
@53570 = ~I brought you an angel skin ring, though your skin is fairer than any angel's.~
@53571 = ~Would you like this sphene gem? It brings out your eyes.~
@53572 = ~Here, take this black opal. You deserve something so beautiful.~
@53573 = ~This water opal deserves an owner as radiant as it is.~
@53574 = ~Take this moonbar gem with my affection.~
@53575 = ~This fire opal ring made me think of you, as you are full of fire and spirit.~
@53576 = ~Nothing I've found yet has been worthy of a woman as magnificent as you.~
@53577 = ~Were you serious about that? I thought you were kidding. I'm not getting you a gift.~
@53578 = ~Let me see... my, my. This is a pretty trinket. You've done well.~ [BD53578]
@53579 = ~It was an easy task to accomplish with the thought of you spurring me on.~
@53580 = ~Don't read too much into this. It amused me to give you a gift, that's all.~
@53581 = ~Charmer. Come over here for a minute... Let me thank you properly.~ [BD53581]
@53582 = ~Yes, Safana. This is what I've wanted. ~
@53583 = ~You taste amazing.~
@53584 = ~You have the wrong idea. I was being kind to you as a friend.~
@53585 = ~Mmm... now, now... that's enough. If you want more of my kisses, you'll have to do something for me...~ [BD53585]
@53586 = ~How disappointing. I thought you really wanted to please me. I would have made you very happy in return.~ [BD53586]
@53587 = ~Would you really? Or would you have laughed at me and put me off again?~
@53588 = ~Let me show you how much I want to please you.~
@53589 = ~You're a nice person, Safana. I like you. You don't have to play this game with me.~
@53590 = ~You'll never know now, will you?~ [BD53590]
@53591 = ~You don't know anything about the real me. How could you possibly like me?~ [BD53591]
@53592 = ~I know enough. We've traveled together for some time. I respect your skills and know I can count on you. That's all I need.~
@53593 = ~You're the most luscious woman I've ever seen. Believe me, I like you.~
@53594 = ~You're right. I don't know you at all. I don't know why I'm even thinking about getting involved with you.~
@53595 = ~Oh... oh, I see what you mean. Of course I—I can't argue with that. Sweetheart.~ [BD53595]
@53596 = ~Don't be a sap. I was going to ask you to write me a poem, but now I'm afraid it'll be sweet enough to rot my teeth. Write one, don't write one. I don't care.~ [BD53596]
@53597 = ~You can't mean that. You wouldn't want to miss out on all the fun I can show you. I'm a wild ride, sweetheart.~ [BD53597]
@53598 = ~I don't want to miss a second with you. What can I do to prove that you're who I want?~
@53599 = ~I'm getting off the ride right now.~
@53600 = ~Your loss, champ. Don't come crawling over to my bedroll in the middle of the night when you change your mind.~ [BD53600]
@53601 = ~You need to do a little more work. What I really want is... a poem. Yes, a love poem. All about ME.~ [BD53601]
@53602 = ~You'll have one as soon as I can put my heart onto paper.~
@53603 = ~I don't know if I can write a poem, but I'll try.~
@53604 = ~A love poem? We're in a war!~
@53605 = ~Give it your best effort, sweetheart.~ [BD53605]
@53606 = ~I can't wait to read it. Just be sure you do a good job.~ [BD53606]
@53607 = ~And what, you thought you'd just string me along? Not gonna happen, champ. I'm not the girl for you.~ [BD53607]
@53608 = ~You can't mean that. You wouldn't want to miss out on all the fun I can show you. I'm a wild ride.~ [BD53608]
@53609 = ~What I'm trying to say is I find the war distracting. But you're distracting too. I don't want this to end.~
@53610 = ~I'm getting off the ride right now.~
@53611 = ~I hear you may need the services of a skald, ja? You are to be composing a poem for the lovely Safana?~ [BD53611]
@53612 = ~Perhaps. I need to write Safana a love poem, but I'm reasonably sure she wants me to write it myself.~
@53613 = ~A beautiful verse for a beautiful lady! That is a great task, and you can be certain.~ [BD53613]
@53614 = ~Could you write it for me? What Safana doesn't know won't hurt her. ~
@53615 = ~I was hoping you could give me some tips. ~
@53616 = ~Never mind, I'll figure this out on my own.~
@53617 = ~Ink would flow from mine pen were I to write about one such as her. That hair... those lips. Oh! She is a woman to hold on to with both hands.~ [BD53617]
@53618 = ~Yes, she's certainly a handful.~
@53619 = ~Could you write the poem for me? Just be sure Safana doesn't find out; she'd be furious.~
@53620 = ~Could you help me write a poem?~
@53621 = ~There, see? You are a wordsmith already! Ha!~ [BD53621]
@53622 = ~Never mind, I'll figure this out on my own. ~
@53623 = ~Consider it done, mine friend. I write poems of love more than any other kind. Let me take pen and paper and...~ [BD53623]
@53624 = ~There! An ode to the buxom beauty! With this in hand, you are sure to win her over.~ [BD53624]
@53625 = ~All you need to do is look inside your own heart. What does it say to you? What does it whisper about your beloved?~ [BD53625]
@53626 = ~She's not my beloved.~
@53627 = ~My heart is often a dark thing. I don't think I should listen too closely.~
@53628 = ~You're not making any sense.~
@53629 = ~I cannot tell you what to write. She would recognize mine words at once. Speak what you truly feel, and it will be a poem.~ [BD53629]
@53630 = ~Oh, and do not end any of your lines with "orange." Not a good idea.~ [BD53630]
@53631 = ~As you like, my companion.~
@53632 = ~Well, hello again, skald of my heart.~ [BD53632]
@53633 = ~Safana. You're looking particularly lovely today.~
@53634 = ~What an oh-so-subtle way to bring up that love poem you requested.~
@53635 = ~I'm a little busy right now, Safana. Can this wait?~
@53636 = ~Let me think... No. It can't.~ [BD53636]
@53637 = ~You know what's on my mind. You've had ample time to arrange your feelings in the form of verse.~ [BD53637]
@53638 = ~I have it written down on this piece of parchment right here.~
@53639 = ~It's not very polished, but I have some lines in mind.~
@53640 = ~I don't have time to talk to you. Get back to your position and stop bothering me.~
@53641 = ~Let's hear it!~ [BD53641]
@53642 = ~Our eyes met when you strolled into my life,~
@53643 = ~Your gaze as sharp and piercing as a dart.~
@53644 = ~The light made your eyes shine like precious gemstones,~
@53645 = ~And with that single look you stole my heart.~
@53646 = ~Let's hear it!~ [BD53641]
@53647 = ~Of course. I'll just read it off this parchment... ahem...~
@53648 = ~Why, <CHARNAME>, that was beautiful! It didn't sound like you at all. Did you really write that?~ [BD53648]
@53649 = ~I did, and I meant every word.~
@53650 = ~I have to confess; I didn't write this. I asked Voghiln to do it for me.~
@53651 = ~Voghiln? The bard who always has a cup in his hand? Hm, he's more talented than I thought.~ [BD53651]
@53652 = ~But I meant every word, Safana. I just didn't want to disappoint you.~
@53653 = ~He's all right. Now that I've seen his work, I probably would have done better on my own.~
@53654 = ~You're missing the greater point, which is how impressively resourceful I am.~
@53655 = ~I'm not displeased. Perhaps I'll give you a kiss later to thank you.~ [BD53655]
@53656 = ~Why not right now? Surely I've earned one by now. Come here.~
@53657 = ~If that's what you want.~
@53658 = ~I'll think of nothing else.~
@53659 = ~Now, now, don't beg, sweetheart. It's not becoming.~ [BD53659]
@53660 = ~<CHARNAME>, I... I wasn't expecting that.~ [BD53660]
@53661 = ~Didn't you like it?~
@53662 = ~I meant every word.~
@53663 = ~Don't tell me. You're disappointed in me. Again.~
@53664 = ~No, I...! I mean, I liked it. Somewhat. It was appealing. ~
@53665 = ~You caught me by surprise is all. I didn't know you had such a romantic spirit. Perhaps I'll give you a kiss later to thank you.~ [BD53665]
@53666 = ~Why not right now? I've earned one, haven't I? One at least, I'd think. Come here.~
@53667 = ~If that's what you want.~
@53668 = ~I'll think of nothing else.~
@53669 = ~We'll talk later then... darling.~ [BD53669]
@53670 = ~Oh, I'll leave you alone. You can count on it.~ [BD53670]
@53671 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>. Something I can do for you?~ [BD53671]
@53672 = ~This mission is a difficult one. I wanted to see how you were doing.~
@53673 = ~You mentioned a kiss earlier...~
@53674 = ~Nothing at the moment. I just wanted to be near you.~
@53675 = ~That's sweet.~ [BD53675]
@53676 = ~Is there something wrong? You seem... distant.~
@53677 = ~Not as sweet as a kiss would be.~
@53678 = ~Yes. I know.~
@53679 = ~There is something I feel you should know. Don't get that look on your face; it's not the end of the world.~ [BD53679]
@53680 = ~The fact of the matter is, you're a terrible kisser.~ [BD53680]
@53681 = ~What? Why are you saying this?~
@53682 = ~Are you trying to upset me?~
@53683 = ~Oh really? I might well say the same of you.~
@53684 = ~It's nothing you can't work on, but you've left me cold. All that bumbling about, trying pathetically to make love to me... it was embarrassing.~ [BD53684]
@53685 = ~I don't know what to say.~
@53686 = ~Ah. I understand. I got too close to you. That's why you're lashing out.~
@53687 = ~You try to shame me, you wretched trollop? YOU?~
@53688 = ~Ha! Well, I guess I can also tell you the last time we were at camp, I shared a glass of wine with Voghiln after you went to sleep.~ [BD53688]
@53689 = ~He knew how to compliment a woman, that's for sure. I rewarded him with a kiss... or two... or three. We had to keep it quiet since you were in the tent right next to us.~ [BD53689]
@53690 = ~The wine and her beauty intoxicated me both. I am sorry...~ [BD53690]
@53691 = ~So now that you know the truth you can stop pestering me.~ [BD53691]
@53692 = ~You'll not put me off that easily, Safana. We aren't going to end like this. I won't allow it.~
@53693 = ~Oh, I'll stop pestering you. I'll never speak to you again.~
@53694 = ~We're done, you cold-hearted harpy. Begone! I never want to see you again!~
@53695 = ~Get it through your thick skull, champ. It's over.~ [BD53695]
@53696 = ~Fine by me. I'm sure Voghiln will be my conversational partner whenever I like.~ [BD53696]
@53697 = ~Don't be so sore about it, champ. You need me right now. If you still feel this way in a bit, you can kick me onto the street. Wouldn't be the first time.~ [BD53697]
@53698 = ~I must really be tired. I didn't hear you walk up at all.~ [BD53698]
@53699 = ~We've been at this mission for a long time. Is there anything I can do?~
@53700 = ~I'm not surprised—I'm tired too. We can rest if you'd like.~
@53701 = ~Sleep when you're dead, Safana. I need you on top of your game. ~
@53702 = ~No, no. I'm fine. Nothing keeps me down for long.~ [BD53702]
@53703 = ~If there's anything I can be sure about, Safana, it's that no matter what life throws at you, you'll come out the victor.~
@53704 = ~You're one of the strongest people I've ever met. I know you'll be okay.~
@53705 = ~Nothing keeps you quiet for long either. Can we keep moving?~
@53706 = ~That's a really nice compliment, <CHARNAME>. Thank you. You're a survivor too. I guess that's why I like you.~ [BD53706]
@53707 = ~My life hasn't been easy, it's true. But having someone like you with me makes the hard times seem worth it.~
@53708 = ~Do my ears deceive me? Are you the real Safana or have you been replaced by a very pleasant doppelganger?~
@53709 = ~We do work well together. And fit well together. Come here, beautiful lady.~
@53710 = ~You could charm the pants off... well, off of ME, if you keep talking like that. Get over here.~ [BD53710]
@53711 = ~Gentle kisses, darling. I need something sweet and soft today. Like this... and this...~ [BD53711]
@53712 = ~We should keep moving. I want you to know... I mean I think that... forget it. Thank you.~ [BD53712]
@53713 = ~You're the boss.~ [BD53713]
@53714 = ~Very funny. You should be performing in Waterdeep with that finely honed sense of humor.~ [BD53714]
@53715 = ~More trudging. More danger. What a joy.~ [BD53715]
@53716 = ~At least we'll face the danger together.~
@53717 = ~I know it's been a hard slog, but it should be over soon.~
@53718 = ~Victory is close at hand, Safana.~
@53719 = ~Is that supposed to make me feel better? Gods, you are such an idiot sometimes.~ [BD53719]
@53720 = ~It's all right. I'm anxious too. But I promise we'll get through this.~
@53721 = ~Is that all it takes to bring out your claws? ~
@53722 = ~An idiot for getting involved with you, perhaps.~
@53723 = ~Oh, you haven't seen my claws yet. Don't turn your back on me or you might.~ [BD53723]
@53724 = ~Hells, I can't argue with you there. Come on, let's do this.~ [BD53724]
@53725 = ~I'm not anxious—I'm terrified. That's a portal to Hell! We'll never survive.~ [BD53725]
@53726 = ~Yes, we will. Look at me. I promise, we'll make it out alive.~
@53727 = ~I don't blame you for being scared, but we've handled every other danger we've faced. We'll handle this one.~
@53728 = ~I didn't expect you to fall apart so easily, Safana. You've disappointed me.~
@53729 = ~Maybe I've disappointed myself. Come on, let's do this.~ [BD53729]
@53730 = ~I'm sorry, I shouldn't have snapped like that. I hope this is over quickly so that you and I can...~ [BD53730]
@53731 = ~Funny. I always thought in this sort of situation I'd be on the other side of the bars.~ [BD53731]
@53732 = ~Safana, this isn't what it looks like. You have to believe me.~
@53733 = ~To be honest, so did I.~
@53734 = ~Did you come here to mock me?~
@53735 = ~Believing you is what got me INTO this mess in the first place!~ [BD53735]
@53736 = ~Really? You give me attitude at a time like this?~ [BD53736]
@53737 = ~Maybe I did. Maybe you DESERVE it.~ [BD53737]
@53738 = ~I shouldn't be surprised but, damn it, I am. You really had me fooled, champ. One hundred percent sucker, that's me.~ [BD53738]
@53739 = ~You're not a sucker, Safana. I meant everything I said to you.~
@53740 = ~I didn't mean to hurt you. And I didn't murder Skie. ~
@53741 = ~If you're not even going to listen to what I have to say, you might as well leave.~
@53742 = ~Oh, I'm sure! I'm sure you truly loved me and this is all a horrible misunderstanding! Right?~ [BD53742]
@53743 = ~You don't get to tell me what to do.~ [BD53743]
@53744 = ~You're lower than scum. You should have stayed in Hell where you belonged, you canker-blossom. I hope you rot in jail forever, you worthless scut.~ [BD53744]
@53745 = ~Safana, please. You're breaking my heart.~
@53746 = ~Give me a chance to prove my innocence.~
@53747 = ~I don't even know what half those words mean.~
@53748 = ~A joker till the end. Guess the joke's on me.~ [BD53748]
@53749 = ~I'm done with you. You took advantage of my... my weakness, and I'll never forget it. Heck, maybe I'll use some of your techniques next time I con a sucker.~ [BD53749]
@53750 = ~Funny. I always thought in this sort of situation I'd be on the other side of the bars.~ [BD53731]
@53751 = ~Maybe I do. I don't know. It doesn't matter.~ [BD53751]
@53752 = ~Ha! Attitude at a time like this. I like it.~ [BD53752]
@53753 = ~There is something I feel you should know. Don't get that look on your face; it's not the end of the world.~ [BD53753]
@53754 = ~The fact of the matter is, you're a terrible kisser.~ [BD53680]
@53755 = ~What? Why are you saying this?~
@53756 = ~Are you trying to upset me?~
@53757 = ~I was expecting a little more from you too.~
@53758 = ~It's nothing you can't work on, but you've left me cold. All that bumbling about, trying pathetically to make love to me... it was embarrassing.~ [BD53684]
@53759 = ~You came to visit me in jail to tell me THIS?~
@53760 = ~Did I get too close to you? Is that why you're lashing out?~
@53761 = ~You're the pathetic one.~
@53762 = ~Ha! Well, I guess I can also tell you the last time we were at camp, I shared a glass of wine with Voghiln after you went to sleep.~ [BD53688]
@53763 = ~He knew how to compliment a woman, that's for sure. I rewarded him with a kiss... or two... or three. We had to keep it quiet since you were in the tent right next to us.~ [BD53689]
@53764 = ~I just wanted you to know the truth before I left you to rot in this jail cell.~ [BD53764]
@53765 = ~Don't let it end like this, Safana. I did have true feelings for you. Let me out of here.~
@53766 = ~I'll do better than that. I'll never speak to you again. When I get out of here, and I WILL, you'll be dead to me.~
@53767 = ~We could have been really good together, doll.~
@53768 = ~Get it through your thick skull, champ. It's over.~ [BD53768]
@53769 = ~Once again, our fates intertwine. It seems I cannot go any length of time without being made to endure the company of surfacers.~ [BD53769]
@53770 = ~I would hope my companionship is not so distasteful as you make it sound.~
@53771 = ~Admit it. You love traveling with me. I'm exciting!~
@53772 = ~You're free to leave whenever you want.~
@53773 = ~It is the necessity of your company that leaves me unsettled.~ [BD53773]
@53774 = ~If I craved excitement, I would have remained on my own in this hostile land.~ [BD53774]
@53775 = ~Am I truly? You mean to say no chains hold me here, and that is true. But to choose freedom is to court death.~ [BD53775]
@53776 = ~Surface-dwellers are, at best, wary of drow. At worst, they attack on sight. Though I have proven myself capable to some, still they do not trust me.~ [BD53776]
@53777 = ~What brought you this way in the first place?~
@53778 = ~The people I call allies are good people, Viconia. They wouldn't hurt you.~
@53779 = ~I have to get back to my duties. Please excuse me.~
@53780 = ~It is a long story. One I will tell you another time, if it suits me. Suffice to say I was forced to leave my last place of residence and was seeking a new place to settle.~ [BD53780]
@53781 = ~I came here for my own reasons, but they are no longer enough to keep me here. I had thought... It matters not what I thought.~ [BD53781]
@53782 = ~You sound disappointed.~
@53783 = ~You can be sure the people I call allies are honorable. They wouldn't hurt you.~
@53784 = ~That's very interesting, but I have to return to my duties.~
@53785 = ~Men believe they are the masters when they take a woman to their bed, but they quickly become the pawns. I survive more easily when males serve me.~ [BD53785]
@53786 = ~I appreciate your pragmatism. You're a strong woman, Viconia.~
@53787 = ~I'm shocked you would barter away your favors so readily.~
@53788 = ~This male has other people to serve at the moment. Please excuse me.~
@53789 = ~Honor means something very different to surface-dwellers than it does to me. Can you say there is no one here who would consider it honorable to torture and murder a drow?~ [BD53789]
@53790 = ~Yes, I can. I have faith in these men and women.~
@53791 = ~I suppose I can't. Many of my kind see drow as monsters. I hope you know that I don't.~
@53792 = ~Your people are evil and depraved. If I didn't need your talents, I wouldn't keep you around.~
@53793 = ~You raise a valid point. Let us speak of something else. What brought you to this place?~
@53794 = ~Poor babe, so innocent here in the wild. Watch yourself, lest your surface beasts tear you to pieces.~ [BD53794]
@53795 = ~I learned long ago to survive on my own. It is easier when I travel with you, which is why I'm here. But I do not trust you, no. I cannot.~ [BD53795]
@53796 = ~I see you are no different from these other surface-dwellers. I shall remember this insult.~ [BD53796]
@53797 = ~As you wish.~ [BD53797]
@53798 = ~I'm pleased that you see it that way. It's not often surface-dwellers can understand the ways of the drow.~ [BD53798]
@53799 = ~So many Flaming Fist officers around. They bring back unpleasant memories.~ [BD53799]
@53800 = ~Remembering the time we met?~
@53801 = ~They're here to protect all of us.~
@53802 = ~Don't be a coward, Viconia. I need you to stay sharp.~
@53803 = ~Yes. The mercenary dog hunted me for days before I encountered you. I'm fortunate you took an interest in my fate.~ [BD53803]
@53804 = ~You didn't deserve to be hunted like that. I'm glad I was able to help.~
@53805 = ~You were certainly in a lot of trouble without me. I'm surprised you've survived on your own.~
@53806 = ~The Flaming Fist are a bunch of bullies with too much time on their hands. They're cowards who only attack people they're sure they can defeat.~
@53807 = ~Oh, are they? I shall rest much better at night knowing they are here to protect me and not to run me through the first chance they get.~ [BD53807]
@53808 = ~You're being sarcastic, aren't you?~
@53809 = ~They're doing their jobs, Viconia. They may be suspicious of you, but their intentions are good.~
@53810 = ~I know the Flaming Fist soldiers can be thickheaded at times... bullies, even. They can be cowardly and mean and get a kick out of hurting innocents... where was I going with this?~
@53811 = ~If I had not met you, I would have found some other way to survive. I am used to holding on to my life with both hands.~ [BD53811]
@53812 = ~I don't doubt it. You're one of the most tenacious women I know.~
@53813 = ~Ha! That mercenary would have killed you on the spot if it weren't for me.~
@53814 = ~I only know what did happen, and I'm glad I was there for you.~
@53815 = ~Your mind remains sharp as a sword's edge, rivvil.~ [BD53815]
@53816 = ~Your attempts at humor are amusing at times, abban. Yes, they are cowards at heart, and we will deal with them if they turn on us.~ [BD53816]
@53817 = ~Oloth plynn nind! Do you truly believe your own drivel?~ [BD53817]
@53818 = ~I see you are no different from these other surface-dwellers. I shall remember this insult.~ [BD53818]
@53819 = ~I appreciate the sentiment. Shall we press on?~ [BD53819]
@53820 = ~He still remains devoted to his wife after all this time.~ [BD53820]
@53821 = ~Who, Khalid?~
@53822 = ~What are you talking about?~
@53823 = ~Some of us are capable of forming lasting relationships, Viconia.~
@53824 = ~Khalid... though he be a bumbling weakling in so many ways, he does understand loyalty.~
@53825 = ~I disagree with your evaluation of him, but yes, he is still devoted to Jaheira.~
@53826 = ~If he let go of his love for Jaheira, he would have nothing at all.~
@53827 = ~Does that surprise you? ~
@53828 = ~That cowardly half-elf who once traveled with you. Is he still devoted to his wife?~ [BD53828]
@53829 = ~Who, Khalid?~
@53830 = ~What are you talking about?~
@53831 = ~Some of us are capable of forming lasting relationships, Viconia.~
@53832 = ~The arrow flies! Do you intend to sting me with your banal words?~ [BD53832]
@53833 = ~I only meant that it can be difficult for wanderers such as us to form long-lasting attachments.~
@53834 = ~If it keeps you from bothering me with your prattle, then yes.~
@53835 = ~I see you are no different from these other surface-dwellers. I shall remember this insult.~ [BD53835]
@53836 = ~It is strange to think of romance in a time of war. Tell me, are there any who have imprisoned your heart?~ [BD53836]
@53837 = ~Actually, I'm finding myself drawn to Neera.~
@53838 = ~To tell you the truth, Corwin is often in my thoughts.~
@53839 = ~Glint and I are becoming more than friends.~
@53840 = ~Dorn is the only one with claim on my heart.~
@53841 = ~I find Safana very intriguing.~
@53842 = ~No one but you, Viconia.~
@53843 = ~No one special.~
@53844 = ~Really? I would not have guessed. I wish you luck in wooing that one.~ [BD53844]
@53845 = ~Idiot! I'm not interested in your heart. You presume too much, surface-dweller.~ [BD53845]
@53846 = ~I see. Perhaps someone will yet come along to win the Bhaalspawn's love.~ [BD53846]
@53847 = ~We should move quickly, abbil. I dislike being underground.~ [BD53847]
@53848 = ~I thought you liked the dark.~
@53849 = ~Afraid, Viconia?~
@53850 = ~We're moving as quickly as we can. We'll be out soon, I promise.~
@53851 = ~Idiot! I am not so arrogant as to think I have nothing to fear from the Spider Queen. I turned my back on her, and that is not done lightly.~ [BD53851]
@53852 = ~You worship Shar now, isn't that right?~
@53853 = ~Then put your fear aside and focus on the mission. You're making everyone jumpy.~
@53854 = ~Do you think we're in danger?~
@53855 = ~I do. My faith lies now with Shar the Nightsinger. I find the dark... soothing. The shadows remind me of the sweet oblivion to come after death.~ [BD53855]
@53856 = ~That sounds... peaceful.~
@53857 = ~Why did you change faiths?~
@53858 = ~That's very interesting, but we don't have time to talk now. Let's keep moving.~
@53859 = ~To one who has spent so long running, hiding, scratching, and scraping to keep my body and soul alive, the quiet of eternal darkness after death seems very peaceful indeed.~ [BD53859]
@53860 = ~Why did you change faiths?~
@53861 = ~Do you think we're in danger?~
@53862 = ~That's very interesting, but we don't have time to talk now. Let's keep moving.~
@53863 = ~That is a long story I do not feel like retelling. Suffice to say, the Spider Queen asked more of me than I could give. When I lost everything and found myself abandoned in the darkness, that is when I heard Shar whisper to me.~ [BD53863]
@53864 = ~The Spider Queen may send her minions after us, but we're strong enough to defeat any challenge.~
@53865 = ~Let's hurry, then. I wouldn't want to face the Spider Queen's minions down here. We'd be killed for sure, or worse.~
@53866 = ~What a tedious tale. If you're done jumping at shadows, let's move on.~
@53867 = ~We are always in danger, abbil. Danger walks at our shoulders. Will the Spider Queen send agents after us? Perhaps.~ [BD53867]
@53868 = ~We are always in danger, abbil. Danger walks at our shoulders. Will the Spider Queen send agents after us? Perhaps. We have already met some of her servants. She knew me.~ [BD53868]
@53869 = ~I admire your bravery, <CHARNAME>. Yes, let us press on.~ [BD53869]
@53870 = ~Your courage wilts so quickly, male. It makes me smile to see you tremble like a mouse.~ [BD53870]
@53871 = ~I see you are no different from these other surface-dwellers. I shall remember this insult.~ [BD53871]
@53872 = ~As you wish.~ [BD53872]
@53873 = ~Ibilth! My boots are worn down to the skin of my feet we've been walking so long.~ [BD53873]
@53874 = ~You're doing well, Viconia. I'm impressed by your fortitude.~
@53875 = ~We wouldn't have gotten this far if it hadn't been for you. Thank you.~
@53876 = ~The time would pass more quickly if you'd stop complaining every three steps.~
@53877 = ~Do not try to placate me with hollow compliments!~ [BD53877]
@53878 = ~It wasn't a hollow compliment. I meant what I said.~
@53879 = ~I'd ask "is something wrong?", but it's pretty obvious that something's wrong.~
@53880 = ~I'm very sorry, Viconia. I didn't mean to upset you.~
@53881 = ~If that's the way you feel, I can promise you not another compliment will ever pass my lips.~
@53882 = ~What are you trying to accomplish with your flattery?~ [BD53882]
@53883 = ~I'm not going to dignify that with a response. Get angry if you want, but I won't apologize for speaking my mind.~
@53884 = ~My nefarious goal is to "make conversation" while simultaneously "being nice to you." Dastardly, isn't it?~
@53885 = ~It's clear I upset you. Whatever I did wrong, I'm sorry.~
@53886 = ~You're being ridiculous. If that's the way you feel, I'll remain silent the rest of the trip.~
@53887 = ~Wonderful! The male can learn!~ [BD53887]
@53888 = ~Cease your whinging. You sicken me, pup.~ [BD53888]
@53889 = ~I would prefer if we simply cease conversation for the time being. I shall not complain about my feet again.~ [BD53889]
@53890 = ~If we must pass into a world of fiends and fire, I am glad it is this one.~ [BD53890]
@53891 = ~You're GLAD that we're going to the Nine Hells?~
@53892 = ~Is there another hell we could be going to?~
@53893 = ~Now is not the time for speech, Viconia. It is time for action.~
@53894 = ~Believe me, I am not glad to be facing this portal. But were we to step into the Abyss, Lolth would strike me down in a heartbeat.~ [BD53894]
@53895 = ~So if it were the Abyss, we would be doomed, but since it's only the Nine Hells, you believe we'll be all right?~
@53896 = ~That's an optimistic way of looking at things, I suppose.~
@53897 = ~Now is not the time for speech, Viconia. It is time for action.~
@53898 = ~If I stood next to anyone else, I would consider myself lost no matter what lay on the other side of that portal. But because it is you, I am confident.~ [BD53898]
@53899 = ~That may be the nicest thing you've ever said to me. Or possibly anyone.~
@53900 = ~I feel the same way about you, Viconia.~
@53901 = ~You really think we will succeed?~
@53902 = ~Do not get accustomed to soft words from me.~ [BD53902]
@53903 = ~At this point, you have no choice but to rely on me, so it serves you well to flatter me. Still, I appreciate the compliment.~ [BD53903]
@53904 = ~You may think me an idiot, but in this moment, I do.~ [BD53904]
@53905 = ~You surprised me, abbil. I thought our alliance would prove tedious, but you've shown yourself to be not quite as bad as I'd thought.~ [BD53905]
@53906 = ~Thank you?~
@53907 = ~You can never give a straight compliment, can you, Viconia? There's always venom lurking beneath your honey.~
@53908 = ~I'm so flattered. Really, what a staggering compliment. Give me a second to sit down and absorb it all.~
@53909 = ~I know you don't pay honest compliments to people very often, Viconia. I appreciate your comment.~
@53910 = ~Shall we quarrel before the gates of Hell themselves? Enough talk. Let us face our fate.~ [BD53910]
@53911 = ~It is difficult for me to speak my mind at times so that surface-dwellers understand me. I do not feel things as you do. I meant my statement to be flattering.~ [BD53911]
@53912 = ~I understand. Thank you.~
@53913 = ~It's not hard to pay someone a compliment, Viconia. You should practice more often.~
@53914 = ~We do seem to speak different languages at times. Still, I thank you for the effort.~
@53915 = ~I'm sorry too for my earlier outburst. I was... tense.~ [BD53915]
@53916 = ~Don't worry about it.~
@53917 = ~We're all tense. I can forgive a little snappishness now and then.~
@53918 = ~You should be sorry. You were incredibly rude. Let's put it behind us and keep moving.~
@53919 = ~It is customary, I think, to share a kiss for luck?~ [BD53919]
@53920 = ~I'm not sure whose custom that is, but I'm all for it.~
@53921 = ~I'd like that, Viconia.~
@53922 = ~I'd prefer to focus on the battle at hand. Let's press on.~
@53923 = ~Lead on, abbil.~ [BD53923]
@53924 = ~I never thought to see you like this, abbil. Blood on your hands and fear in your eyes. I thought you to be more clever.~ [BD53924]
@53925 = ~You don't believe I killed Skie Silvershield, do you?~
@53926 = ~Did you come here to taunt me or are you going to help me out of here?~
@53927 = ~I'm in no mood for idle chatter.~
@53928 = ~Why should I not? You have chaos in your blood. This I understand. The girl was no great loss to us. A fitting sacrifice.~ [BD53928]
@53929 = ~You're a monster.~
@53930 = ~I'm innocent, Viconia. I swear it.~
@53931 = ~Did you come here to taunt me or are you going to help me out of here?~
@53932 = ~You say this to me? You who plunged a knife into a young girl's body until her struggles stopped and her blood slicked your skin?~ [BD53932]
@53933 = ~You may claim your innocence, but... none of us are innocent. Least of all you.~ [BD53933]
@53934 = ~Did you come here to taunt me or are you going to help me out of here?~
@53935 = ~I can't bear to have you think this of me, Viconia.~
@53936 = ~If that's the way you feel, then go.~
@53937 = ~Alas, I cannot. I would like to help you, murderer or no. You saved me in the past, and I would return the favor.~ [BD53937]
@53938 = ~But if I were caught, I would be executed without a thought by the brutes who run this city. My life is perilous enough. I cannot tie it to the life of a murderous Bhaalspawn.~ [BD53938]
@53939 = ~You can't leave me like this. I'm innocent, I tell you! I'm INNOCENT!~
@53940 = ~Then this is goodbye.~
@53941 = ~I can't bear to have you think this of me, Viconia.~
@53942 = ~Farewell, <CHARNAME>. I could have called you friend. Perhaps one day our paths will cross again.~ [BD53942]
@53943 = ~But you WILL bear it. Alone in your cell until your last day, you will bear it. You will have no choice.~ [BD53943]
@53944 = ~Now farewell, <CHARNAME>. I could have called you friend. Perhaps one day our paths will cross again.~ [BD53944]
@53945 = ~In all the excitement, I did not have time to properly introduce myself and get to know you. And I would like to get to know you, ja?~ [BD53945]
@53946 = ~It's true we don't know much about each other yet. ~
@53947 = ~If what Jaheira said about you is true, I don't think I want to get to know you.~
@53948 = ~People who get to know me tend to die. You might not want to get too close.~
@53949 = ~But we can! Voghiln will offer you a mighty drink and tell you tales of the North, ja? You will listen while the firelight shines on your beautiful face.~ [BD53949]
@53950 = ~It's a little early for compliments, skald.~
@53951 = ~No drinking. I need to keep my wits about me.~
@53952 = ~I like the sound of a drink, but I'll be the one telling the stories.~
@53953 = ~The lovely and voluptuous Jaheira! She is a feisty woman, ja? Just how Voghiln likes them! As long as they are not too feisty.~ [BD53953]
@53954 = ~You seem to have just the right amount of feist! Voghiln will offer you a mighty drink and tell you tales of the North, ja? You will listen while the firelight shines on your beautiful face.~ [BD53954]
@53955 = ~It's a little early for compliments, skald.~
@53956 = ~No drinking. I need to keep my wits about me.~
@53957 = ~I like the sound of a drink, but I'll be the one telling the stories.~
@53958 = ~Pah! You try to scare Voghiln off, but the womans, they always warn me away. The reasons I have heard! And none of them deter Voghiln, not even for a moment!~ [BD53958]
@53959 = ~When we make camp tonight, Voghiln will offer you a mighty drink and tell you tales of the North, ja? You will listen while the firelight shines on your beautiful face.~ [BD53959]
@53960 = ~It's a little early for compliments, skald.~
@53961 = ~No drinking. I need to keep my wits about me.~
@53962 = ~I like the sound of a drink, but I'll be the one telling the stories.~
@53963 = ~You do not think you have a beautiful face? How about your eyes? Your eyes shine like Selûne's Tears! Never have I seen such sparkle in a woman's eyes.~ [BD53963]
@53964 = ~My face is fine. My eyes are fine. Your compliments are getting on my nerves.~
@53965 = ~That's very... sweet. Now can we continue on?~
@53966 = ~If you don't stop talking, I'll be forced to hurt you.~
@53967 = ~Your hair! Womens love it when you talk about their hair, ja? It is as soft as silk and probably smells divine, if Voghiln could just get in a little closer...~ [BD53967]
@53968 = ~Get away from me!~
@53969 = ~You're persistent, I'll give you that much. Now is not the time though, lusty Luskan.~
@53970 = ~If you don't stop talking, I'll be forced to hurt you.~
@53971 = ~NO DRINKING? Ahem, Voghiln means... means... NO DRINKING?~ [BD53971]
@53972 = ~I see there are many differences between us. No matter! Love conquers all, ja?~ [BD53972]
@53973 = ~Love? We just met!~
@53974 = ~So the bards say. Now we need to keep moving.~
@53975 = ~If you don't stop talking, I'll be forced to hurt you.~
@53976 = ~Does the wolf wait for an appropriate courtship period before he pursues his mate?~ [BD53976]
@53977 = ~To be honest, I don't know. Maybe some wolves do?~
@53978 = ~I'm not your she-wolf.~
@53979 = ~You're confusing me.~
@53980 = ~Ho ho, perhaps that was my plan all along!~ [BD53980]
@53981 = ~Ho ho, I like this plan better! It leaves mine mouth free for drinking! And then later, my lips will be free to kiss your beautiful face.~ [BD53981]
@53982 = ~Whoa there. Slow down.~
@53983 = ~That's not going to happen. Not. Ever.~
@53984 = ~If you don't stop talking, I'll be forced to hurt you.~
@53985 = ~Press on then! We march ahead to camp, and ale, and wine, and song, and VICTORY!~ [BD53985]
@53986 = ~A beautiful day such as this almost makes me forget my longing for the cold beauty of home. The glaciers were sheets of white fire in the sun, almost as icy and lovely as yourself.~ [BD53986]
@53987 = ~Voghiln. We've been over this. I'm not interested in you that way.~
@53988 = ~Now if only I could slowly crush you to death the way a glacier would.~
@53989 = ~I'll take that as a compliment.~
@53990 = ~Oh, but I could pay you MUCH better compliments if you give me the chance, lady! Ho ho!~ [BD53990]
@53991 = ~Ho ho! If Voghiln had a silver piece for every time he heard THAT!~ [BD53991]
@53992 = ~Your skin is soft and delicate as the petal of a rose! Your wit is clear and sparkling as the bubbly wine they drink in Cormyr!~ [BD53992]
@53993 = ~Enough, Voghiln. You don't have to drown me in compliments, as accurate as they are.~
@53994 = ~I could get used to having you around, skald.~
@53995 = ~I appreciate your interest, but it's just not going to happen. We make better friends than lovers.~
@53996 = ~How do you know until we try?~ [BD53996]
@53997 = ~Your arms are as muscular as a hill giant's! You could pick me up and swing me into the treetops without breaking a sweat!~ [BD53997]
@53998 = ~Ho, ho, Voghiln only teases. Mostly. You push me away because there is someone else, ja? Another has captured your heart.~ [BD53998]
@53999 = ~Yes. It's Neera.~
@54000 = ~I have to admit, Dorn is constantly in my thoughts.~
@54001 = ~Corwin is a beautiful woman. I think of her often.~
@54002 = ~Rasaad and I get along well. Our friendship might yet become something more.~
@54003 = ~Yes. Glint has been pursuing my affections.~
@54004 = ~You're starting to grow on me, skald. ~
@54005 = ~I consider my mission more important than romantic entanglements. I have no lover, nor do I care to take one.~
@54006 = ~Ach, it is mine joy to drown you in compliments! Well, not drown, perhaps. Only smother a little. But tell me, is there someone else? Do you resist Voghiln because another nestles in your heart?~ [BD54006]
@54007 = ~Ho, ho! So that is the way it is. Voghiln loves the womans, but when another is on the scene, he understands. I raise my cup to you and wish you all the happiness.~ [BD54007]
@54008 = ~You say that with your mouth, ja, but your eyes...! Eh, to tell the truth, your eyes also say that. Still! Voghiln is not much deterred. Though you do not wish a lover, Voghiln can be a friend!~ [BD54008]
@54009 = ~Ho, ho! Voghiln knows it to be true. I may be loud, I know this, ja. But my heart is true, and I say with all honesty that your company is more intoxicating than my cups.~ [BD54009]
@54010 = ~That's a high compliment indeed, coming from you. Thank you.~
@54011 = ~Your company isn't so bad either. We'll share a drink at the camp tonight.~
@54012 = ~You've yet to see me at my best. I'm glad you're sticking around.~
@54013 = ~We march on, then!~ [BD54013]
@54014 = ~Pfaugh! 'Tis so dark and creepy here. I need a swig of good strong firewine to keep mine blood moving!~ [BD54014]
@54015 = ~I could use some of that myself.~
@54016 = ~No jokes about other ways to keep your blood moving? I'm impressed by your restraint.~
@54017 = ~We don't have time to stop. Keep pressing on.~
@54018 = ~Would that I had a flask on me! I would share it with you, fifty-fifty! Well, sixty-forty at least, ja?~ [BD54018]
@54019 = ~Seventy-thirty?~
@54020 = ~You're a generous spirit, Voghiln. If I had a flask of firewine, I'd keep it entirely to myself.~
@54021 = ~Instead of discussing what we'd do with imaginary firewine, we should keep moving.~
@54022 = ~Ho, ho! You're right, <CHARNAME>! Voghiln missed that opportunity. His wits are as slow as honey on a snowbank!~ [BD54022]
@54023 = ~Do you often put honey on snowbanks up north? That's where you're from, isn't it?~
@54024 = ~You talk about the snow a lot. Do you miss it?~
@54025 = ~You snooze, you loose. Let's keep moving.~
@54026 = ~Ho, ho, your cleverness puts me to shame. Mine wits are as slow as honey on a snowbank!~ [BD54026]
@54027 = ~Ja, we do! It hardens the honey into candy! Ah, I have not had honey-candy in many years. I remember the taste well, though. The taste of home.~ [BD54027]
@54028 = ~You must miss it.~
@54029 = ~We've all come a long way from our homes.~
@54030 = ~Interesting. We'd better keep moving.~
@54031 = ~The North never leaves a Northman. I remember still the chill of the wind darting under mine cloak, icicles hanging in mine beard...~ [BD54031]
@54032 = ~But also the majesty of those rolling, snow-covered plains, like the back of some great white beast. At night, the dancing lights came out and streaked the sky with green and pink. A fine show, one you'd pay a toal to see in Waterdeep!~ [BD54032]
@54033 = ~You paint such a vivid picture. I almost feel like I'm there. ~
@54034 = ~Ho, ho! Voghiln is not just a skald in name, but one in deed!~ [BD54034]
@54035 = ~Ja. Home always calls to lonely hearts. We wander so far from the places where we grew up and leave our small selves behind. Always, though, we hear the song of home.~ [BD54035]
@54036 = ~You have a gift with words, Voghiln.~
@54037 = ~We'd better keep moving.~
@54038 = ~Before we go on... I may not have firewine, but I do have this skin of mead. Shall we toast to continued good fortune and camaraderie?~ [BD54038]
@54039 = ~As long as it's just a sip. I don't want you getting drunk.~
@54040 = ~I see no harm in a quick toast.~
@54041 = ~I'd rather focus on the task at hand. ~
@54042 = ~To our team, then! To you and I! I drink to you and my admiration for you overwhelms! May I kiss your hand?~ [BD54042]
@54043 = ~You may.~
@54044 = ~For a start.~
@54045 = ~No, not my hand nor anything else. We should keep moving.~
@54046 = ~I swoon with happiness! You see the value in our partnership, ja? May I be so bold as to kiss your wrist?~ [BD54046]
@54047 = ~Go ahead.~
@54048 = ~Why draw things out? I know what you really want.~
@54049 = ~No, that's enough. We should keep moving.~
@54050 = ~Long have I dreamed of this moment! Now I come closer... now I kiss...~ [BD54050]
@54051 = ~Kiss me, skald.~
@54052 = ~It's about time.~
@54053 = ~Stop, Voghiln. That's enough. We need to keep moving.~
@54054 = ~Sharess smiles upon me!~ [BD54054]
@54055 = ~You have left me dizzy. Or is it the mead? Either way, we must press on!~ [BD54055]
@54056 = ~If the gods are willing, there will be time for this later! Onward!~ [BD54056]
@54057 = ~Time runs out on us. The enemy of all mortals, ja? We near the end of our tale.~ [BD54057]
@54058 = ~If we're lucky, this will all be over soon.~
@54059 = ~It's hard to say. With such a fine pair as us, the crusaders don't stand a chance though, right?~
@54060 = ~Time does run out on us. We need to push on.~
@54061 = ~Ho, ho! You speak the truth! Caelar's crusaders will be no match for us, ja?~ [BD54061]
@54062 = ~I don't like to be too confident, but we've taken out every other challenge in our path. I don't think Caelar will be able to stop us.~
@54063 = ~Ja... I mean, yeah! We'll stop this ill-fated crusade or die trying.~
@54064 = ~They might easily slay us if we let our guard down. Keep focused and push on.~
@54065 = ~Onward, then! But first, perhaps... 'Tis an old northern superstition that a kiss before battle from a beautiful woman ensures victory.~ [BD54065]
@54066 = ~How convenient for you. And for me. Come here.~
@54067 = ~Does it count if I kiss my own hand?~
@54068 = ~We really don't have time for this.~
@54069 = ~You tease me mercilessly! I admit, I deserve it. But it is not good to ignore superstitions, ja?~ [BD54069]
@54070 = ~One kiss. ~
@54071 = ~We really don't have time for this.~
@54072 = ~One kiss is enough to take the mighty Voghiln's breath away...~ [BD54072]
@54073 = ~And still time slips away! Though we must hurry, I would still ask for one more moment of your time. Something weighs on Voghiln's mind.~ [BD54073]
@54074 = ~What is it?~
@54075 = ~I can spare a few more minutes for you, friend.~
@54076 = ~If you must speak, hurry.~
@54077 = ~Ah... Voghiln the Mighty does not often have to have this conversation. A woman does not usually return mine affection, let alone two.~ [BD54077]
@54078 = ~Two? TWO?~
@54079 = ~What are you saying?~
@54080 = ~I don't like where this is going.~
@54081 = ~There was wine, though, and a moment of weakness. And she was so VERY beautiful by the firelight in the siege camp.~ [BD54081]
@54082 = ~You've been seeing another woman since we were back at the camp?~
@54083 = ~A name. I want a name.~
@54084 = ~Don't worry, Voghiln. I never considered us to be serious. You're not going to break my heart.~
@54085 = ~It was only that one night! And perhaps another, but there was much wine, so Voghiln has trouble remembering! Safana is hard to resist when one's head is clouded.~ [BD54085]
@54086 = ~You were plenty clear-headed, skald. You chased me for days with your tongue hanging out. I finally decided to have a little fun.~ [BD54086]
@54087 = ~But do not be upset! Voghiln has something good to say!~ [BD54087]
@54088 = ~I don't think I want to hear it. You acted like I was the only woman in the world and all the while you were wooing Safana? ~
@54089 = ~I have a few words I want to say too. About the moral character of a certain fickle skald and his hussy.~
@54090 = ~I'm not upset. We were never serious, Voghiln. This was just for fun. If you like Safana better, that's fine with me.~
@54091 = ~Don't feel bad. We all get played once in a while.~ [BD54091]
@54092 = ~Hussy? Hussy... I kinda like that.~ [BD54092]
@54093 = ~Shame, ja! I, I am ashamed. But I have thought much on this, and I must make a choice, ja? And I know now that you, <CHARNAME>, are the lady of mine heart.~ [BD54093]
@54094 = ~You are much less... demanding... than Safana. And your kisses leave Voghiln weak in the knees while Safana's leave mine jaw sore.~ [BD54094]
@54095 = ~Ingrate! Don't come crawling over to my bedroll in the middle of the night when you realize the mistake you're making.~ [BD54095]
@54096 = ~I have burned all mine britches, ja? I understand. But I apologize, truly I do. Voghiln never meant harm to you.~ [BD54096]
@54097 = ~You're a cad, Voghiln. A liar and a womanizer. You can stay in the group, but don't speak to me again unless it's about the mission.~
@54098 = ~I'll keep you with me until we're out of these caverns. After that, I never want to see your face again.~
@54099 = ~What you meant is irrelevant—you hurt me. I'm not saying I'll never trust you again. Work hard and maybe you can make this up to me. MAYBE.~
@54100 = ~I mean it when I say I never loved you. Nor did I expect to. You're fun, and I like the way we work together, but it won't last.~
@54101 = ~Really?~ [BD54101]
@54102 = ~Perhaps. I don't forgive easily, not for something like this. You're going to have to work to make it up to me.~
@54103 = ~No, not really! You're a cad, and I never want to hear your lying tongue again unless it's about the mission.~
@54104 = ~Oh, happy day! Voghiln has a chance, a slim chance, but a chance nonetheless. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I won't let you down again.~ [BD54104]
@54105 = ~I understand. Voghiln the Wilted focuses on the mission.~ [BD54105]
@54106 = ~Wait! Voghiln has more to say on the subject!~ [BD54106]
@54107 = ~Relief overwhelms me. No proclamations of love, no lifelong commitment. Two friends, side by side! And if it becomes something more... who can say? Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I won't let you down again.~ [BD54107]
@54108 = ~Here we stand at the gate to Hell! All nine of them! For all my failings, I never dreamed I would end up here.~ [BD54108]
@54109 = ~Whatever lies beyond this portal, we'll handle it. We've come this far, haven't we?~
@54110 = ~Look at it this way, you'll have some incredible material for a poem if we make it out of this alive.~
@54111 = ~I suspected this might be my eventual fate. But not so soon.~
@54112 = ~Ho, ho! You speak with wisdom, <CHARNAME>. Together, we will carry on, ja?~ [BD54112]
@54113 = ~This will not be your fate, no! Not yet, not ever! I see the strength within you, and you will prevail!~ [BD54113]
@54114 = ~I have been thinking much since our last conversation. It is an activity Voghiln is unused to doing at such great lengths. I want to tell you how many thanks I give you for your kind words.~ [BD54114]
@54115 = ~I only spoke the truth that was in my heart. I like you, and I don't think you meant to hurt me.~
@54116 = ~Caring about someone and being close to them doesn't mean we have to commit to lifelong true love at the outset. I'm happy to enjoy your company and see where life takes us.~
@54117 = ~I gave you one more chance, but only one more. Don't screw things up.~
@54118 = ~Put it from your thoughts, Voghiln. We need to concentrate on our current predicament.~
@54119 = ~Ja, of course. I only wish to tell you that you mean a lot to me. For all Voghiln's bluster, he is not always so fortunate with the womans. Most see me as the one to tell jokes with and drink with, but not one to care about.~ [BD54119]
@54120 = ~That is how it is, ja! I meant no harm. For all Voghiln's bluster, he is not always so fortunate with the womans. It is easy for a pretty lady to turn his head.~ [BD54120]
@54121 = ~You are as sensible as you are beautiful! For all Voghiln's bluster, he is not always so fortunate with the womans. I do not always know the right thing to do or say.~ [BD54121]
@54122 = ~There was a woman once, that Voghiln could have loved. A skald's heart is not easily won! But she could have, had she not been lost in battle.~ [BD54122]
@54123 = ~I'm sorry.~
@54124 = ~We've both lost too many friends.~
@54125 = ~This really isn't the time for confidences.~
@54126 = ~Ja... time rushes on like a river and we cannot move against the current. I am glad I washed up on your shores, fair one! You are much like me—you cannot always show who you truly are.~ [BD54126]
@54127 = ~There is too much danger and too many eyes on you for that. But a skald's eyes see the soul, and yours is strong. Come, a kiss for luck before we venture into this fiendish portal!~ [BD54127]
@54128 = ~For luck.~
@54129 = ~I need to keep a clear head, Voghiln. We should... well... maybe ONE kiss.~
@54130 = ~Not now, skald. We have to finish our mission first.~
@54131 = ~Ho, ho! Let us march forward now! To Hell and back!~ [BD54131]
@54132 = ~Though we have faced many hard times together, this may be the hardest, ja?~ [BD54132]
@54133 = ~The hardest for me, or for you? You look defeated.~
@54134 = ~Voghiln, I didn't murder that girl. I swear it.~
@54135 = ~No, I'd say Hell was the hardest. This is difficult, but I'll get through it.~
@54136 = ~I am... sad, mine friend. I have always been ready with a joke or a song to lift the spirits, but now... Voghiln the Mighty is empty.~ [BD54136]
@54137 = ~Ever pragmatic, ja? You look at your situation with such clear eyes. But Voghiln the Mighty is saddened at the sight of you.~ [BD54137]
@54138 = ~I must know, <CHARNAME>. The evidence seems so obvious, but... did you murder Skie?~ [BD54138]
@54139 = ~No. I didn't.~
@54140 = ~Does it matter what I say? As you pointed out, the evidence seems obvious.~
@54141 = ~If I said yes, would you believe me?~
@54142 = ~Your words lift a weight off Voghiln's heart. I did not wish to believe it of you.~ [BD54142]
@54143 = ~Can you get me out of here, then?~
@54144 = ~Then rest easy, because I'm innocent. I'm still locked up, though.~
@54145 = ~Your relief and two gold will buy me a glass of wine. What I need is to get out of here.~
@54146 = ~Alas, I am only a skald. A mighty skald, to be sure, but all mine honeyed words cannot turn the ear of Duke Silvershield.~ [BD54146]
@54147 = ~I saw with mine own eyes the girl's bloodied body, ja? And the dagger was in your hand as you stood over her corpse.~ [BD54147]
@54148 = ~Could you do such a thing? Voghiln does not wish to believe it. Yet there are some who say evil and chaos will always live in a Bhaalspawn's heart.~ [BD54148]
@54149 = ~Then there's nothing more for us to say.~
@54150 = ~But I AM innocent, Voghiln. I swear it.~
@54151 = ~If you can't help me, leave. I don't need you standing there feeling sorry for yourself while I rot in this cell.~
@54152 = ~Worse, mine efforts to free you have cast suspicion on Voghiln himself! There are whispers that I may have aided you, that our closeness has blinded me to your true nature.~ [BD54152]
@54153 = ~Then... You've got to get out of here, Voghiln. Flee, before you wind up in the cell next to me.~
@54154 = ~Don't be a coward, Voghiln. Stay here and fight for me!~
@54155 = ~I'm not surprised. Those gossips at court must be having a time with this news.~
@54156 = ~I must leave. I cannot help you if I too am imprisoned. But never doubt, lady, that you will remain in mine thoughts. Forever.~ [BD54156]
@54157 = ~I fear I must go. Suspicion has been cast on me as well. There are whispers that I may have aided you, that our closeness has blinded me to your true nature.~ [BD54157]
@54158 = ~I must leave now, but never doubt that you will remain in mine thoughts. You have left your mark on Voghiln's life, ja? Forever.~ [BD54158]
@54159 = ~It is good to be out of that accursed cage. I've a knot in my back I'll feel for weeks. ~
@54160 = ~What were you thinking, attacking all those people?~
@54161 = ~A back rub would do wonders for you.~
@54162 = ~I've no time for whining.~
@54163 = ~I attacked a single person. Regrettably, I was made to attack him while he addressed near everyone in the camp. ~
@54164 = ~What do you mean you were "made to" attack him?~
@54165 = ~Why did you attack anyone?~
@54166 = ~I've no time for whining.~
@54167 = ~I am not some child to be coddled. ~
@54168 = ~Forget I said anything. Why don't you tell me why you attacked all those people?~
@54169 = ~That's not what I meant.~
@54170 = ~Don't take that tone with me. Remember which of us was caged up like a dog.~
@54171 = ~I'll let that pass. Count yourself lucky you freed me, <CHARNAME>. I would not be so lenient with another. ~
@54172 = ~My words were careless. Tell me, why did you attack all those people?~
@54173 = ~You seem awfully tense, Dorn. Perhaps you could use a backrub?~
@54174 = ~Attack me and you'll be back in that cage before you can blink. Enough talk. Let's get moving.~
@54175 = ~I was tasked with eliminating Hormorn, a priest of Caelar, as he performed the crusade's so-called ritual of Enlightenment, I was not told the ritual involved nearly every crusader in a ten-mile radius. ~
@54176 = ~Then why did you do it?~
@54177 = ~Not the easiest task in the world. But you tried anyway?~
@54178 = ~Enough of your inane chatter. We need to move on.~
@54179 = ~Then what did you mean? ~
@54180 = ~I trust you'll figure it out, in time.~
@54181 = ~You. And I. Together. Alone. Massage.~
@54182 = ~It matters not. Why did you attack the crusade?~
@54183 = ~I must do as my patron, Ur-Gothoz, bids, regardless of my feelings on the matter. My covenant with him requires my obedience. In exchange, he grants me my dark power. ~
@54184 = ~What is that power worth if it means you can be forced to charge into an unwinnable battle?~
@54185 = ~And if you don't obey?~
@54186 = ~Then you are naught but a slave. I thought better of you, Dorn.~
@54187 = ~You have no idea. I was a power to be reckoned with before my arrangement with Ur-Gothoz. Now my strength, my power, is unequaled.~
@54188 = ~And what would happen if you don't obey?~
@54189 = ~But you are naught but a slave. I thought better of you, Dorn.~
@54190 = ~This is true. You are an incredible force on the battlefield. ~
@54191 = ~At best, Ur-Gothoz would cut me off from his power. He would, in all likelihood, kill me for my insolence. ~
@54192 = ~In the meantime, though, you have strength and courage the likes of which I have never seen.~
@54193 = ~But you are naught but a slave. I thought better of you, Dorn.~
@54194 = ~We all have a price to pay for our abilities, I suppose. Come. We should move on.~
@54195 = ~I did what was necessary. You would be wise not to underestimate what I have gained by chaining myself to Ur-Gothoz.~
@54196 = ~I'm glad you noticed.~
@54197 = ~Lead on and I will follow you into battle. Take care to bring me to your enemies soon, that I may slate my bloodlust.~
@54198 = ~This is neither the time nor the place. Later, perhaps.~
@54199 = ~This is pointless. We would be much faster and more effective in smaller groups. ~
@54200 = ~Thank you for your expert opinion, Dorn. Clearly you've seen many a siege.~
@54201 = ~Perhaps, but this is the way we're doing things.~
@54202 = ~Agreed. When the time comes, we'll be leaving these fools in the dust and doing things properly.~
@54203 = ~I know an idiotic idea when I see one, <CHARNAME>.~
@54204 = ~The safe option is rarely the most effective one.~
@54205 = ~Just because something is safe doesn't mean it's ill-advised.~
@54206 = ~And what would you suggest, exactly? A frontal assault from a tiny band of adventurers, against an entire army?~
@54207 = ~But it IS the safe one.~
@54208 = ~Good. I am glad to see you still have a head on your shoulders.~
@54209 = ~The best course of action would be to abandon this foolishness and let the peasants squabble amongst themselves. Clearly, however, you have made up your mind to see this through.~
@54210 = ~There are—occasionally—times I envy your freedom, <CHARNAME>. ~
@54211 = ~Why do you say that?~
@54212 = ~What freedom?~
@54213 = ~Yes, I can imagine.~
@54214 = ~You fight for your own banner. You choose your targets, your causes, your campaigns. ~
@54215 = ~And you serve at the whim of Ur-Gothoz.~
@54216 = ~I'm not as free as you might think.~
@54217 = ~Do you think I'm choosing well?~
@54218 = ~In a sense, yes. In another sense, I have chosen to serve. It was my decision to tether myself to my master.~
@54219 = ~Was it really, though? Or were you powerless to make another choice?~
@54220 = ~I understand. I am also not as free as you might think.~
@54221 = ~And what of my decisions? Do you think I'm choosing well?~
@54222 = ~We should move on.~
@54223 = ~No? Explain. ~
@54224 = ~You think I choose what I do? No. It has always been decided by others, one way or another. In many ways, I am as powerless as you.~
@54225 = ~I may be free to choose my path, but I require allies to walk it. I have asked you to fight with me because I need you.~
@54226 = ~I make the decisions I want, but I must ultimately answer to those who follow me. Do you think I'm choosing well?~
@54227 = ~At least you have the sense to recognize a valuable ally when you see one.~
@54228 = ~If you have any hesitation about the decisions you make, step down as leader. You have no business issuing orders if you don't know what you're doing.~
@54229 = ~That sounded more harsh than I intended. I have followed incompetent leaders in the past and it led to messy endings. I do not wish to see that happen here.~
@54230 = ~Nor do I.~
@54231 = ~Watch your mouth, blackguard. I have no desire to be chastised by one of my lessers.~
@54232 = ~Forget it. Let's move on.~
@54233 = ~I am far from powerless. But power is not freedom.~
@54234 = ~This talk of freedom and choices raises a question in my mind. Is there one among our group you consider a potential mate? I wish to know where your loyalties lie.~
@54235 = ~Yes. It's Neera.~
@54236 = ~I have to admit, Safana is constantly in my thoughts.~
@54237 = ~Corwin is a beautiful woman. I think of her often.~
@54238 = ~Rasaad and I get along well. Our friendship might yet become something more.~
@54239 = ~Yes. Glint has been pursuing my affections.~
@54240 = ~Viconia fascinates me.~
@54241 = ~I actually find you quite intriguing, Dorn.~
@54242 = ~I consider my mission more important than romantic entanglements. I have no lover, nor do I care to take one.~
@54243 = ~I will watch them closely. Should they lead you astray, they will feel my wrath.~
@54244 = ~A wise course of action. I respect your decision.~
@54245 = ~Don't be a fool. We are at war and I am not some simpering barmaid to be wooed.~
@54246 = ~This is intolerable! ~
@54247 = ~What's wrong?~
@54248 = ~I agree. I hate stalking around these dark caverns.~
@54249 = ~Not now, Dorn.~
@54250 = ~We should be attacking the enemy head on. They should see the faces of those who strike them down. ~
@54251 = ~Trust me. They will. They'll just be a little weaker when we do so.~
@54252 = ~There will be plenty of battle later. PLENTY. I expect to see you covered in gore from tusk to toe.~
@54253 = ~Quiet, Dorn. I've got enough to deal with. ~
@54254 = ~Clearly my opinion is not important. I shall remember that.~
@54255 = ~Hmm. Perhaps the plan does have some merit. In this moment you remind me of someone I once knew.~
@54256 = ~Reminiscing? That's not like you.~
@54257 = ~Who?~
@54258 = ~We don't have time for idle talk. ~
@54259 = ~Reminiscing requires fondness or nostalgia: I indulge in neither. I was simply making an observation.~
@54260 = ~When I was a boy, the Il-Khan tribe was led by a fierce warrior, a <PRO_MANWOMAN> by the name of Arktash.~
@54261 = ~The stories say <PRO_HESHE> too used guile to <PRO_HISHER> advantage.~
@54262 = ~A flattering comparison.~
@54263 = ~You know I prefer direct combat when possible. ~
@54264 = ~Go on. I wish to hear more about this Arktash I resemble so strongly.~
@54265 = ~I idolized <PRO_HIMHER>, for a time. It was clear that <PRO_HESHE> was intelligent and cunning. An impressive leader who did many things for our tribe in <PRO_HISHER> short reign.~
@54266 = ~What happened?~
@54267 = ~Thank you for the comparison, then.~
@54268 = ~Intelligent and cunning, yes. But I am also fierce. My blood runs hot. Can't you feel the warmth from my skin when you stand near me?~
@54269 = ~Arktash connived <PRO_HISHER> way into power; <PRO_HESHE> did not earn <PRO_HISHER> position with blood. Despite the good <PRO_HESHE> did the tribe, <PRO_HISHER> rivals worked to bring <PRO_HIMHER> down.~
@54270 = ~But <PRO_HESHE> was killed less than a season into <PRO_HISHER> reign. It seems <PRO_HESHE> did not respect <PRO_HISHER> enemies enough to face them head on, and suffered the consequences.~
@54271 = ~You can't compare that to what we're doing, Dorn. They're completely different situations.~
@54272 = ~What exactly are you getting at here?~
@54273 = ~I like to stack the odds, yes, but I also have a fighting spirit. Did you mean to insult or warn me with your story? You've inflamed me. I will prove my power to you.~
@54274 = ~What an offensive story. Never speak to me like this again.~
@54275 = ~Do not let your guile turn you soft. There is only so much I can do to protect you on the battlefield. ~
@54276 = ~I see the passion in your eyes, but you must back up your words with action. Time will tell if your story ends like Arktash's or if you forge your own fate.~
@54277 = ~<CHARNAME>... a word? ~
@54278 = ~What is it?~
@54279 = ~If you're brief. We can only rest a moment.~
@54280 = ~"Quiet." Is that a good enough word for you?~
@54281 = ~Your barbed tongue fails to draw blood, but I will hold mine.~
@54282 = ~I have been thinking about the last words we spoke. There is something I wish to add.~
@54283 = ~I'm listening.~
@54284 = ~Is it another tale of an orc warrior who met a horrible death and reminds you of me? Cause then I'll pass.~
@54285 = ~Speak, then.~
@54286 = ~It's possible I did not give you the credit you deserve for leading us thus far. I am not a strategist. I am a warrior. I... admire your ability to think in times of danger. ~
@54287 = ~Thank you. It's kept me alive so far.~
@54288 = ~Was that... was that a compliment? Dorn. I don't know what to say.~
@54289 = ~If you've said your piece, let's move on.~
@54290 = ~The most desirable skills are the ones that keep our hearts beating from minute to minute.~
@54291 = ~Another fine example of your cleverness in times of stress. Be thankful I am in a gaming mood.~
@54292 = ~Power comes in many forms. This I have learned. Your power is more subtle. Mine, that gifted by Ur-Gothoz, is the power of physicality.~
@54293 = ~You certainly have a powerful body.~
@54294 = ~I'll say. Your muscles are impressive.~
@54295 = ~Yes, you are a fine warrior. Can we press on now?~
@54296 = ~And yet you haven't seen everything it can do. I am a warrior, yes, but there are far more pleasurable uses I can put this body to. ~
@54297 = ~I can imagine. In fact I HAVE imagined. Many times...~
@54298 = ~Believe me, I've noticed your form. Now is just not the time. Have no doubt though that you will be in my thoughts.~
@54299 = ~This is not the kind of talk I expected from you, Dorn. Keep your mind on the mission from now on.~
@54300 = ~We must go, I know. But we can have one moment to ourselves.~
@54301 = ~My blood simmers with anticipation. Let us continue on.~
@54302 = ~So be it.~
@54303 = ~Avernus. It was inevitable. The path I walk could only take me to one Hell or another. ~
@54304 = ~The aim is just to visit, not take up permanent residence. ~
@54305 = ~Why do you think you'll end up in Hell?~
@54306 = ~Let's do this.~
@54307 = ~If all goes well, we will return. If not... then permanent residence may be a possibility.~
@54308 = ~The murder of many does not go unseen or unpunished. ~
@54309 = ~At least when I die, I will be provided for. I will while away eternity in the service of Ur-Gothoz, and I will wreak havoc in the Blood War in his name. ~
@54310 = ~That doesn't sound appetizing. ~
@54311 = ~The Blood War?~
@54312 = ~We should stop talking and get this over with.~
@54313 = ~I am assured that it is a great honor.~
@54314 = ~The Blood War is the endless battle between devils and demons. At times, both have had the upper hand, and I've no doubt we will soon meet one of the major powers in the war.~
@54315 = ~If we must go to the Nine Hells to end this, then we will. And we will triumph.~
@54316 = ~It sounds like a fitting fate for you... and perhaps, one day, for me.~
@54317 = ~Then let's get this over with.~
@54318 = ~The fire of the portal reflects the darkness in your heart. You and I are of one kind, <CHARNAME>. ~
@54319 = ~My orcish blood burns within my veins. If we do not take action soon, I will be forced to either kill something or throw you down before me.~
@54320 = ~Then let us venture through this portal and I will watch you slaughter legions of fiends on the other side. ~
@54321 = ~I think you know which of those two options I'd prefer.~
@54322 = ~Enough talk. Let's get this over with.~
@54323 = ~As we lack in both time and privacy, I will satisfy myself with but a taste of you before tearing our enemies to pieces.~
@54324 = ~Yes! First, I shall satisfy myself with a taste of you, and then we will bring Hell's legions to their knees!~
@54325 = ~Through the portal! Into the flames!~
@54326 = ~<CHARNAME>. ~
@54327 = ~Dorn. ~
@54328 = ~I freed you once. It's time you returned the favor.~
@54329 = ~What are you doing here?~
@54330 = ~I've nothing to say to you.~
@54331 = ~The chains suit you. ~
@54332 = ~And the bars?~
@54333 = ~You don't look so bad yourself.~
@54334 = ~How can you be so casual? I'm in prison!~
@54335 = ~I came to express my admiration.~
@54336 = ~Your loss. Enjoy your sentence, Bhaalspawn.~
@54337 = ~I can hardly believe you had it in you. Yet again, Bhaalspawn, you impress me. You are more worthy than I'd imagined.~
@54338 = ~I've a confession. I didn't actually murder the girl, though given half the chance I would have.~
@54339 = ~I was framed, Dorn. I did not murder Skie.~
@54340 = ~I'm featured in your imagination, am I?~
@54341 = ~She was a mewling nuisance. I am glad to be rid of her.~
@54342 = ~The bars do not suit you quite so well.~
@54343 = ~That is disappointing, if it is true. Though it would explain your carelessness.~
@54344 = ~Though I approve of the murder, I cannot condone your sloppiness. Killing her so openly, splashing her blood around until you dripped with it... attractive, but sloppy.~
@54345 = ~That's because I didn't actually kill her.~
@54346 = ~You don't mind that I'm a murderer? You just don't like my technique?~
@54347 = ~I'm sorry my murder doesn't meet your high standards.~
@54348 = ~That is beside the point. The fact is you are caged, now, and I am not. ~
@54349 = ~Then release me, as I did you.~
@54350 = ~You could change that easily enough.~
@54351 = ~If you're not going to get me out of this cell, begone.~
@54352 = ~Even I could not escape such confinement. The effort they have expended to ensure your imprisonment is... formidable.~
@54353 = ~My presence here is tolerated at best. With you jailed for murder, I must make a quick exit lest the fine officers here find some excuse to hang me.~
@54354 = ~You're just going to leave me here?~
@54355 = ~I understand. At least one of us can be safe.~
@54356 = ~If you're not going to release me, get out of here. ~
@54357 = ~I wish it could be otherwise. The sight of you with Skie's blood plastering your shirt to your chest was... exciting.~
@54358 = ~If it were not for these unbending bars, I would show you how much I still desire you. But instead, I must leave. I hope you find freedom again.~
@54359 = ~Is there something I can do for you, <CHARNAME>?~ [BD54359]
@54360 = ~Why do you ask?~
@54361 = ~I'm trying to think of a way to answer that doesn't end with me getting slapped. And failing miserably. Well, perhaps not miserably—some things are worth a slap.~
@54362 = ~You've done more than enough for me already, and I thank you for it.~
@54363 = ~Nothing I can't do better for myself.~
@54364 = ~Look around you, <CHARNAME>. Are you in a tavern? A whorehouse? No? Then grow up. We have work to do—YOU have work to do. Stop playing the fool and do it.~ [BD54364]
@54365 = ~I simply thought that if we're to travel together, face Caelar Argent together, we might do well to get to know one another.~ [BD54365]
@54366 = ~I would like nothing better, Captain. But I fear you'll not find me good company at the moment.~
@54367 = ~I suspect you'll know all of me you want to and more before our business with the Shining Lady is at an end.~
@54368 = ~Agreed. Let's go find some place private and get to... knowing each other.~
@54369 = ~I mean no offense, but I think I'd prefer this relationship remain professional.~
@54370 = ~You barely know me. ~
@54371 = ~I'd like to change that.~
@54372 = ~I know enough to know I'd like to know more.~
@54373 = ~I'm an excellent judge of character.~
@54374 = ~Certainly not in the way I'd like to know you.~
@54375 = ~If you truly believe that, then let it remain so.~
@54376 = ~Fair enough. Let's go.~
@54377 = ~Agreed. Let's go.~
@54378 = ~Let's concentrate on the mission, then. If we can do what the Grand Dukes have asked, I'll be satisfied.~ [BD54378]
@54379 = ~If that is all you want of me, then it shall be done. And if you should ever want something more... you will let me know, yes?~
@54380 = ~Would that everyone were so easy to satisfy.~
@54381 = ~Is that really all you want? I think there's more to you than duty. Tell me, what is it you're feeling. What do you desire?~
@54382 = ~Your and the Council's satisfaction means little to me. I've my own reasons to seek Caelar Argent and put a stop to her.~
@54383 = ~You think it'll be easy? I admire your optimism, if nothing else. Let's go.~ [BD54383]
@54384 = ~This isn't the time. I have a mission. That's all that matters. So let's go.~ [BD54384]
@54385 = ~Can I have a word, <CHARNAME>? ~
@54386 = ~Of course, Corwin. It's always a pleasure to speak with you.~
@54387 = ~That depends on the word you want to have. If "idiot" is one of them, find another to talk to.~
@54388 = ~You can have three, Corwin: Leave me alone.~
@54389 = ~I've little desire to discuss anything with you beyond Caelar and her mad crusade.~
@54390 = ~Would that it were so. I owe you an apology. ~
@54391 = ~You owe me nothing, Corwin.~
@54392 = ~I couldn't agree more.~
@54393 = ~Let that debt go unpaid. I don't want to hear it.~
@54394 = ~I suppose I deserve that. Very well. If this is how it's to be between us, then this is how it shall be.~
@54395 = ~I've been thinking about what will happen when we reach Dragonspear. I've never served in a coalition before. Alliances bring strength, so long as everyone can get along.~ [BD54395]
@54396 = ~Three armies working together... it won't be easy on the soldiers. Or anyone.~
@54397 = ~It's a good thing you have me as an ally, then. That's at least one person you can count on to be on your side.~
@54398 = ~I don't want you to be sorry. I want you to be happy. Lighten up, for gods' sake.~
@54399 = ~I don't have time to anticipate future problems. I have enough present ones. Let's concentrate on the mission instead of small talk.~
@54400 = ~Not through your eye. Maybe a leg.~
@54401 = ~This life isn't easy for anyone, I know. It was easier, once, when all I had to worry about was myself. A child changes things. I have responsibilities. To Rohma, to my father... to the Fist, of course.~ [BD54401]
@54402 = ~I've let other people into my life since Rohma was born. They... I don't want to talk about them. My father says you only need one to win the game, but I'm tired of playing games.~ [BD54402]
@54403 = ~Let's not play them, then. I am attracted to you, Corw—Schael. What comes of that is up to you. If nothing comes of it at all, I've no regrets having said what I've said.~
@54404 = ~Life is a game.~
@54405 = ~You need to find the right person to play with. Take me, for instance.~
@54406 = ~Then let us end this one before it begins. I'm not interested in you, Corwin. Not like that. Let's keep our relationship professional.~
@54407 = ~Aye. That would be for the best, I think.~ [BD54407]
@54408 = ~I appreciate your being so... forthright. I won't deny I'm drawn to you. But after what happened in my last relationship, with Tianna... Give me some time to consider this. Please.~ [BD54408]
@54409 = ~For you, perhaps. Some of us can't afford to take everything so lightly. Too much depends on us. Ah, well, I'm rambling now. Let's keep moving.~ [BD54409]
@54410 = ~I don't want to talk about this anymore. Let's go.~
@54411 = ~It's all a big joke for you, isn't it? I wish I could be so carefree.~
@54412 = ~There are worse things to be than happy.~
@54413 = ~Then be it. There's nothing easier.~
@54414 = ~You could be, if you truly desired it. But you won't, will you? You're happier to play the suffering mother, bemoaning her fate to a cruel world.~
@54415 = ~I was happy once. ~
@54416 = ~Some would say you're lucky to have had that. I am not one of them. I know little of you, Schael, but I am quite certain you deserve a happily ever after.~
@54417 = ~You can be again. I'll show you. You'll see.~
@54418 = ~You cling to misery like moss to a tree. Pathetic.~
@54419 = ~I envy you your optimism, <CHARNAME>. But I can make no promises. Let's go. ~
@54420 = ~Do you have any children, <CHARNAME>?~ [BD54420]
@54421 = ~No. Not yet, anyway. Someday, I hope. If I'm lucky.~
@54422 = ~Not that I'm aware of, and I'm fairly sure I'd have noticed.~
@54423 = ~I hope not.~
@54424 = ~Only a fool would bring a child into a world like this one.~
@54425 = ~Some would see children as a gift. ~
@54426 = ~Indeed. A gift I hope the gods see fit to bestow upon me one day.~
@54427 = ~If children are such a gift, why do you spend time away from Rohma?~
@54428 = ~And some have children like Skie Silvershield.~
@54429 = ~Fools, all of them.~
@54430 = ~I'm a fool, then?~ [BD54430]
@54431 = ~Of course not. Forgive me, Corwin. I spoke without thinking.~
@54432 = ~Foolish, or selfish. I can see no other reason to burden a child with life.~
@54433 = ~Only you can know that with any certainty.~
@54434 = ~You don't really want me to answer that question.~
@54435 = ~Some would see life as a gift. ~
@54436 = ~Generally speaking, they're right to do so. But how great that gift is lies on the shoulders of the parents. Or parent, as the case may be.~
@54437 = ~I imagine thinking so would alleviate the guilt, somewhat.~
@54438 = ~A gift? For Skie Silvershield and those who share her advantages, perhaps. For most it is a squalid , pointless existence.~
@54439 = ~Fools, all of them.~
@54440 = ~I'd hate to see Rohma grow up to be anything like Skie Silvershield. ~
@54441 = ~With you as her mother? I can't see that happening.~
@54442 = ~There are worse things for a child to be than spoiled.~
@54443 = ~Between her living in Baldur's Gate and your duties as an officer of the Flaming Fist, you'll be lucky to see her grow up at all.~
@54444 = ~Unfortunately, children don't remain children. Not if they're lucky.~
@54445 = ~You are in a foul temper this day. I'll leave you to it.~ [BD54445]
@54446 = ~You'd be willing to give up adventure? To turn your back on this life you lead?~
@54447 = ~The life of endless violence, chaos, and bloodshed? I think I could make the sacrifice.~
@54448 = ~You think I'd have to? You have Rohma, yet here you are.~
@54449 = ~I'd be happy enough to turn away from it. Unfortunately, it seems wholly unwilling to do me the same courtesy.~
@54450 = ~It's not adventure I seek. It's wealth. Power. Comfort. When I have secured those things, then I shall rest. And then, perhaps, I shall consider having children. But not before.~
@54451 = ~Thanks for that, <CHARNAME>. I wasn't feeling near guilty enough already this <DAYNIGHTALL>. ~
@54452 = ~You have nothing to feel guilty about, Schael. You are doing what you must to provide for your family.~
@54453 = ~I've seen little of Rohma, Corwin, but what I have seen tells me that when it comes to your daughter, you've little to feel guilty for.~
@54454 = ~Guilty? Why? It's not as though you've unleashed another Skie Silvershield upon the world.~
@54455 = ~You feel only what you allow yourself to feel. Don't blame me for your shortcomings.~
@54456 = ~There's nothing I wouldn't do for Rohma and my father. But the time my duties take me away from them, the risks the job carries with it... Sometimes I wonder if I've made the right decision. Is a full belly worth an absent mother?~ [BD54456]
@54457 = ~A loving mother is a prize beyond measure. I speak from hard experience.~
@54458 = ~You're asking the wrong <PRO_MANWOMAN>. I never knew my mother.~
@54459 = ~A full belly is worth anything to a starving <PRO_MANWOMAN>. You do what you must for your child, Corwin. Don't ever doubt that.~
@54460 = ~You speak to one who had no mother, who knows hunger all too well. Do you truly need to ask that question?~
@54461 = ~I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up a painful subject. It's just hard, with me away so often and Rohma's father not around. Sometimes I think she might have been better off if I'd left her on the steps of the Temple of the Radiant Heart, like her father wanted.~ [BD54461]
@54462 = ~Reprehensible. Rohma's father had better hope he and I never cross paths.~
@54463 = ~She's lucky to have you as a mother. No one could replace you in her life.~
@54464 = ~Too late to find out now.~
@54465 = ~Better she die than be raised by zealots. The last thing this world needs is another Caelar.~
@54466 = ~He was. We both were. ~
@54467 = ~How did we get talking about this? Let's talk about something else—better still, let's just not talk at all for a while, all right?~ [BD54467]
@54468 = ~Speaking without thought is the surest way to speak the truth.~ [BD54468]
@54469 = ~Considering the way he and I ended things, I'd say that's highly unlikely.~ [BD54469]
@54470 = ~I'm going to take that as a joke. It'll be healthier for both of us. But don't make a joke like that ever again.~
@54471 = ~We need to talk, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD54471]
@54472 = ~Whatever you need, Schael. You know that.~
@54473 = ~What's on your mind?~
@54474 = ~Outside of our mission, I believe I'm done talking with you, Captain.~
@54475 = ~No, we don't. We need to focus on what we're doing here. Nothing else matters, certainly not conversation. I'm sure you understand.~
@54476 = ~I see. Perhaps that's for the best. Yes. Let's leave it there, then.~ [BD54476]
@54477 = ~Stop calling me that. Corwin or captain—for now, at least. Please.~
@54478 = ~I'm not happy with the way we—with the way I left things when we were talking about children. Rohma. Damn it, why is this so hard?~ [BD54478]
@54479 = ~The important things are never easy.~
@54480 = ~Said the courtesan to the cleric.~
@54481 = ~Wow. Someone really messed you up, didn't they?~
@54482 = ~It's not something we need to discuss now. Or ever. I think it would be best if we stay friends, and nothing more.~
@54483 = ~Can you try to be serious just for one gods damned minute?~ [BD54483]
@54484 = ~Aye, you're right about that. All right, here it is...~ [BD54484]
@54485 = ~I don't think it's any great secret that I've found myself attracted to you these past few weeks. I'm attracted to a lot of people. Attraction is easy enough to deal with. Feelings are another story.~ [BD54485]
@54486 = ~Some stories have happy endings.~
@54487 = ~Some stories have happy endings.~
@54488 = ~Feelings can be easy too. If it feels good, do it. If it doesn't, stop.~
@54489 = ~Your feelings are your own problem. Deal with them on your own time, and stop wasting mine.~
@54490 = ~The life we lead pushes us to places we may not want to go—not yet. I've made mistakes before—too many mistakes. I'm trying to make better choices, not just for me, but for Rohma.~ [BD54490]
@54491 = ~The last person I shared my bed with... It didn't turn out well with her. Not as bad as with Rohma's father, but not well.~ [BD54491]
@54492 = ~If I'm to do this again, I need it to work. I need to think, not just feel. I can't rush into another doomed relationship. And it felt like that's what I was about to do.~ [BD54492]
@54493 = ~That's why I shut you out when we started talking about children. Because I can't afford to let you in—let anybody in. Not until I know they're the right one.~ [BD54493]
@54494 = ~I understand completely. Take your time. When you decide what you want, I'll be here. You're worth waiting for.~
@54495 = ~I'd like you to be more than a friend, Corwin—but if that's all I'm ever able to call you, I'll count myself blessed. Let's see where this relationship goes together.~
@54496 = ~If you've not decided yet, you never will. Let me make this easy for you. We shall do as the Council wishes and end the threat of Caelar. When that task is finished, so are we.~
@54497 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for understanding.~ [BD54497]
@54498 = ~Friends it is, then. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for understanding. Let's go.~ [BD54498]
@54499 = ~I've been watching you, <CHARNAME>. And of late, I don't like what I see. If we're to be friends and nothing more, so be it. Colleagues and nothing else? Fine.~ [BD54499]
@54500 = ~But you've got to decide what exactly we will be—if anything—and soon, or I'll make the decision for you.~ [BD54500]
@54501 = ~I want more than friendship, Schael. I want you.~
@54502 = ~I'm sorry, but Rasaad and I have grown close. I hope you and I can remain friends.~
@54503 = ~I must admit, I do have feelings for Rasaad—but they're nothing compared to what I feel for you.~
@54504 = ~You would have me choose 'twixt you and Viconia?~
@54505 = ~I must admit, I do have feelings for Viconia—but they're nothing compared to what I feel for you.~
@54506 = ~Don't make me choose between you and Glint. He means much to me.~
@54507 = ~I must admit, I do have feelings for Glint—but they're nothing compared to what I feel for you.~
@54508 = ~You would have me choose between you and Safana? How am I supposed to do that?~
@54509 = ~I must admit, I do have feelings for Safana—but they're nothing compared to what I feel for you.~
@54510 = ~Dorn and I are destined to be together. Our futures are entwined like two serpents, each eating the others' tail.~
@54511 = ~I must admit, I do have feelings for Dorn—but they're nothing compared to what I feel for you.~
@54512 = ~I have treasured our time together, Schael. I truly have. But I would be lying to myself if I told you my feelings for Neera weren't greater than any others I have. Worse, I'd be lying to you.~
@54513 = ~I must admit, I do have feelings for Neera—but they're nothing compared to what I feel for you.~
@54514 = ~I feel like an idiot saying this, but then, only an idiot would: Voghiln is the one my heart desires.~
@54515 = ~I must admit, I do have feelings for Voghiln-but they're nothing compared to what I feel for you.~
@54516 = ~We will be comrades in arms, but nothing more.~
@54517 = ~I never meant to push you away. But if this is what you want, far be it from me to try and stop you. ~
@54518 = ~You give up too easily, Corwin. I see now we could never have worked together as anything but professional colleagues.~
@54519 = ~Huh. I'd hoped you'd put up a bit more of a fight than that.~
@54520 = ~So meek, so submissive. How you rose to the rank of captain, I'll never know.~
@54521 = ~I don't like games, <CHARNAME>. If you do, find someone else to play them with. I've more important matters to attend to.~
@54522 = ~There's lots of things about me you'll never know, <CHARNAME>.~
@54523 = ~So long as we're still that, I'll be fine. We've a job to do. Let's go get it done.~ [BD54523]
@54524 = ~That you can't choose tells me all I need to know. Go, follow your heart. I hope you find happiness.~ [BD54524]
@54525 = ~That's all I needed to hear. Let's go.~ [BD54525]
@54526 = ~That you can't choose tells me all I need to know. Go, be with your drow. I hope you find happiness together.~ [BD54526]
@54527 = ~Baravar's cloak, <CHARNAME>! You know I pride myself on being an open-minded fellow, but there are limits.~
@54528 = ~I know some who've made this sort of thing work, but I've never been one of them. One lover at a time is enough for me. Usually it's too much.~
@54529 = ~Tell me about it.~
@54530 = ~Best for everyone that we keep our relationship strictly professional. Go, be with the gnome. I hope he makes you happy. Truly.~
@54531 = ~Let me do it for you, darling. I like my men a bit more... firm. I'm disappointed in you, but not surprised.~
@54532 = ~Wrong answer, <CHARNAME>. You're welcome to try and make something with the thief. For myself, I'll return my focus to where it should've been to begin with—on ending the crusade and getting home to my daughter.~
@54533 = ~To think I even considered the possibility of you and I being together. Madness. Be with Dorn, then. I want nothing more to do with you.~ [BD54533]
@54534 = ~Better a harsh certainty than a soft doubt. Go, be with the elf.~
@54535 = ~Half-elf.~
@54536 = ~I hope you find happiness together. Truly. For myself, I'll return my focus to where it should've been to begin with—on ending the crusade and getting home to my daughter.~
@54537 = ~Not the answer I wanted, but better to know a harsh truth than live in ignorance. For me, anyway.~
@54538 = ~We're getting close, <CHARNAME>. This will all be over soon.~ [BD54538]
@54539 = ~Then I'll be back to Baldur's Gate and you'll be back to Rohma.~
@54540 = ~One way or another.~
@54541 = ~Don't get careless. We've come a long way, but there's still a long way to go.~
@54542 = ~It'll be over TOO soon if you don't focus.~
@54543 = ~Don't be morbid. We've come too far, endured too much to be thwarted now. ~
@54544 = ~Of all the gifts you've given me, none is more precious than hope. I wouldn't have made it this far without you.~
@54545 = ~I hope you're right, Schael.~
@54546 = ~We can ALWAYS be thwarted. That's why we have to hold on to every moment. You never know when it will all end.~
@54547 = ~Caelar doesn't care what we've been through. Focus, woman! I'll not die, for you or anyone.~
@54548 = ~Come here.~ [BD54548]
@54549 = ~What? Why?~
@54550 = ~You aren't going to slap me, are you?~
@54551 = ~Much as I'd like to, I can't. We have to focus. I can't be distracted.~
@54552 = ~I want to kiss you.~ [BD54552]
@54553 = ~That's the best thing I've heard in a long time.~
@54554 = ~And I want to let you.~
@54555 = ~I can't, not right now. Too much requires our attention.~
@54556 = ~There's better things your lips could be doing than talking right now, <CHARNAME>. Shut up and come here.~
@54557 = ~All right. Let's go.~
@54558 = ~Gods, I hope you're right.~
@54559 = ~We've come too far to be stopped now.~
@54560 = ~There's a first time for everything.~
@54561 = ~There's only one way to find out.~
@54562 = ~You should know better than to doubt me by now.~
@54563 = ~Not quite far enough, for my taste.~
@54564 = ~We have come a long way. But not quite far enough.~
@54565 = ~I'm plenty focused right now.~
@54566 = ~All right. Let's see this thing done.~
@54567 = ~I'll take your words over roses any day, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD54567]
@54568 = ~What? Why would you even think that?~
@54569 = ~And you should know better than to take that tone with me. Come on. Let's see an end to this.~
@54570 = ~I'm almost there, Rohma. I'll be home soon...~ [BD54570]
@54571 = ~I don't think I've ever seen you smile like that before, Schael. You should do it more often.~
@54572 = ~Not nearly soon enough. But at least we're alive to make the trip. That's no small thing, considering.~
@54573 = ~Rohma? We survived one of the Nine Hells and that's all you can think of?~
@54574 = ~Come back to Baldur's Gate with me, <CHARNAME>. I'll smile a lot more once I see my daughter again.~ [BD54574]
@54575 = ~And will Rohma smile to see me, do you think?~
@54576 = ~That sounds like an invitation.~
@54577 = ~Perhaps I can coax a smile or two out of you before then.~
@54578 = ~You think about that girl too much, Corwin. It's time you did something for yourself. Past time, in fact.~
@54579 = ~There's a reason for that. Come here. Let me give you a taste of what it's an invitation to.~ [BD54579]
@54580 = ~You stink of sulfur, you know that?~
@54581 = ~I did just escape one of the Nine Hells.~
@54582 = ~I'm pretty sure that's you.~
@54583 = ~That's just my clothes. I can get rid of them easily enough.~
@54584 = ~A kiss or two and already you're trying to change me to suit your whims. No, I'll not accept it. Whatever was between us? It's done.~
@54585 = ~So what do you say? Will you come back to Baldur's Gate? With me, I mean?~
@54586 = ~Try and stop me.~
@54587 = ~What about Rohma?~
@54588 = ~You have a daughter, Corwin. And I'm... I'm not parent material. Look at my father if you don't believe me. We can't be together. For Rohma's sake.~
@54589 = ~I've indulged you for too long. No more. I'll not burden myself with your petty needs and desires.~
@54590 = ~I don't think I will. Let's go find somewhere private.~
@54591 = ~If I have to choose between you and her, you must know who I'll go with. But she wants me to be happy, and she's a sharp kid. I think she'll approve.~ [BD54591]
@54592 = ~Back to the city, then, as soon as we can. In the meantime, let's go find someplace a little more private...~ [BD54592]
@54593 = ~I'll take it. Now come here a second. There's something else I want to take.~
@54594 = ~If you knew me at all, you'd know Rohma's all I ever think of and all I ever care to think of. I thought you understood that. I guess I was wrong. Better to find out now than learn it later, I suppose. Enjoy your victory—you earned it. But you'll celebrate it without me.~ [BD54594]
@54595 = ~Let's find out.~
@54596 = ~Seriously?~
@54597 = ~No. We cannot be together, but that's not why. It's Rohma. She's lost her father and come far too close to losing her mother. I don't know what the future brings. But I couldn't bear to cause her—or you—sorrow. This is where we must part ways.~
@54598 = ~Listen, Corwin. I'm—I'm not parent material. Just look at my father if you don't believe me. Well, don't look at him; he's dead and kind of hideous. But you see what I'm getting at. You and I can't be together. For Rohma's sake.~
@54599 = ~Seriously? No. But I had you going, didn't I?~
@54600 = ~I am <PRO_MASTERMISTRESS> of my own fate. No one controls me—not even you.~
@54601 = ~Gods damn it... Gods DAMN it! You're right. I know you're right. It's just... I hoped there might be some way to, to, to work it out.~
@54602 = ~Gods damn it... Gods DAMN it! You're right. I know you're right. It's just... I hoped there might be some way to—to—to work it out. If it were just me, I'd follow you to the corners of Toril and beyond. I would.~ [BD54602]
@54603 = ~But it's not just you.~
@54604 = ~If it were just you, I'd let you. You belong with your daughter, Schael. And I don't know where I belong. Not yet.~
@54605 = ~You chose to burden yourself with a child. Now you must live with the consequences of that decision.~
@54606 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for everything, but most of all for ending this now, before... before Rohma got hurt. You don't know how much I appreciate that. Maybe someday you will, if you're lucky. Farewell.~ [BD54606]
@54607 = ~And you tell me this now, after everything we've been through, all that I endured on your behalf? You should thank Tymora we're surrounded by witnesses. If we weren't, I'd surely do something we'd both regret.~ [BD54607]
@54608 = ~You got me, all right. You're lucky you didn't get yourself an arrow in the eye. But you'll be getting luckier still, and soon.~
@54609 = ~I will. Happily. I've many regrets, <CHARNAME>. Rohma will never be one of them. Let's go.~
@54610 = ~<CHARNAME>. How are you?~ [BD54610]
@54611 = ~I've had better days.~
@54612 = ~Corwin. Thank the gods. You've got to get me out of here.~
@54613 = ~You shouldn't be here, Corwin. Go, now.~
@54614 = ~You could have worse. Eltan and Belt moved mountains to keep you alive and out of Entar's hands.~ [BD54614]
@54615 = ~I need your help, Schael. Let me out of this cell. Let me find Skie Silvershield's killer, let me prove my innocence. Please.~
@54616 = ~I'll be sure to thank them for it when next we meet.~
@54617 = ~If you expect me to thank the Grand Dukes for their hospitality, you're going to be gravely disappointed.~
@54618 = ~Let Entar come. I'll send him to join his wretched daughter.~
@54619 = ~Gods help me. How could I have missed this? How did I never see you for the monster you are?~ [BD54619]
@54620 = ~I was gravely disappointed before I ever came here.~ [BD54620]
@54621 = ~Yet you did come here. Why?~
@54622 = ~I'm not thrilled myself.~
@54623 = ~And yet here you are. Why? Not to free me, I know. You'd never defy your beloved Flaming Fist.~
@54624 = ~And what, you came here seeking solace? I've none to give. I wouldn't offer it to you even if I did. Get out. Your face sickens me. The wretched platitudes you spout make my gut churn. Go!~
@54625 = ~I would have, you know. If you'd asked me, I would have followed you anywhere, happily. It wasn't so long ago.~ [BD54625]
@54626 = ~I can't do it. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. There's only one way you're leaving here.~ [BD54626]
@54627 = ~I didn't kill Skie. You can't believe I'd ever do something like that.~
@54628 = ~We can leave here together—take Rohma and go some place no one will ever find us. Please, Schael, don't give up. There's still a future for us—if you want it.~
@54629 = ~Aye. Over the bodies of your friends and colleagues. And yours too, if you stand in my way.~
@54630 = ~If you've not come to help me, why are you here?~
@54631 = ~I don't know what to believe anymore.~ [BD54631]
@54632 = ~The next time you meet the dukes, they'll be standing in judgment over you. I don't think you'll be thanking them.~ [BD54632]
@54633 = ~And you, Schael? Are you here to judge me?~
@54634 = ~That doesn't need to happen. Help me, Schael. Get me out of this cage. We can flee the city, you and me and Rohma.~
@54635 = ~No. I'll be killing them. Every last one of the treacherous swine will fall, ere I'm done.~
@54636 = ~You think I'd turn my back on the Flaming Fist? On my father? I thought you knew me.~ [BD54636]
@54637 = ~I could kill you, <CHARNAME>. If it weren't for Rohma, I'd do it, you know. I would. You need to know how angry I am, to understand the rage I feel.~ [BD54637]
@54638 = ~I didn't kill the girl.~
@54639 = ~I'm not exactly doing a jig here, you know. ~
@54640 = ~You come to me and speak of rage? Come closer, Corwin. I would touch you one last time, and show you what true rage is.~
@54641 = ~Your glib tongue betrays you, <CHARNAME>. A girl lies dead, her blood on your hands, and all you offer is another quip. Skie deserves better than that. As do I.~ [BD54641]
@54642 = ~It doesn't matter. I wish it did, but in the end, it doesn't. If it weren't this, it would have been something else. I thought we could be together, that you and Rohma and I had a future...~ [BD54642]
@54643 = ~Even after everything that's happened in my life, I'm still just a stupid girl, blinded by—whatever it was I thought we had.~ [BD54643]
@54644 = ~It was love, Schael. It was real.~
@54645 = ~Love makes fools of us all.~
@54646 = ~You know what we had. Deny it if you must. I know the truth.~
@54647 = ~You say you loved me. I want to believe it. I do. But I can't.~ [BD54647]
@54648 = ~Love conquers all. I'm not feeling particularly victorious right now. Are you?~ [BD54648]
@54649 = ~I don't. But I still have hope.~
@54650 = ~Don't turn away from me, Schael. I need you.~
@54651 = ~All I feel is the sting of betrayal from one I believed felt for me as I did her.~
@54652 = ~Would that I could say the same. But hope is a luxury I can't allow myself. Not anymore.~ [BD54652]
@54653 = ~We had something, didn't we? I wasn't just fooling myself.~ [BD54653]
@54654 = ~We had everything. And whoever stole it from us will pay a terrible price.~
@54655 = ~If you fooled yourself, I did the same.~
@54656 = ~You tell me. What you do for me here and now—or don't do for me—will let us both know how deep and true your feelings are. Open the door, Corwin. Let me out.~
@54657 = ~Defiant until the end. But you must know this is the end. I'd give anything for that not to be the case, but it is. Accept it, as I have. Find some peace while you're still able.~ [BD54657]
@54658 = ~I—I can't do this. I've got to get out of here, out of this place... Forgive me.~ [BD54658]
@54659 = ~This is the life, isn't it? Breathing fresh air, meeting new people, some of whom aren't trying to kill us, just... adventuring. I love it. Love it.~ [BD54659]
@54660 = ~I admire your enthusiasm.~
@54661 = ~You are a delightfully mad little person.~
@54662 = ~I wish I shared your passion.~
@54663 = ~Silent or silenced, Gardnersonson. If you aren't one, I promise you will be the other.~
@54664 = ~My enthusiasm is pretty impressive, but don't let it blind you to my other endearing qualities.~ [BD54664]
@54665 = ~I look forward to learning them firsthand. We will be great friends, Glint Gardnersonson. Or would you rather I call you Three-Eyes?~
@54666 = ~Humility, for instance.~
@54667 = ~You have endearing qualities? I've yet to see them.~
@54668 = ~I try.~ [BD54668]
@54669 = ~You don't need to try on my behalf.~
@54670 = ~You might want to try a little harder.~
@54671 = ~You try too hard. Your dancing and capering do not amuse me.~
@54672 = ~Oh, I'm not. I am what I am. I couldn't hide that even if I wanted to. Which I don't.~ [BD54672]
@54673 = ~Good. We shall be great friends, you and I. I can tell.~
@54674 = ~I'm glad to hear it. The last thing I want is for you to change. I envy you, truly. Had I but a fraction of the passion you possess, I would do great things.~
@54675 = ~I don't want you to hide, gnome. I want you to shut your gods damned mouth a moment before I shut it permanently.~
@54676 = ~I don't want you to hide. You would do well to shut your gods damned mouth a moment before I shut it permanently, though.~
@54677 = ~Glint Gardnersonson, friends with the hero of Baldur's Gate. Who'd have thought?~ [BD54677]
@54678 = ~Passion? Haha. One thing at a time, <CHARNAME>. Why, we hardly know each other.~ [BD54678]
@54679 = ~You misunderstand me.~
@54680 = ~I look forward to changing that, Three-Eyes.~
@54681 = ~It is perhaps best—and safest for you—that that remain the case.~
@54682 = ~Oh, I understood you perfectly. And I hope you understand me as well. Wink.~ [BD54682]
@54683 = ~I'm not sure I follow.~
@54684 = ~Wink?~
@54685 = ~Stop talking to me. Now.~
@54686 = ~Then you aren't looking near hard enough.~ [BD54686]
@54687 = ~That is something I look forward to changing. We are going to be great friends, Three-Eyes.~
@54688 = ~Not all of us have three eyes, Three-Eyes.~
@54689 = ~Nor will I start.~
@54690 = ~Really? Well, that's your decision to make, obviously. But you don't know what you're missing.~ [BD54690]
@54691 = ~Please, call me Glint. Three-Eyes sounds more pleasant on your lips than my mother's, but most of my friends call me Glint. The very close ones call me—well, I don't want to brag.~ [BD54691]
@54692 = ~I'm not trying to amuse you. I cannot be anything but what I am, and what I am is... pretty fantastic, if I do say so myself.~ [BD54692]
@54693 = ~Something tells me you say it to yourself often, Three-Eyes.~
@54694 = ~Some things are easier said than done.~
@54695 = ~See that you say it only to yourself. It's obvious you like the sound of your own voice more than I.~
@54696 = ~Eugh. Three-Eyes sounds more pleasant on your lips than my mother's, but most of my friends call me Glint. My very close friends call me—well, I don't want to brag. Nor do I need to if you know what I mean.~ [BD54696]
@54697 = ~I could, but I prefer to focus my energies elsewhere, if you know what I mean.~ [BD54697]
@54698 = ~If you don't know what I mean, first, I find that unutterably sad, and second, I'd be happy to show you some time. Just say the word...~ [BD54698]
@54699 = ~Did I say that out loud? Because I absolutely meant to.~ [BD54699]
@54700 = ~Fair enough. There's few things I enjoy more than a challenge. I can see winning you over is going to be one, but I'm up for it.~ [BD54700]
@54701 = ~Ho, my friend. Are you having as much fun as me? Because I've got to say, I'm having a lot of fun. Even almost getting horribly slain is relatively enjoyable. As far as that sort of thing goes, I mean.~ [BD54701]
@54702 = ~I wish I felt as you do, Glint. Our conflict with the crusade has already cost the Sword Coast too much. Whoever ultimately wins, we all will have lost.~
@54703 = ~I hear you, friend. I went through six of the Nine Hells fighting Sarevok, but now I'm the hero of Baldur's Gate. What's not to love?~
@54704 = ~I rather enjoy the killing part.~
@54705 = ~I find nothing enjoyable in this. If you do, keep it to yourself. I don't want to hear it.~
@54706 = ~We make a fine pair, don't we, you and me? The hero of Baldur's Gate and his right-hand gnome.~ [BD54706]
@54707 = ~If a finer pair of men have walked the Sword Coast, I've not heard of them.~
@54708 = ~An apt description if ever I've heard one. Of course, I am left-handed...~
@54709 = ~Don't flatter yourself. You serve me no better than any other. If anything, you hold me back.~
@54710 = ~I'm sorry to hear you say that. Sorrier than I'd have thought, actually, but had you said nothing, I'd never have thought of you speaking thus.~ [BD54710]
@54711 = ~Apparently, I misunderstood the nature of our relationship. I'll not make that mistake again.~ [BD54711]
@54712 = ~Gods! If I thought as you do I'd have thrown myself from a cliff ages ago. There's misery enough in this world. I'll not add to it, not willingly, and neither should you.~ [BD54712]
@54713 = ~Gods! If I thought as you do, I'd have thrown myself from a cliff ages ago. How you can do what we do and find no joy in it, I'll never understand. In truth, it's not something I care to understand. There's misery enough in this world as it is.~
@54714 = ~Yes, I noticed. Me, I'm a lover, not a fighter. But you've got to take your happiness where you can find it, as my grandmum used to say.~ [BD54714]
@54715 = ~There could be none finer than us. Me, with my wit and charm and looks, and you with... everything you've got.~ [BD54715]
@54716 = ~You don't know what I have to offer? I thought you more perceptive than that.~
@54717 = ~A touch, a touch, I do confess it. I am skewered on your rapier wit. Mercy, please, I beg you.~
@54718 = ~Ow.~
@54719 = ~I've got nothing for you, little man. Now return your lollygagging tongue to your skull before I cut it off.~
@54720 = ~Hah! There's the smile I was looking for. And as always, well worth the effort.~ [BD54720]
@54721 = ~My apologies, <CHARNAME>. If I gave offense, please believe there was none intended. Apparently, I misunderstood the nature of our relationship. I'll not make that mistake again.~ [BD54721]
@54722 = ~Oh dear. I... I don't feel so well.~ [BD54722]
@54723 = ~Glint? What's the matter?~
@54724 = ~How not well is not so well?~
@54725 = ~Pull it together, Glint. This is no place for the faint of heart.~
@54726 = ~You say that as though someone cares.~
@54727 = ~Did I not mention not feeling so well? I could've sworn I had...~ [BD54727]
@54728 = ~Could you be a little more specific?~
@54729 = ~You're not feeling so bad that you've lost your sense of humor.~
@54730 = ~I try to be nice and what do I get for it?~
@54731 = ~Suffer in silence, Gardnersonson. I don't want to hear it.~
@54732 = ~I'm tired, <CHARNAME>. I'm so, SO tired. I don't think I got enough sleep the last time we rested. Or any sleep at all, now that I think of it.~ [BD54732]
@54733 = ~What? Why not?~
@54734 = ~Do you need to rest?~
@54735 = ~If you think we're stopping to rest on your account, you'd best think again.~
@54736 = ~You were lying right there. I was... entranced. I didn't want to close my eyes. I was afraid I'd open them and you'd be gone.~ [BD54736]
@54737 = ~I'd never abandon you, Glint. You're my right-hand gnome.~
@54738 = ~Seriously?~
@54739 = ~You have the soul of a poet. I despise poets.~
@54740 = ~In all my years I don't believe I've heard anything quite so pathetic as that.~
@54741 = ~No, no, not—not really. But I was watching you. And then you—I think you started dreaming. Whatever was happening, it wasn't good. So I stayed awake, to make sure you were all right.~ [BD54741]
@54742 = ~As any good right-hand gnome would. You are a true friend, Glint.~
@54743 = ~That's moderately disturbing. In a charming way, to be sure, but even so.~
@54744 = ~Take care of yourself, little man, and leave me to do the same.~
@54745 = ~Surely the hero of Baldur's Gate is accustomed to having the eyes of others upon him? Not that that's why I was looking at you. Fame is fleeting. What draws me to you has more substance than that.~ [BD54745]
@54746 = ~Give me a moment, please. I just need a few seconds to clear my mind and find a little focus.~ [BD54746]
@54747 = ~Whatever time you need, my friend. I wouldn't want you feeling any less than your best when we face the trials ahead.~
@54748 = ~Just a little, I hope. Your addled pate is part of your charm.~
@54749 = ~Take as long as you want. In fact, take longer. Stay here. I'll fetch you when I've done what I came to do. Perhaps.~
@54750 = ~Only because I thought someone might. Thanks for straightening that out for me.~ [BD54750]
@54751 = ~If you can't laugh, you've got nothing.~ [BD54751]
@54752 = ~Misery loves company, <CHARNAME>. And the way I feel right now, you're good company indeed.~ [BD54752]
@54753 = ~Right. I'll stay here then; get some rest. It'll be easier to do without you around to distract me.~ [BD54753]
@54754 = ~I am, aren't I? But your right-hand gnome's letting you down right now.~ [BD54754]
@54755 = ~Of course, of course. I just need to pick up the pieces a bit, move from totally shattered to my more typical mildly fragmented.~ [BD54755]
@54756 = ~And now I have. Thank you for your patience, <CHARNAME>. I appreciate it. But that's enough time wasted—let's be about our business, eh?~ [BD54756]
@54757 = ~There are some who'd appreciate the sentiment. I thought you might be one of them. You have my thanks for straightening that out.~ [BD54757]
@54758 = ~I'm feeling better by the second. Give me a minute and I'll be ready to take on the crusade single-handed. Which would probably get me killed. So give me half a minute—then we can face the crusade together. I'm more likely to survive that way, and if I don't, I can think of worse places to die than at your side.~ [BD54758]
@54759 = ~So, <CHARNAME>, there's something I can't help but notice about you of late...~ [BD54759]
@54760 = ~Oh?~
@54761 = ~Just one thing? I'd have hoped you noticed a bit more than that.~
@54762 = ~If you couldn't help but notice it, you've been looking too closely. Cast your eyes elsewhere—preferably somewhere they'll do some good.~
@54763 = ~Your eye seems to have been wandering. Some looks you've given other people make me uneasy.~ [BD54763]
@54764 = ~My eyes do more than wander—they rove, they explore, looking for possibilities in each situation I find myself in. I'd be dead a dozen times over were it otherwise.~
@54765 = ~Is my right-hand gnome feeling underappreciated? That is adorable.~
@54766 = ~You want me to what, close my eyes as we hunt the most dangerous woman on the Sword Coast?~
@54767 = ~That is a problem for you to resolve. When you do, let me know.~
@54768 = ~Of course I notice the—you know, the usual things. They're hard to miss, especially when you're looking for them as hard as I do. But...~ [BD54768]
@54769 = ~Don't tease. Well, tease, but don't tease in quite that way.~ [BD54769]
@54770 = ~How would you like to be teased?~
@54771 = ~Come here and I'll tease you some more. You'll like it, I promise.~
@54772 = ~In seriousness, then: This neediness is beneath you, and worse, it wearies me. My eyes go where they will, as I do. If you take issue with that, our friendship will not last.~
@54773 = ~Oh, I did like that. All right. Well. I—I'm feeling better about things. Let's, uh... Let's do whatever it is we're here to do again. Yeah?~ [BD54773]
@54774 = ~I didn't realize my gaze was so unwelcome. Forgive me. In future, I'll try to keep my thoughts to myself.~ [BD54774]
@54775 = ~I'll believe that when I see it, gnome—perhaps not even then. If I cut your tongue from your mouth and your fingers from your hands, still you'd find a way to make your thoughts known. It's a weakness of your character: You cannot help yourself.~
@54776 = ~I don't want you to close your eyes. I WOULD, however, prefer your gaze linger longer upon me and less upon our friends.~ [BD54776]
@54777 = ~Know this, then, and may the gods strike me down if I lie: Had I the option, I would look at nothing and no one but you. You're the one I want, Glint, you and no other. Come here now, and kiss me.~
@54778 = ~You're an attractive man, Glint, but eyes can see danger as well as beauty.~
@54779 = ~My eyes will wander where they will, as will my hands, as will every other part of me.~
@54780 = ~I've demanded nothing of you yet. Rest assured I won't change that any time soon.~
@54781 = ~That's not the sort of looking I mean, and you know it isn't.~ [BD54781]
@54782 = ~I merely tried to make a point. Yes, on occasion my gaze alights upon another. But never doubt I would be happier had I no option but to look at you, and only you. If you want proof, it's here on my lips. Here, let me show you.~
@54783 = ~You really are upset, aren't you? Forgive me, Glint. Tell me how I can allay these fears.~
@54784 = ~My eyes go where they will, as do I. If you've a problem with that, our friendship will not last.~
@54785 = ~You don't know? Come here, then. Let me give you an example.~ [BD54785]
@54786 = ~Maglubiyet's fist! I don't want to listen to this mush.~ [BD54786]
@54787 = ~You'd throw it all away, just like that? I thought—I hoped what we shared, what I thought we shared, would mean more to you. You are right. Best we end this now and save ourselves regret later.~ [BD54787]
@54788 = ~You know, I really think I must love you, <CHARNAME>. There aren't many men I'd follow into one of the Nine Hells.~ [BD54788]
@54789 = ~Most would end up having to follow you. You have a habit of rushing in where solars and sensible folk fear to tread.~
@54790 = ~Flattery will get you everywhere. Specifically, it'll get you into one of the Nine Hells. It's possible flattery wasn't the best idea in this case.~
@54791 = ~Love means nothing where we're going.~
@54792 = ~What's the point of moving if you know where you're going to end up?~
@54793 = ~In a thousand years I'd never have guessed I'd end up in Avernus.~
@54794 = ~Avoiding going to places like Avernus.~
@54795 = ~Precisely the sort of fuzzy thinking that gets people killed.~
@54796 = ~I regret nothing! Sure, I face the legions of Avernus, but at least I'm doing so with decent company. I've faced worse than this in my time. ~ [BD54792]
@54797 = ~I can think of no one I'd rather charge into the Nine Hells with than you.~
@54798 = ~You have?~
@54799 = ~I regret little, but throwing my lot in with a mad gnome might qualify.~
@54800 = ~I always figured there was a chance. Could be worse, though. At least I've some decent company. That's always better than traveling alone, don't you think?~ [BD54800]
@54801 = ~I can think of no one I'd rather charge into the Nine Hells with than you.~
@54802 = ~Perhaps we could wait till after we've escaped the pit before we discuss the relative merits of traveling companions.~
@54803 = ~It depends entirely who one's traveling with. I'm increasingly of the opinion that I made a serious error including you in this venture.~
@54804 = ~No.~
@54805 = ~You need to relax, <CHARNAME>. Embrace the unknown. Take a deep breath—actually, don't do that; the last thing you need is sulfur-filled lungs. Hey, did I ever tell you about the time I explored the tunnels under Waterdeep?~ [BD54805]
@54806 = ~You always say the nicest things. Come here a second. I'm not thrilled with the idea of a fiery death, but I'd be even less thrilled if I didn't take the chance to kiss you before it.~ [BD54806]
@54807 = ~Ah, it's only a Hell. I've faced worse.~ [BD54807]
@54808 = ~You have?~
@54809 = ~You liar. You lying lying liar...~
@54810 = ~You'll face me if you don't shut your mouth and focus on the task at hand.~
@54811 = ~I have! When I was just a lad, I was exploring a cavern under Waterdeep at the behest of a lovely older man who taught me—maybe I'll save that for another time?~ [BD54811]
@54812 = ~Epic tale of adventure and romance short, I stumbled into a portal to the Abyss. You think Avernus is bad? The Nine Hells have rules. The Abyss is a riddle wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma that's been swallowed by utter bloody chaos.~ [BD54812]
@54813 = ~I got out of that using nothing but my wits. We'll get through Avernus too.~ [BD54813]
@54814 = ~I believe you.~
@54815 = ~If you believe that, I've got a bridge over the Blood River to sell you.~
@54816 = ~Avernus will be the least of your worries if you don't shut your damned mouth!~
@54817 = ~That's what I like about you, <CHARNAME>. You're so delightfully gullible. C'mere. One more kiss and we'll go finish this.~ [BD54817]
@54818 = ~Aaaand let's go finish this!~ [BD54818]
@54819 = ~Let's go find out, shall we?~ [BD54819]
@54820 = ~Love means everything, no matter where you are. If you don't understand that, I—I don't even know who you are. I guess I'm about to find out, aren't I?~ [BD54820]
@54821 = ~Fair point. But if it doesn't get you killed, it can take you to some fun and interesting places. And also Avernus. Well, they can't all be winners.~ [BD54821]
@54822 = ~Well, that's... disappointing. Let's go finish this, then, and quickly. I wouldn't want to keep you from your precious solitude.~ [BD54822]
@54823 = ~Look, <CHARNAME>, I don't want to tell you your business, but maybe it's not the best idea to insult a close friend and ally seconds before you face the legions of Avernus. Just putting that out there. Do with it what you will. In the meantime, let's go see an end to this.~ [BD54823]
@54824 = ~Oh, do you think we'll get to see the Blood River? That would be amazing. What're we waiting for? Let's do this!~ [BD54824]
@54825 = ~Heya.~ [BD54825]
@54826 = ~It's you, Glint. I feared—I was afraid I'd never see you again.~
@54827 = ~Glint! Thank the gods. Get this door open.~
@54828 = ~Go away, Glint. I don't want to talk to you.~
@54829 = ~Don't. Don't say that word. It's not for you.~
@54830 = ~Don't do this, <CHARNAME>. Not now.~ [BD54830]
@54831 = ~What would you have me do, then? Thrash and rage and scream at the injustice of it all?~
@54832 = ~Nothing good can come of your being here. I don't want you to see me like this. Leave me to my misery, I beg you.~
@54833 = ~I said go. Get out of here!~
@54834 = ~I'd not deny any man, much less you, his final wish, especially one so easily provided as this. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>. We'll not meet again, I think. But I dearly hope I'm wrong.~ [BD54834]
@54835 = ~Do you think that would help?~ [BD54835]
@54836 = ~No.~
@54837 = ~It couldn't hurt.~
@54838 = ~Not nearly as much as freeing me from this cell would. Open the door. Release me.~
@54839 = ~I wouldn't, then.~ [BD54839]
@54840 = ~Why are you here, Glint?~
@54841 = ~Hey, you know what would help is getting me out of this bloody cell. Anything you can do for me on that?~
@54842 = ~Enough talk. Open the cell door. Release me.~
@54843 = ~I've tried to let it go, <CHARNAME>. I have, truly, but I can't. I need to know what there was between you and the Silvershield girl.~ [BD54843]
@54844 = ~Nothing. There was nothing between us. I didn't kill her, Glint. I couldn't have.~
@54845 = ~In the end? A dagger's hilt and not much else.~
@54846 = ~You think I killed her? I wish I had. I'll swing for her death regardless of the truth.~
@54847 = ~This isn't a joke!~
@54848 = ~I would if I could. Well, I suppose I'm technically capable of pulling it off. What I mean is, I would if I could and not get cut down by the small army of Flaming Fist mercenaries down the hall who're clearly looking for any excuse to cut down a dashing gnome in the prime of his life.~ [BD54848]
@54849 = ~I am so sorry. I've been trying to find a way to get you out of here that wouldn't end up with both of us prematurely dead. I plan to keep trying until I find one.~ [BD54849]
@54850 = ~If you aren't here to free me, why have you come?~
@54851 = ~You'll find a way, I'm sure. I have faith in you.~
@54852 = ~Go, then. Go and don't return until you're able to release me from this fetid hole.~
@54853 = ~I'd give it a try, then. Eh, preferably after I leave.~ [BD54853]
@54854 = ~You haven't come to free me?~
@54855 = ~I assume you mean after WE leave.~
@54856 = ~You intend to abandon me too, then. I suppose I should have expected nothing better.~
@54857 = ~I could say I love you, and I wouldn't be lying. But I would be lying if I said I loved you more than I do living. There's a Flaming Fist army down the hall who're clearly looking for any excuse to cut down a dashing gnome in the prime of his life.~ [BD54857]
@54858 = ~Goodbye. If we don't see each other again, I—I want you to know the time we spent together was, it was... I'm sorry. I can't do this. Forgive me. I can't.~ [BD54858]
@54859 = ~Let me out of here! Let me out now!~ [BD54859]
@54860 = ~Good, that's good. Keep your spirits up... I, uh, there's something I need to ask you.~ [BD54860]
@54861 = ~You almost didn't. I needed some time to come to terms with what you—what they say you did. And I still haven't.~ [BD54861]
@54862 = ~Were you—were you with her? Did you kill her? I saw you, you know. The blood on your hands, the dagger at your feet...~ [BD54862]
@54863 = ~Listen to me, Glint. Whether I live or die, it doesn't matter, but you must believe this. There was nothing between me and Skie. I had no reason to kill her, none. I don't know what happened that night, not yet. But I didn't kill Skie Silvershield. I couldn't have.~
@54864 = ~Yeah. Not exactly the perfect murder, was it?~
@54865 = ~Do you truly think me so stupid? I had ample opportunities to kill the wench. Why would I kill her then? Why would I simply stand there, dripping in her blood? No. I don't know what happened. But I know what didn't.~
@54866 = ~You're a child of Bhaal. Is it possible you killed her without realizing?~ [BD54866]
@54867 = ~I don't want to believe it. But... I can't lie to you, Glint. I don't know. Once, I thought myself free of my father's influence. Now I question everything I've ever seen and done.~
@54868 = ~I can't deny the possibility. I really want to, though.~
@54869 = ~I was born to murder. These hands were made to kill. My eyes were made to watch my victims clutch desperately for life as it slips away, my ears to hear their final rattling breath. To kill someone and not know it? Impossible.~
@54870 = ~I don't want to believe it, either. So I won't. Be strong, <CHARNAME>. I will find a way to get you out of here.~ [BD54870]
@54871 = ~So you didn't kill her because you'd enjoy killing her too much not to take credit for killing her if you had killed her. I'll be honest: That's not the strongest defense I've ever heard.~ [BD54871]
@54872 = ~But I know you well enough to know it's honest. And I'll not see you hang for a crime you didn't commit. Be strong. I will find a way to get you out of this place.~ [BD54872]
@54873 = ~Goodbye, <CHARNAME>. We'll not meet again, I think. But I dearly hope I'm wrong.~
@54874 = ~Oh? What precisely did you hear?~
@54875 = ~Treason against the rulers of this great city.~
@54876 = ~Things you really don't want to make their way to the Grand Dukes. Let's talk about how much you're ready to spend to make sure that doesn't happen, shall we?~
@54877 = ~Nothing I've not heard many times since Sarevok's fall. The Council is weak. They must be removed.~
@54878 = ~I heard three nobles plotting against the rulers of Baldur's Gate. A plot I would very much like to be a part of.~
@54879 = ~I suggest we convene another time. Good <DAYNIGHTALL> to all of you.~
@54880 = ~The only place you're going is prison.~
@54881 = ~I'd be happy to let you noble folk go on your way, and happier still to return this letter to you—for a price.~
@54882 = ~I'm happy to let you noble folk go on your way. And happier still to forget what I've heard this night—for a price.~

@54885 = ~Indeed <PRO_HESHE> would—if we could trust <PRO_HIMHER>. Grand Duke Belt and the Council have treated you very well these past weeks, <CHARNAME>. Why turn against them now?~
@54886 = ~This is the first opportunity that's presented itself.~
@54887 = ~My lords, and lady: Many have come to me, asking me to side with them against the Council. Some had the steel to defeat Eltan; some were worthy, and wise enough to chart a new course for the city. But it is only in you three that I see all the qualities necessary to rule effectively. You, and you alone, are capable of both defeating and replacing the Grand Dukes.~

@54894 = ~That's what I wanted to hear. A little too close to what I wanted to hear for me to believe. Good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you, <CHARNAME>. Come, Maxwell, Therton. Let us leave this place.~
@54895 = ~What about Eldric?~
@54896 = ~Forget Eldric, you idiot! We've got to get out of here.~
@54897 = ~That would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~

@54901 = ~Where is he?~

@54908 = ~No. I did find this letter you might be interested in. I certainly was.~
@54909 = ~Oh, right. I was going to find Eldric. I'll be right back.~
@54910 = ~I didn't—he must be the same place as my patience. Let's talk about what you're going to give me to keep your little conspiracy a secret from the Grand Dukes.~
@54911 = ~Still? Damn that man! If we didn't need his connections... Well, go find him then. We'll await you here.~
@54912 = ~Be quick about it. We can't stay here all night.~

@54927 = ~So I'll hold here. I'll follow you out when you're ready to leave.~
@54928 = ~Yes, you're very funny. Happy now? Then go, get what you need.~
@54929 = ~I'd rather they not get the chance to raise their hands at all. I'll follow you out when you leave.~
@54930 = ~Few knew we might come here, much less when. There's no way they could have an ambush prepared. Anyone who wants a shot at you will have to get past me first. Even so, we've no time to waste. Go get what you need, the sooner we leave here the happier I'll be.~
@54931 = ~Got everything you need?~ [BD54931]
@54932 = ~I have. ~
@54933 = ~Yes, but I want to look around a little while longer, if I may. ~
@54934 = ~No. But what I seek I'll not find here. ~

@54944 = ~Is there anything I can do to help? ~
@54945 = ~Better that than terribly hurt, which I promise you will be should you fail to serve me forthwith.~
@54946 = ~Refugees from this so-called "crusade" in the Troll Hills have filled the city almost to bursting. Everyone is hoarding supplies before demand drives prices beyond reason.~
@54947 = ~Those who flee the Shining Lady have gold enough to shop here?~
@54948 = ~Is there any way I can be of assistance?~
@54949 = ~They'll have to wait. I'm on an urgent mission for Grand Duke Silvershield.~
@54950 = ~Some escaped with money or possessions as well as their lives. Others have relatives in town helping them. Suffice it to say there is no dearth of customers willing to pay for my attention, so if you'll excuse me...~
@54951 = ~The Council of Four has engaged me to help end Caelar's crusade. May I see what you have to sell?~
@54952 = ~Is there anything I can do to help? ~
@54953 = ~I'll excuse you when our business is completed. Show me your wares before I show you your own headless body.~
@54954 = ~What could you possibly do to—wait. You're that <PRO_MANWOMAN> everyone's been talking about. The hero of Baldur's Gate, yes?~
@54955 = ~I suppose that makes you relatively trustworthy. Could you run upstairs and bring me a case of empty potion bottles? I need them to fill these orders. ~

@54959 = ~I'm afraid I've no time for trivial tasks. I'm here on the Grand Dukes' behalf. Show me your wares.~
@54960 = ~Ah. That being the case, I'll let you skip to the head of the line.~
@54961 = ~Many thanks. Here's the key to the cabinet upstairs. The outer stairs, that is; the central ones are more for show than anything else, I don't know what the builder was thinking there... but enough chitchat. Potion bottles! Go get them.~
@54962 = ~If you're not going to be of use, get out of the way. I'm busy. ~
@54963 = ~We did it! We's in! ~

@54970 = ~No, we're clerics of Lathander; perfect thyself and guard ever against pride. 'COURSE we're robbers! This shop's been wall to wall business for days now. Halbazzer must have a fortune in gold stashed in here.~

@54983 = ~Wonderful, thank you. This will be a big help. Here, a token for your troubles. Is there anything else I can help you with?~
@54984 = ~Let's see your wares. ~
@54985 = ~You should know I thwarted an attempted robbery while upstairs.~
@54986 = ~Nothing right now. ~
@54987 = ~A robbery, you say?~
@54988 = ~Yes. A dark elf used magic to penetrate the upper floor.~
@54989 = ~An attempt at one. They were a motley crew, led by a dark elf named Sethyl. Now they're a dead motley crew.~
@54990 = ~A drow, a hobgoblin, a flind, and a pet spider, unless I'm mistaken.~
@54991 = ~Ah... I know of whom you speak. Sethyl and I studied together for a time before we went our separate ways. We had a... falling out, you might say.~
@54992 = ~He vowed to ruin me. I suppose he thought hiring that crew to rob my shop might put me out of business. ~
@54993 = ~Thank you for protecting my goods—I appreciate it. Here, take this as a reward. Good folk like you are hard to find these days.~
@54994 = ~As one wizard to another, I thank you for protecting my goods. Here, please, take this as a reward.~

He rambles for hours on how different the foreign culture is to that of the Sword Coast and prides himself on being a "city samurai," a title that is as offensive as it is undeserved.

@55857 = ~It might be a what instead of a who. Barghests are shapeshifting beasts of another world, infesting this one. Monsters.~
@55858 = ~He was a monster once, in deed if not in body—a vicious warrior who lived to slaughter all who crossed his path. Then he found the Shining Lady and a purpose. As one of Caelar's faithful, he's more... focused now. But no less dangerous to those who would thwart the Shining Lady.~

@55929 = ~Nothing, right now.~
@55930 = ~Accept my apologies, <CHARNAME>. My intent was to keep you, and Imoen, safe. Caelar's assassins—indeed, ANY assassins—should never have been able to breach the palace.~ [BD55930]

@55935 = ~This city has grown soft with my victories. The first casualty was vigilance.~
@55936 = ~What happened to Imoen falls on my shoulders, and it is a harsh reminder indeed, but as you say—a necessary one. It is of little comfort now, but you have my word: I shall redouble my efforts to keep the city safe.~
@55937 = ~The same thought had occurred to me. Perhaps they believed they could slay all within the palace, and you were just one of many Caelar sought to eliminate.~
@55938 = ~By all accounts, the Shining Lady's will is iron, as are her followers'. She trusts too much in mercenaries, though—enough coin may turn that to our advantage.~
@55939 = ~Cut the head from the snake and its body will die. What do we know of Caelar Argent?~
@55940 = ~I'm not sure people who rely on the Flaming Fist should look too closely at turning mercenaries against their paymasters...~

@55942 = ~Given your success with Sarevok, I'll not bet against you. We are fortunate you're on our side.~
@55943 = ~The Flaming Fist dealt with her, but not before she managed to place a curse upon me. Irritating, but not life-threatening. Even so, I'm glad to have my true voice restored.~
@55944 = ~I can imagine. What can you tell me of this Caelar Argent?~
@55945 = ~As am I. I always thought it curious that a man of your reputation sounded so... petulant. ~
@55946 = ~I'll take my leave now. I've much to do before the expedition departs.~
@55947 = ~It didn't trouble me overly, though granted, something had obviously changed. In any event, it's resolved, thank the gods.~
@55948 = ~I've much to do and I'm sure you do as well. I'll take my leave.~
@55949 = ~What can you tell me of this Caelar Argent?~
@55950 = ~Enough talk. Neither of us have time to waste on trivialities.~
@55951 = ~Agreed. If you venture outside the palace, make sure to take Captain Corwin with you. I'd not see the hero of Baldur's Gate fall—certainly not before the situation with Caelar is resolved. ~
@55952 = ~I wish there were more to tell. Our scouts in the Troll Claws and High Moor have had little success tracking her movements. In the process, many of our people have gone missing, or worse—left our service to join her.~
@55953 = ~What could turn loyal soldiers against their own city?~
@55954 = ~A crusade implies a divine catalyst to Caelar's actions.~
@55955 = ~All of them shall fall, as will their mistress.~
@55956 = ~Adherents of many faiths flock to her banner. What she hopes to accomplish is... vague. But that's done nothing to diminish her followers' devotion.~
@55957 = ~Zealots for followers, a hidden agenda, and no idea of her plans or strategy. If she means to wage war upon us, we're already losing. What more do we know?~
@55958 = ~This is all we know of the woman who threatens us and all the Sword Coast?~
@55959 = ~Enough steel and magic can end any crusade.~
@55960 = ~She first appeared on the High Moor with a handful of followers. Their ranks swelled alarmingly fast. Initially, their efforts were geared towards taking control of Dragonspear. Once the castle was seized, more flocked to her cause. Her army spread out in all directions—and now it has reached us.~
@55961 = ~I hope you can end this threat. We will see about marshaling our own troops and preparing for another attack.~
@55962 = ~You have my thanks. If you enter the city, take Captain Corwin—and be vigilant. I had hoped for peace in the wake of the iron crisis, but it seems that is denied us for the moment.~
@55963 = ~I understand the concern, but until we know more about the nature of the threat, all options must remain on the table. ~
@55964 = ~What do we know about Caelar? ~
@55965 = ~That's the nice thing about options—it costs little to consider them. It's actions that cause all the trouble.~
@55966 = ~I already know what must be done. My path was set the moment Caelar attacked me.~
@55967 = ~Indeed, <CHARNAME>, a mind such as yours may prove stronger and sharper than any enemy blade. Continue walking the path you're on and you could someday be one of the Council of Four.~
@55968 = ~It is my honor to serve, however I am needed.~
@55969 = ~You flatter me, sir. If I really had a strategic mind, I'd be halfway to Calimshan right now, not heading north to Dragonspear.~
@55970 = ~I have set my sights higher than the walls of Baldur's Gate, Belt.~
@55971 = ~You beard it with a quick wit, <CHARNAME>, but you have more to offer the city than magic and the occasional quip. Continue down the path you're on and you could someday be one of the Council of Four.~
@55972 = ~It is my honor to serve, however I am needed.~
@55973 = ~You flatter me, sir. If I really had a strategic mind, I'd be halfway to Calimshan right now, not heading north to Dragonspear. ~
@55974 = ~I have set my sights higher than the walls of Baldur's Gate, Belt.~
@55975 = ~Ambitious as well, I see—perhaps Dragonspear will gain a new lord when Caelar Argent has been defeated? We shall see what the future holds.~
@55976 = ~The Shining Sea is lovely this time of year. If events continue in the direction they have been, I might just head south with you. But for now, my place is here—and Dragonspear is yours. Tymora bless your travels, and swift journey to you.~
@55977 = ~Ah, yes, <CHARNAME>. What does the hero of Baldur's Gate need of me?~ [BD55977]
@55978 = ~How are you, sir? How is Skie?~
@55979 = ~I would know your thoughts on what's happening in the city. ~
@55980 = ~100,000 gold and a teleportation spell to take me far away from Caelar's crusade. Failing that, you can tell me what you know of the crusade and its mistress.~
@55981 = ~Nothing at all, Duke Entar. If that changes, I'll let you know.~
@55982 = ~For now, our paths must part. May Tymora favor you in your travels.~ [BD55982]
@55983 = ~So it seems to me, at least. I am sure she would tell a different tale, were you to ask her.~ [BD55983]
@55984 = ~I may do that. For now, I'll ask what you know of the situation up north.~
@55985 = ~She claimed Caelar was a child of Bhaal. Have you any proof of that?~
@55986 = ~She's opened up to a lot of people, I hear. ~
@55987 = ~Speak with that indolent rattlebrain? I think not.~
@55988 = ~Have a care. <CHARNAME>. I am well aware of my daughter's faults, but she is MY daughter. I'll not have you or anyone else speak ill of her. This conversation is at an end.~ [BD55988]
@55989 = ~I have scattered reports, rumors, conjecture... it is said the crusade holds sway from the High Moor to the Winding Water.~ [BD55989]
@55990 = ~The High Moor and Misty Forest are Caelar's, as are the Serpent Hills and most of Trollbark Forest. She has much of the Troll Hills too, but even she avoids Warlock's Crypt—so far, at least.~ [BD55990]
@55991 = ~But for now, you must excuse me. The Council must see to the city, as you see to Caelar. Tymora favor your travels.~ [BD55991]
@55992 = ~Thanks to that damnable Argent woman, we drown in a sea of refugees. The Flaming Fist is having trouble enough keeping order as it is, and will have more when the Dragonspear expedition leaves.~ [BD55992]
@55993 = ~I don't know if Caelar seeks to cripple Baldur's Gate, but if that is the goal, she may well achieve it.~ [BD55993]
@55994 = ~Have we any idea what her goal might be?~
@55995 = ~Will the Fist be able to keep the peace with its forces spread out?~
@55996 = ~She must be stopped, and she will be. I will put an end to her, as she sought to do to me.~
@55997 = ~Ideas? Certainly. Facts, not so much.~ [BD55997]
@55998 = ~I don't care who kills Caelar, provided they do so quickly.~ [BD55998]
@55999 = ~Eltan would know better than I. Given the attack on the palace, Caelar is moving more quickly than we anticipated. As for what happens next, your guess is as good as mine. Perhaps better.~ [BD55999]
@56000 = ~Greetings, <CHARNAME>. How are you holding up?~ [BD56000]
@56001 = ~Well enough, sir. And you? ~
@56002 = ~I'm still not accustomed to people trying to kill me for no apparent reason, but I could be worse.~
@56003 = ~I'll survive. ~
@56004 = ~My feelings are of no consequence. I suggest you concern yourself with matters that are.~
@56005 = ~A refreshing perspective. My friends on the Council are inclined to view the tankard as half-empty.~ [BD56005]
@56006 = ~You are all seasoned adventurers. It must be difficult, knowing of Caelar's threat yet unable to deal with it personally.~
@56007 = ~Baldur's Gate overflows with newcomers, assassins roam the Ducal Palace... Their pessimism is understandable.~
@56008 = ~Weakness invites defeat. Caelar acts without hesitation or doubt. We must do no less.~
@56009 = ~A Calishite monk once told me every night is dawn's herald. The trick is to hold on to the memory of light until the darkness breaks.~ [BD56009]
@56010 = ~They call Caelar the Shining Lady. She fancies herself the light that will break the darkness.~
@56011 = ~I'm holding on, if only by my fingertips.~
@56012 = ~The night is a veil draped across the ugly face of the world—nothing to fear.~
@56013 = ~Darkness is a handy tool, for those who know how to use it.~
@56014 = ~I have been called many things in my time, <CHARNAME>, but my mother was no dog. Names are just words, and words can be twisted. However Caelar or her followers try to justify their actions, they are disrupting commerce throughout the Sword Coast, and our people suffer for it.~
@56015 = ~Few could withstand the forces aligned against her.~
@56016 = ~Is it the people who concern you, duke? Or the commerce? ~
@56017 = ~Not for long. Caelar tried to kill me. She will answer for it.~
@56018 = ~Your words are welcome, <CHARNAME>, and they give us hope in these difficult times.~ [BD56018]
@56019 = ~As pleasant as it is to speak with you, I am required elsewhere right now.~ [BD56019]
@56020 = ~Oh—if you do venture into the city, be sure to take Captain Corwin with you. A talented officer, that one. She'll take care of you.~ [BD56020]
@56021 = ~I see...~ [BD56021]
@56022 = ~After Sarevok's defeat, I had hoped for peace, but it was not to be. I grow too old for this sort of thing. Once, it would have excited me. Now I am simply weary.~ [BD56022]
@56023 = ~You'd think that, wouldn't you? But no. No, that isn't the problem, or MY problem, at least.~ [BD56023]
@56024 = ~A bleak view, but one that seems to have served you well enough thus far.~ [BD56024]
@56025 = ~A tool you can neither control nor hold in your hand is not something I'd rely upon. But I'll not argue the point.~ [BD56025]
@56026 = ~Let us hope Caelar isn't one of them.~ [BD56026]
@56027 = ~What use is the heart without blood, or lungs without air? One needs the other. To ignore either does both a disservice.~ [BD56027]
@56028 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>. I am glad to see you well.~ [BD56028]

@56030 = ~As well as an assassin's target can be, Grand Duke Jannath.~
@56031 = ~And I, you. Tell me, how fares Imoen?~
@56032 = ~It's worrisome that the palace was so easily penetrated—and to learn that Caelar's reach extends this far beyond the Winding Water.~ [BD56032]
@56033 = ~What do we know of her plans? ~
@56034 = ~I've thought more of Caelar than I care to of late. How goes Imoen's magical training?~
@56035 = ~In attacking me, she has overextended herself.~
@56036 = ~Precious little. She claims herself an instrument of the gods—which gods are a matter of some debate—on a divine mission. As to what that mission is? It is as countless as the mouths that praise her—and those that curse her.~ [BD56036]
@56037 = ~Yes. I've little time for pleasantries these days, unfortunately. The standard duties of the Council take up considerable time on the best of days, and we haven't had those of late. Add my students' training on top of that and I've barely a minute to call my own.~
@56038 = ~Have faith, Mistress Jannath. Better days lie ahead. Tell me, what do you know of Caelar Argent? ~
@56039 = ~Speaking of training—how is Imoen's progressing? ~
@56040 = ~Cloakshadow's cloak's shadow, <CHARNAME>! There's nothing to be gained from insulting the man. Forgive my friend, cousin. She was raised in Candlekeep. Monks, you know?~ [BD56040]
@56041 = ~Our gratitude and prayers go with you, <CHARNAME>. Until we speak again.~ [BD56041]
@56042 = ~She is an attentive student, but magic requires a clarity of thought and feeling she struggles to maintain. Still, that's not unusual for one her age.~ [BD56042]
@56043 = ~In time, I am certain she will be able to access AND control the Weave's power. But she must be patient and take the time to know all facets of the craft. Failure to do so could be disastrous.~ [BD56043]
@56044 = ~You don't think I should take her to Dragonspear? ~
@56045 = ~Define "disastrous."~
@56046 = ~I will bear this in mind. ~
@56047 = ~I will advise her to remain in Baldur's Gate while you journey to Dragonspear, if that's what you're asking. Whether she takes my advice is another matter.~ [BD56047]
@56048 = ~She'll accompany you if she wishes—you know her well enough to know she'll not be swayed once she's made a decision. But she's not nearly ready to use magic.~ [BD56048]
@56049 = ~While her other skills may prove useful to you, she's at a critical time in her training. Her past instincts pull her one way, her study of the craft another.~ [BD56049]
@56050 = ~Until that conflict is resolved, you will find her less than effective as a magic user or a practitioner of her... other skills.~ [BD56050]
@56051 = ~That's why she was reluctant to assist in rooting out Sarevok's minions...~
@56052 = ~So she's of no use as a thief or a magician? ~
@56053 = ~Redblooding hells. She could barely pick a pocket as it was—now she can't even do that?~
@56054 = ~She cares for you, <CHARNAME>. The last thing she wants is to be a burden—but until she fully recovers and her training is complete, I fear she would be.~ [BD56054]
@56055 = ~I am glad we had a chance to speak before you depart. But now, I must go. There are many demands on my time. If I do not attend to them, their number will only grow. Farewell.~ [BD56055]
@56056 = ~I fear we are missing something here, <CHARNAME>. Caelar's actions make little sense. Why would she attack you? And if she succeeded—what does she gain from killing the hero of Baldur's Gate?~ [BD56056]
@56057 = ~Perhaps I'll find the answer in Dragonspear Castle.~
@56058 = ~It would be a crushing blow to the city's morale, surely?~
@56059 = ~Whatever her aim, she missed her mark. I won't.~
@56060 = ~Between the iron crisis, the refugees, and the tales they tell of the crusade, I doubt our people's morale could sink much lower. But I have no better explanation for Caelar's attack upon you.~ [BD56060]
@56061 = ~Baeloth, you've got a way with words. Can you try singing to the menhir?~
@56062 = ~If any can sing a soothing song to soften a stone, 'tis I!~ [BD56062]
@56063 = ~I shall wrack my rationality for a ritual to cause this reticent rock to relent!~ [BD56063]
@56064 = ~Though I am no bard, I shall bestow my bewitching vocals on this baffling boulder!~ [BD56064]
@56065 = ~My melodious murmurs will melt this mysterious menhir!~ [BD56065]
@56066 = ~A better one than you deserve. Now either charm the stone, if you can, or stop talking. For sanity's sake.~ [BD56066]
@56067 = ~Fine. I've warmed up colder fellas than this hunk of rock here. Watch an expert in action.~ [BD56067]
@56068 = ~I'm all over it, sugar.~ [BD56068]
@56069 = ~Surely my sibilant syllables will sway this stony slab!~ [BD56069]
@56070 = ~Ancient Menhirs

I've solved the mystery of the menhirs.

By activating each menhir, I released the voice of Crommus, a long-dead minstrel. I also summoned the spirit of his love, Carline, who had gone mad from her years as a ghost. I destroyed her.~
@56071 = ~Runes eroded by time mark one face of this tall stone menhir. One image shows a man lying on his back, his eyes closed, while six small clouds fly away from him.~
@56072 = ~That was the best thing for her. I know you don't want to hear it, Crommus, but in your heart you know it is true.~
@56073 = ~Carline, do you not recognize me? It is I, your love, Crommus!~
@56074 = ~She's confused. Spirits often are. Carline, listen to me. You had an unhappy life after you lost your lover, but now you are reunited. Look at him. You know who he is.~
@56075 = ~M'Khiin, the girl's spirit is confused. Can you help her?~
@56076 = ~Give her a moment to recover herself. Dying can really shake you up.~
@56077 = ~The spirit's gone mad—it must be destroyed!~
@56078 = ~Please, try to calm her down!~
@56079 = ~Carline, listen to me. You had an unhappy life after you lost your lover, but now you are reunited. Look at him. You know who he is.~
@56080 = ~Carline, I am a bard like Crommus. Listen to my voice. You can hear my sincerity, surely? Believe me when I say Artipheon is long dead. Nothing stands 'twixt you and your love now.~
@56081 = ~Calm yourself, spirit. Use the senses the gods gave you immediately or pay the price!~
@56082 = ~Don't know. I'll try. Spirit! Open your clouded eyes. Leave the past behind you. See the truth of now.~ [BD56082]
@56083 = ~You will plague me no longer, Artipheon! Your end is nigh!~ [BD56083]
@56084 = ~Carline! NO!~
@56085 = ~I... I remember. Crommus—it's you; I see you! Oh, Crommus, my love!~ [BD56085]
@56086 = ~<CHARNAME>. What do you need?~ [BD56086]
@56087 = ~I want you to come with me.~
@56088 = ~Your skills are wasted here. Stay here and they'll waste away entirely. Join me and I promise I'll find a way to put them to better use.~
@56089 = ~For the moment, nothing.~
@56090 = ~From you? Don't flatter yourself.~
@56091 = ~The Grand Dukes wanted me to watch out for you. That'll be easier to do at your side than it will be from here. Let's go.~
@56092 = ~If that changes, you know where to find me.~
@56093 = ~Suit yourself. If you do think of something you want, you know where to find me.~
@56094 = ~It was easier than you'd think. Frighteningly easy, actually.~
@56095 = ~<CHARNAME> played a s-significant role in end-ending the iron crisis.~
@56096 = ~S-stop that. You'll m-make them nervous. Don't worry about <PRO_HIMHER>, Mari—<PRO_HESHE>'s on our side. Th-this is <CHARNAME>.~
@56097 = ~You'll forgive me if I don't go ahead and do that on your say-so, I hope. If you don't, that's something I imagine I can live with.~
@56098 = ~I like to tell myself that, though truth be known, I really just keep Mari company. She's the one that's got the last key that makes the bloody thing work.~
@56099 = ~The bridge mechanism's old—it b-broke three of the last f-four keys. Mari's is the only one left. I've b-been meaning to talk to H-hillcarver about m-making another, just in c-case, but there's not b-been much call to lower the b-bridge of late.~
@56100 = ~Yes, I hold the only key. That's the safest way. Half the people hiding in the fort are strangers. Can't trust 'em. Not a single one.~
@56101 = ~I can see it's in good hands. Look after it, Mari. If the gods favor us, it won't be long before the drawbridge can be lowered again.~
@56102 = ~That probably prevented a lot of desertions.~
@56103 = ~I want you to lower the drawbridge now, Mari.~
@56104 = ~You are t-too cynical, <CHARNAME>. These are g-good people. They s-stayed be-because they will not be c-cowed by Caelar Argent's thugs.~
@56105 = ~Reckon you may be right about that, <CHARNAME>. There's other ways out of the fort, but most people only know about this one. And this one isn't opening.~
@56106 = ~It will, when the time is right. The crusade will pay for what it's done here, I promise you that.~
@56107 = ~Mm, now, see, I was really hoping you weren't going to say that, because I'd kind of like the drawbridge lowered.~
@56108 = ~Actually, it is. Now.~
@56109 = ~Do what <PRO_HESHE> says, Mari. <CHARNAME> has experience resolving situations like this.~
@56110 = ~Khalid? The decision is yours to make—yours and yours alone. Do I lower the bridge?~
@56111 = ~Do it, Mari. Let us see an en-an end to this.~
@56112 = ~As you wish.~
@56113 = ~Wh-what are you p-p-planning at, <CHARNAME>?~
@56114 = ~Lowering the bridge would be the death of us all. I'm not going to do it.~
@56115 = ~I see you take your duties very seriously. Very well, I'm not inclined to press this—at least not yet.~
@56116 = ~We don't have a lot of options here. Our best bet is to attack the crusade immediately.~
@56117 = ~Not lowering the drawbridge will most certainly be the death of YOU. Do as I say or pay the price.~
@56118 = ~What are you d-doing, <CHARNAME>? I'll n-not stand here in silence while you threaten one of m-my people.~
@56119 = ~Don't be foolish, <CHARNAME>. There's no need for this sort of thuggery.~
@56120 = ~Get this scum away from me, Khalid, or by the gods I'll put <PRO_HIMHER> down.~
@56121 = ~You take your duties very seriously. Good. That's good. I'll leave you to them, for now.~
@56122 = ~We attack the crusade now. It's our only option.~
@56123 = ~The only thing you're putting down is the drawbridge.~
@56124 = ~Why are you doing this? There's no reason, no sense in it at all.~
@56125 = ~Get <PRO_HIMHER> away from me, Khalid. NOW.~
@56126 = ~I told you to get out of here. You should have listened.~
@56127 = ~C-calm down, Mari. Th-this is, isn't the t-time to let t-t-tempers flare...~
@56128 = ~Why didn't you LISTEN?~
@56129 = ~Mari, no!~
@56130 = ~I won't let you hurt her!~
@56131 = ~Khalid, what are you doing?~
@56132 = ~What I must!~
@56133 = ~Then I am with you.~
@56134 = ~Oh, thank the gods...~
@56135 = ~No. I suppose I don't. Very well, if you think you can get everyone out alive, I'll not stand in your way.~
@56136 = ~Surrender? To the crusade? Not while I live.~
@56137 = ~There's no harm in talking to them, at least.~
@56138 = ~Give <CHARNAME> a chance, Mari. I fear <PRO_HESHE> is our b-best hope for survival n-now.~
@56139 = ~If you say <PRO_HESHE>'s good, I'll take you at your word. But if <PRO_HESHE> wants me to lower this bridge for any purpose other than attacking the enemy... well, you're gonna need to make a damned good argument, let's put it that way.~
@56140 = ~You're <CHARNAME>. THE <CHARNAME>? You know who this is, Mari?~
@56141 = ~ 'Twas <CHARNAME> who b-brought an end to Sarevok's mach-machin-machinations in Baldur's-dur's Gate.~
@56142 = ~Have you taken leave of your senses? I'm not lowering the drawbridge! We'd be slaughtered!~
@56143 = ~I'm not convinced that's true, but I'm not inclined to argue the point at the moment.~
@56144 = ~The commander of the crusade's siege force has promised to let everyone in Bridgefort live if we leave it now.~
@56145 = ~We must attack now if we're to end this siege. Do you want to be cooped up in here for the rest of what I promise you will be your regrettably abbreviated life?~
@56146 = ~I'm the hero of Baldur's Gate. You will do as I say or die by my hand. Lower the damned bridge.~
@56147 = ~You better find some other options, <CHARNAME>. I'm not lowering the bridge on your say-so.~
@56148 = ~The crusade believes Bridgefort is preparing to surrender. If we attack now, they'll be taken by surprise.~
@56149 = ~They're attending some ceremony right now. We'll take them by surprise.~
@56150 = ~Flaming Fist will assist us. They're waiting for signal.~
@56151 = ~Listen to me, damn it! Attacking now is Bridgefort's only chance for victory.~
@56152 = ~Fine. I'll let this go—for now.~
@56153 = ~Lower the bridge, Mari. This m-may be our only chance to win the day.~

@56155 = ~Absolutely.~

@56159 = ~You take your duties very seriously. Good. That's good. I'll leave you to them, for now.~
@56160 = ~Perhaps. Fail to lower it and you will certainly die, I'll see to that.~
@56161 = ~If that's your wish. But I've got a bad feeling about this. Several bad feelings, actually.~
@56162 = ~If you want to attack the crusade, talk to Khalid. He's the one who gives the orders around here. I'll be ready to fight when he gives the word. Now excuse me, I have duties to attend to.~
@56163 = ~Goodbye.~
@56164 = ~And you believed him? They're religious zealots! You think promises they make to us mean anything to them?~
@56165 = ~I believe he is a man of honor, as I am a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of honor. He will fulfill his promises, I am sure of it.~
@56166 = ~You must trust me. This is the only way you'll walk out of Bridgefort alive.~

You are not alone in that. The Flaming Fists also fear what may lie ahead. If Caelar has destroyed Boareskyr Bridge, the expedition will not reach Dragonspear Castle in time to stop the crusade. The forces of Baldur's Gate and its allies will be outmatched. Slaughtered.

These fears grip your allies but also drive them forward. The anxious whispers fall silent when the march is called to a halt less than a day's travel from Boareskyr. The Flaming Fist sets up camp and prepares for the next meeting with the crusade, while you plan your next move.~ [BD56368]

As the march wears on, fatigue grips your company. Tempers flare within the caravan. Your reputation as the hero of Baldur's Gate protects you from petty squabbles and angry outbursts... or perhaps, after what happened on Boareskyr Bridge, there is another reason few are willing to cross you.

These thoughts are put aside when you see the banners of Waterdeep, Daggerford, and the Flaming Fist at the edge of the coalition’s siege camp. Dragonspear Castle is near, and so is Caelar's day of reckoning.~ [BD56371]
@56372 = ~Chapter Ten~
@56373 = ~Steel and magic still clash in the distance, but you have thwarted Caelar's attack upon the siege camp. The time has come for the combined forces of Waterdeep, Daggerford, and Baldur’s Gate to take the battle to the Shining Lady.

The walls surrounding Dragonspear's ruins teem with crusaders. Among them are Caelar’s most trusted lieutenants, men and women of unparalleled skill ready to sacrifice all for their leader. Defeating them and penetrating the castle will not be easy, but that is the task before you.~ [BD56373]

As your watering eyes grow accustomed to the dim lava light of the pit, you begin to feel the oppressive majesty of the blasted waste around you. In pursuing the Shining Lady, you have been brought to the darkest place imaginable, and the pursuit is not yet over. Crusader corpses litter the ground around you, but of Caelar herself, there is no sign.~ [BD56375]

Skie Silvershield lies dead, seemingly at your hand. The siege force's clerics are unable to revive her. Her magically preserved body has been transported to Grand Duke Entar Silvershield, who clings to the faint hope that his daughter might someday be resurrected. You share that hope; without Skie, you may never know the truth of what happened that dark night. 

Once, you thought yourself free of your father's taint. But as you journeyed to Dragonspear Castle, you realized this was not so. You are a child of Bhaal, Lord of Murder. A piece of him resides in you. Has it grown beyond your control? Was yours the hand that plunged the dagger into Skie Silvershield's breast? You do not know. And that fact haunts you.

When you left Baldur's Gate, people cheered you as the city's hero. Now they look upon you and see something very different.~ [BD56378]

I must find Korlasz and deal with her.

I must seek out the wizard Korlasz, last of my half-brother Sarevok's followers, and deliver her to justice. Imoen will follow behind me, protected by the Flaming Fist. A Flaming Fist healer is available to tend to my wounds, and she can instruct me on fighting undead if I require help.~
@56380 = ~Important Events

I must seek out the last of my half-brother Sarevok Anchev's followers, the magician Korlasz, and kill her or deliver her to justice.

She has no stomach for the slaughter I foresee is coming.~

@56387 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

Soon I must join an expedition to Dragonspear Castle to face Caelar's crusade.

The Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate are concerned about the paladin Caelar Argent and her growing army. Waterdeep and Daggerford feel the same, and soldiers from all three cities have been dispatched to confront the Shining Lady at Dragonspear Castle.

I shall join an expedition leaving soon to aid in the war effort. Perhaps at Dragonspear I can learn why the Shining Lady sent assassins after me, and put an end to her and her crusade.~
@56388 = ~Skie's Grand Plan

All I can do is wait for Skie to approach me in private.

I have once again crossed paths with Grand Duke Entar Silvershield's daughter, Skie. She hinted that she has something to tell me, but only if we can meet alone.

Skie has changed little—still bright and adventurous, she lacks maturity and has a remarkable callousness to others' suffering. Perhaps with age she'll gain some perspective.~
@56389 = ~I have met Grant Duke Entar Silvershield's daughter, Skie. She bears little resemblance to her father.~
@56390 = ~Skie's Grand Plan

I can look for Skie at the coalition camp outside Dragonspear Castle.

Grand Duke Entar Silvershield knows of his daughter's plan to join the Flaming Fist caravan heading north in a few hours. He believes the sheltered life she's led thus far has left her ill-equipped for the real world, and hopes a time on the road will toughen her up. Only I and a few others on the journey will know Skie's true identity. Entar insists she be treated as any other member of the Fist.~
@56391 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

Imoen will not join me on the journey north.

I will miss the company of my friend, but she will be safer here in the Grand Dukes' care, especially that of Liia Jannath, who is tutoring her in the ways of magic.~
@56392 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

Imoen refuses to join me in confronting Caelar Argent. 

I've learned that Imoen prefers to remain in Baldur's Gate under the Grand Dukes' protection while she studies the art of magic. So be it. I am better off without her holding me back.~

During her many years as a knight of the Morninglord, Lady Brightsworn had accumulated some wealth, most of which she spent in preparation for her quest. After tracking the vampire to Waterdeep's City of the Dead, she assembled a party of adventurers and led them into the monster's lair. Only one of the group returned. Bloodied and wild-eyed, clutching Lady Brightsworn's helm in his hands, he relayed a tale of the nightmarish warrens the group had found and the vampire who culled them from their group, slaughtering them one by one. Investigations into the City of the Dead uncovered some of the tunnels, but all had collapsed. Of the vampire, there was no trace.

The string was made from silk produced by worms feeding on the bound, living bodies of a dwarven cleric captured by Kirrkuk's tribe. Throughout his life, Kirrkuk used the bow during his shamanic workings. In doing so, his essence was infused into the weapon. Arrows flying from its string seem to seek out gnomes and dwarves, and can, on occasion, afflict their targets with a sickness that weighs their limbs down, making them easier prey for the bow's wielder.

Kruntur prized this armor to such a degree that, upon his death, he refused to leave it. To this day, more than a hundred years later, his spirit still permeates the armor, whispering threats to all who dare wear it and generally making a nuisance of himself. He cannot directly harm the wearer, however, and for a goblinoid, the chance to have such fine protection might well make up for the aggravation the armor brings with it.

@56677 = ~I do as I will. I need no one to "permit" me entry here, or anywhere.~
@56678 = ~I don't approve of those who do Caelar's work for money rather than faith, but I'll not deny a servant of the Shining Lady, regardless of <PRO_HISHER> motivations. Here is what I can offer.~

@56680 = ~I have need of a cleric's skills. Can you help me?~

@56685 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, slayer of Sarevok.~
@56686 = ~Just one of the legion who have come seeking Caelar's light.~

@56689 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate has joined the crusade? This is wonderful! With such a powerful servant as you, Caelar cannot fail! I am Polvi. How can I help you?~
@56690 = ~I am in need of a cleric. Do you offer temple services?~
@56691 = ~It helps me simply to know you are here. I'll leave you now.~

@56694 = ~My mother died when I was a child, leaving me and my sister in my father, Polv's, care. He was a good man, my father. When the devils spilled out of Dragonspear and ravaged the land nearly ten years ago, he was among the first to stand against them. He was also among the first to fall.~
@56695 = ~Lea and I were sent to live with my aunt and uncle. They were poorer than father, but no less noble in spirit. They cared for us as they did their own children. They were slain in the second Dragonspear War. So were Lea, and three of my cousins.~

@56702 = ~The loss of our loved ones is a test the gods have set before us, a test we too often fail. We bow our heads, shed some tears, and shrug our shoulders, accepting what should be unacceptable. The Dragonspear dead were not lost—they were taken. And what was taken once can be taken back.~
@56703 = ~You are as mad as your mistress, priest.~
@56704 = ~An awe-inspiring task. One I'd be better prepared to undertake were my body's strength equal to my spirit's. I need temple services. Can you help me, Polvi?~
@56705 = ~Praise be to Caelar. Thank you for your time and your tale, Polvi. I'll leave you now.~
@56706 = ~And you believe your lunatic Shining Lady is the one to do that taking back? You will never restore the Dragonspear dead, priest. You will join them.~

@56708 = ~I have need of a priest. You offer temple services, do you not?~

@56722 = ~YOUR FACE IS UNBECOMING.~ [BD56722]
@56723 = ~I had little choice but to do what I did. Mystra was... tardy taking me from the Fugue Plane. I'm sure she had her reasons, but that gaping gray void... it gets to you after a while.~ [BD56723]
@56724 = ~Wait! There is something I must tell you before you leave. What was it again...? Death makes the memory a little, what's the word now... fuzzy. Ah, yes, that's right. I was tortured to death. By Red Wizards.~ [BD56724]

@56730 = ~It was a little confusing at first, but I did glean some information whilst various internal organs were being ripped from my, ah, body.~ [BD56730]

@56732 = ~What—? How can you think like that? How does your mind not strangle itself?~
@56733 = ~The Red Wizard's mind is the mightiest of fortresses. Its walls must be strong to contain the limitless power we wield. Now, ghost. Tell me of your death. Spare none of the details, especially the gory ones.~ [BD56733]

@56738 = ~How were you captured?~
@56739 = ~We'll be going now.~
@56740 = ~The Order of Eight Staves, they call themselves. I think... I was mildly eviscerated at the time, which does rather tend to distract.~ [BD56740]
@56741 = ~It happened after I last saw Neera. I teleported from my cave, and—uh, it's a little foggy after that. Might have had something to do with the fog spell. In any event, my attackers' numbers and skill overwhelmed me.~ [BD56741]
@56742 = ~One more second. What makes them more of a threat? I've dealt with Red Wizards before, you know.~ [BD56742]

@56794 = ~I did what seemed best, nothing more.~
@56795 = ~It looks like a newcomer to the camp, an elf named Teleria, lured folk into the woods and petrified them. To what end, I couldn't say. When she saw the refugees return, she fled into the forest. We've not seen her since.~

@56832 = ~Tender of the Dead

I should confront Junia inside the temple at Bridgefort.

I returned the necklace to Tharantis and he was grateful to have a memento of his sister. However that doesn't explain how the necklace got on the murdered corpse in the first place. Sister Junia must know more about this matter. ~
@56833 = ~Anniversary Gift

I should bring Khalid some giant spider silk.

Even in the midst of war, Khalid is thinking about his wife, Jaheira. Their anniversary is coming up and he wants to make her a necklace. He asked me to find him silk from a giant spider. While I admire his devotion, I have to question his timing.~

@56926 = ~There are many who desire my company, but few who deserve it. Still, you are entertaining enough, I suppose. I will join you, for now, at least.~
@56927 = ~You flatter me, my lady. I will come with you. I do enjoy the company of women, though not, I think, to the same degree as you.~
@56928 = ~Better that than boredom. I will come with you. Hopefully, I'll find more excitement at your side than I have here.~

The belief in justice through (benevolent) force, or at least armed vigilance, is the reason for Tyr's existence. Tyr holds great prominence in the pantheon due to his position as leader of the Triad, a trio of lawful good gods that are collectively devoted to the concepts of courage, justice, perseverance, relief of suffering, duty, obedience, honor, and to some extent, righteous martyrdom.

The journey is slowed by the crusade's victims. A multitude of broken, haunted men and women clog the Coast Way. When asked, they speak of fields set aflame, granaries ransacked, and family conscripted by the crusade. Yet many characterize these hardships as necessary sacrifices in pursuit of a greater good. A strange acceptance, even admiration, of Caelar Argent is disconcertingly common in those she has wronged. Some proclaim the Shining Lady a prophet, doing the work of not one but all faiths, all gods.

Is it possible Caelar Argent's cause is a righteous one? Or is she engaged in a great deception to further her own agenda, as Sarevok once did?~ [BD56974]

@57171 = ~Go away. Now.~

A member of the Flaming Fist, Lieutenant Otilda, asked me to pick a fight with a group of mercenary half-orcs. Otilda thinks the half-orcs can't be trusted, and by fighting them, I'll get them banished from camp.~
@57235 = ~The Irregulars

I'll need to report what I know to Otilda.

Kava told me her story. She and Farrl are here to collect some hidden loot they left here months ago. They teamed up with Rend, who really seems to want to kill crusaders. ~
@57236 = ~The Irregulars

Perhaps I should speak to the other half-orcs, or simply pick a fight with them.

Kava tried to get me to insult myself in order to hear her story. I refused on principle, and now she won't speak to me.~
@57237 = ~The Irregulars

I need to find some ale within the crusader camp and bring it back to Kava.

Kava wants me to find her some ale in the crusader camp before she'll tell me her story.~

I should tell Lieutenant Otilda of my success.

I successfully chased the half-orc unit out of the Flaming Fist camp.~
@57239 = ~The Irregulars

I should tell Lieutenant Otilda of my decision.

I learned that the half-orc Rend used to be a crusader. His knowledge could be valuable, so I told him he should stay.~
@57240 = ~The Irregulars

I told Lieutenant Otilda that the half-orcs aren't a threat. 

I believe the lieutenant thinks I made the wrong decision. Still, she asked for my help and this is the course I've chosen.~
@57241 = ~The half-orcs may not be here for the same reasons as everyone else, but they are still good fighters and show no sign that they intend to betray us. I informed Lieutenant Otilda as much, though she seemed unimpressed with my reasoning.~
@57242 = ~The Irregulars

I've finished my dealings with the half-orc irregulars.

I helped the irregulars out, and Kava gave me a small reward as thanks. Even in the middle of war, I'm still attracting misfits and loners to my side.~
@57243 = ~The Irregulars

I received a reward for helping out the half-orcs in camp.~
@57244 = ~The Irregulars

I should tell Lieutenant Otilda of my defeat.

I challenged the half-orcs but was unable to defeat them.~

@57285 = ~I talk to whomever I wish, whenever and wherever I wish, Captain Corwin.~

@57393 = ~Oh. Good. That's good. Well, I'll leave you to it, then. Enjoy the rest of your <DAYNIGHTALL>. ~
@57394 = ~I still don't know how it happened. The dog won every race it was in in the last five tendays. It should have won this one, easily, but—who brings their pet rabbit to a dog race? I mean really!~
@57395 = ~You bet my gold on a dog race? ALL of it? ~
@57396 = ~This is a disaster! You have to get my money back. Now!~
@57397 = ~You realize I'll have to kill you now. You DO understand that, don't you? ~
@57398 = ~In fairness, I also bet all my gold on the race and lost that too.~
@57399 = ~I can get the gold for you soon, very soon, I swear. Please don't tell Duke Belt of this. I'll lose my post. ~
@57400 = ~I won't tell Belt. You'll tell him yourself, immediately. He needs to know what's happening down here.~
@57401 = ~You can get the gold? How long will that take? ~
@57402 = ~You're about to lose much more than that, you cretinous oaf! ~
@57403 = ~Please. Just give me a little time. I'll get it for you. I swear. I'll—I'll go right now and fetch it for you, shall I? Yes. I'll go now. I'll meet you outside the palace with your money before you leave.~
@57404 = ~Oh no, please—please don't make me do that.~
@57405 = ~How long will it take for you to recover what you've lost? ~
@57406 = ~It's the right thing to do, and I expect you to do it.~
@57407 = ~I want my money, Ophyllis. Get it for me. NOW. ~
@57408 = ~All right. I'll tell Duke Belt what I've done. That's fair, really—more than fair. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. You are as merciful as you are wise. Once I've spoken to him, I'll fetch your money and meet you outside the palace. Farewell.~
@57409 = ~Ah! No, no, please! Mercy! ~
@57410 = ~<CHARNAME>. There you are. I'm—I'm glad to see you...~
@57411 = ~Ophyllis? You're bleeding—what happened to you?~
@57412 = ~What is this, Ophyllis? I know you failed to fulfill your duty, but I can't believe Grand Duke Belt would be so cruel in his punishment. ~
@57413 = ~And I'm glad to see you. You have my money, I take it? ~
@57414 = ~That will change rapidly if you haven't brought me my money. ~
@57415 = ~Did—didn't go to Belt. I—I wanted to get your gold back first...~
@57416 = ~I had it, <CHARNAME>... I had your money. ~
@57417 = ~Forget the money, Ophyllis. Who did this to you? ~
@57418 = ~"Had"? I don't like the sound of that. ~
@57419 = ~Excellent. Hand it over. ~
@57420 = ~My tense is making you tense, eh? Heh heh, oh, no laughing—laughing's no good right now. Ribs... Ribs are pretty broken...~
@57421 = ~I had your... had your gold. I said I'd get it, and *cough* I did. But b-before I had a chance to bring it to you, I was attacked—attacked by ruffians.~
@57422 = ~Where did this happen? What can you tell me of these ruffians? ~
@57423 = ~Yes, yes, of course you were. What else was going to happen? ~
@57424 = ~You should have let them kill you, Ophyllis. You would have suffered less at their hands than you will at mine. ~
@57425 = ~They were refugees fleeing the crusade. I heard one... She said they c-could return to the—the Three Old Kegs, now that—oh gods, that hurts, that really, really hurts—now that they had gold to spend.~
@57426 = ~The Three Old Kegs, eh? I'll start there, then. Get in the palace and find a cleric. The streets aren't safe, especially for someone in your current state.~
@57427 = ~Looks like I'll be paying the Three Old Kegs a visit. ~
@57428 = ~You think you hurt now? I'll show you pain such as you've never dreamed, you pilfering wretch! ~
@57429 = ~Mercy... I beg you, <CHARNAME>, mercy. I will repay you. I swear it. Just—just need—just need a little—just need a little more—little more time... Please...~
@57430 = ~You're a kind <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Th-thank you. I will repay you. I s-swear it. Just—just need—just need a little—just need a little more—little more time... And some healing. Excuse me.~
@57431 = ~You—*nngh!*—you need to, to know, <CHARNAME>—I will repay you. I s-swear it. Just need—just need a little more—time... And some healing. Excuse me, please...~
@57432 = ~No! Mercy, I beg you! It's not my fault! It's not my fault! ~
@57433 = ~A toast! A toast, my friends, to Ophyllis, without whose generosity we'd not be here! ~
@57434 = ~Because we'd not have been allowed back in here! ~
@57435 = ~To the generosity of the Grand Dukes' treasurer! ~
@57436 = ~It's been hard tenday upon harder of late for us. But today, at least, we celebrate! ~
@57437 = ~Ho there, stranger! Come and have a drink with us! ~
@57438 = ~Gladly. I could use some good cheer in these dark times. I am <CHARNAME>. ~
@57439 = ~You seem in high spirits this <DAYNIGHTALL>, friends. ~
@57440 = ~I'll not drink with the likes of you. ~
@57441 = ~The choice is yours, friend. Enjoy the rest of your <DAYNIGHTALL>. We certainly intend to. ~
@57442 = ~No! Truly? We drink with the hero of Baldur's Gate? ~
@57443 = ~No hero, me. Just a <PRO_MANWOMAN>, like any other. ~
@57444 = ~You will in a moment. Give me some mead!~
@57445 = ~You talked with <PRO_HIMHER>. But the talk was brief—in fact, it is now over.~
@57446 = ~Well, we'll drink to you all the same. To <CHARNAME>! ~
@57447 = ~Hear, hear! ~
@57448 = ~To the hero of Baldur's Gate! ~
@57449 = ~You've done this city a great service, and we thank you for it. We'll not keep you—enjoy the rest of your <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@57450 = ~Why wouldn't we be? We've a roof over our heads, food and drink—more than we've had since the Shining Lady's bloody crusade drove us from the Troll Claws.~
@57451 = ~You arrived in town recently, then? ~
@57452 = ~Really? To whom do we owe this feast?~
@57453 = ~Tell me, friend. Do you know a man named Ophyllis? A chunky fellow, bit of a halfwit, but a harmless one. ~
@57454 = ~Naw, naw, we been here a tenday or more. ~
@57455 = ~Then how is it you only have food and drink now? ~
@57456 = ~Indeed? Intriguing. Say, I don't suppose you've encountered a fellow named Ophyllis, by any chance? Roly poly, not terribly bright, but a decent man, I think, all things considered. ~
@57457 = ~And it's only this <DAYNIGHTALL> that you have a decent meal? ~
@57458 = ~It's Duke Belt's charity that feeds us, or the charity of his palace's treasurer, anyway. What was his name again? Ophidius? No, Ophyllis, that was it. He was the one that contributed to our merrymaking.~
@57459 = ~It's funny you mention Ophyllis. I encountered him earlier. He did not have the air of one who happily parted with the gold you spend here with such abandon. ~
@57460 = ~He contributed the gold for this banquet? Or had it stolen from him? ~
@57461 = ~The gold was not his to donate, if that is truly what occurred. It was mine, and what is mine is also my god's. Now you must face both our wraths. ~
@57462 = ~The problem is that he contributed MY gold. ~
@57463 = ~Forgive us, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Had we known the gold belonged to any but the Grand Dukes, we'd never have taken—I mean, accepted it. ~
@57464 = ~Return what you have stolen and I'll leave your punishment to your consciences and your gods. ~
@57465 = ~No apologies necessary. Just hand over the gold, and we'll forget this ever happened. ~
@57466 = ~I'm not interested in your excuses. I'm interested in my money. ~
@57467 = ~We don't have the gold. ~
@57468 = ~This banquet you enjoy is certainly impressive, but you could not have spent all my gold on it. ~
@57469 = ~What? You assault an innocent man for money and then you don't even keep your ill-gotten gains?~
@57470 = ~Then you have a problem—a fatal one.~
@57471 = ~Who are you? What do you want with us? ~
@57472 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate. The gold you stole from Ophyllis belonged to me. I would like it back, and I would like justice for the innocent man you beat so viciously.~
@57473 = ~Who am I? They call me <CHARNAME>, among other things: hero of Baldur's Gate, slayer of Sarevok, destroyer of the Iron Throne. I want the money you took from Ophyllis. MY money.~
@57474 = ~I am the <PRO_MANWOMAN> who will see every last one of you lie dead at my feet unless the gold you stole is returned to me immediately. ~
@57475 = ~All of our wraths! Boo will not abide injustice. Nor will I.~ [BD57475]
@57476 = ~The journey to Baldur's Gate was long and hard, and our time here has been no easier. We're skin and bones. This is the first decent meal we've had in two months or more. ~
@57477 = ~Our story is hardly unique, I know. Thousands who fled the crusade huddle in the streets of this city, cold, hungry, and alone. We took the treasurer's gold not just to help ourselves, but others who share in our plight.~
@57478 = ~You gave the rest of the gold to those who needed it. ~
@57479 = ~You're missing the point, friend. It wasn't Ophyllis's gold you took. It was mine, and I need it now. ~
@57480 = ~The only plight that matters is my own. If you cannot give me my money, I'll take what satisfaction I can from painting this bar red with your blood! ~
@57481 = ~Your gold saved many lives. If that offers you no satisfaction, if we must be punished for that, so be it. I'll die gladly, knowing I did so in service to the greater good.~
@57482 = ~To those who desperately needed it. That gold saved many lives, or at least prolonged them a time. If we must be punished for that, so be it. I'll die gladly, knowing I did so in service to a higher cause. ~
@57483 = ~You need it more than the mothers and children starving on the streets? No. You want it, and that's fair enough, I understand that. But that gold saved many lives, or at least prolonged them a time. If we must be punished for that, so be it. I'll die gladly, knowing I did so in service to a higher cause. ~
@57484 = ~A tale of bleak despair that would touch even the most callous of hearts. Someone wake me when it's over.~ [BD57484]
@57485 = ~And if we're not killed, a cell in the Flaming Fist will at least offer a roof over our head and a meal a day. That's more than many have right now.~
@57486 = ~You did what you thought right. I cannot bring myself to judge you harshly for it. Enjoy your food and your drink, and think well of me in the days to come. Fare as well as circumstances allow. ~
@57487 = ~Your heart might have been in the right place, but what about Ophyllis? You beat the man within an inch of his life. I can't allow thievery and assault to go on unchallenged in the city. Go downstairs and turn yourself in to Captain Corwin of the Flaming Fist.~
@57488 = ~You'll not see a cell. All that awaits you is a pauper's grave. ~
@57489 = ~Has Caelar not beaten these people down enough already, <CHARNAME>? Their crime was great, I admit, but does it truly merit such a punishment?~ [BD57489]
@57490 = ~I'm sorry for your friend Ophyllis, and I'm sorry we took your gold. Truly. But I can't say I wouldn't do it again. ~
@57491 = ~Count yourself lucky for Dynaheir's words of wisdom and restraint. They have saved your lives. Farewell. ~
@57492 = ~Were I in your boots, there's every chance I'd have done the same thing. But I'm in my boots, and those boots are going to kick your arse. ~
@57493 = ~You'll not have the chance to do it again, dead man. ~
@57494 = ~You're a good <PRO_MANWOMAN>—a charitable heart like your own is hard to come by of late. I thank you—we all do. You'll be in our thoughts and prayers.~
@57495 = ~Here, take this, please. It is the axe my husband used to fight the crusade before he—he— The road was not kind to him. He did not finish the journey here. I kept the axe, but you'll surely have more use for it than I will.~
@57496 = ~Again, our thanks. Farewell. ~
@57497 = ~I hoped it wouldn't come to this. We've fought hard, scratched tooth and nail to make it this far. We'll not stop now!~
@57498 = ~Ho, there! Oh, thank the gods, I thought I'd never catch up to you. ~
@57499 = ~Ophyllis? What are you doing here? ~
@57500 = ~And you were wrong. What a shocking turn of events that is. ~
@57501 = ~You never struck me as being suicidal. I assume you're here with my money. ~
@57502 = ~Making good on my debt to you. ~
@57503 = ~I appreciate the effort, my friend, but you shouldn't have made it. I've gotten by without the gold you lost. ~
@57504 = ~You have my gold? ~
@57505 = ~You may have just saved your life, Ophyllis. Give me the gold. ~
@57506 = ~But I did lose it, and that haunts me, <CHARNAME>. It haunts me. I will see you repaid, I swear it. And today is the first step on the path that will see what is rightfully yours returned. ~
@57507 = ~If you've got their gold, stop yammering and hand it over.~ [BD57507]
@57508 = ~Well, I put the word out I was looking for gold and a fairly large quantity of it, but actual coins are hard to come by. An artisan named Foxleigh did have this, though. ~
@57509 = ~Is that—is that a bust of the hero, cast in gold?~ [BD57509]
@57510 = ~Well, I'm TRYING to make good on my debt to you. I have some gold—not all that I owe you, not yet, but I will get it, I swear.~
@57511 = ~Calm yourself, Ophyllis. I'm happy to get any of the gold you lost returned, no matter how insignificant the amount. I appreciate the effort you've made, coming all this way. Sincerely. ~
@57512 = ~Every little bit counts. How did you come into possession of this gold? Nothing too nefarious, I hope, though not enough to care if nefariousness was indeed involved. ~
@57513 = ~I'll take every gold piece I can get my hands on. Give it to me now. ~
@57514 = ~Yes, well, it is rather a large piece of gold. I tried to find someone who'd offer me a fair exchange in common currency, but no luck. I could have had it melted down, but that would have taken I don't know how long. ~
@57515 = ~Had it melted down? Had what melted down? I don't understand. ~
@57516 = ~So what you have to give me isn't common currency? What is it, then? ~
@57517 = ~Get to the point, Ophyllis, or I'll find a sword to get to it for you. ~
@57518 = ~Well, as I say, I put the word out I was looking for gold and a fairly large quantity of it, and actual coins are hard to come by, for obvious reasons, but an artisan by the name of Foxleigh was willing to offer me this. ~
@57519 = ~And what is this precisely? ~
@57520 = ~This is a bust of me. ~
@57521 = ~I know little of the arts, but I know what I like. As a rule, I do like my face. But my face doesn't usually have the seam of a mold running down the middle of its nose, as this bust does. ~
@57522 = ~You'd better go now, Ophyllis.~
@57523 = ~A GOLD bust of you. Nice, eh? Foxleigh's made a small fortune selling them to merchants and nobles put out by the Iron Throne—between you and me, those have more than a little brass and copper mixed in, but this one—pure gold. And it's yours.~
@57524 = ~I appreciate the effort you've made, Ophyllis. Consider your debt to me repaid. ~
@57525 = ~What in the Nine Hells am I supposed to do with a gold bust of myself? ~
@57526 = ~You'd better leave now, Ophyllis.~
@57527 = ~Well—it's gold, right? And I lost a fair amount of your gold, so I thought this would, you know, go some way towards making up for that.~
@57528 = ~I love it, Ophyllis. This is worth more to me than any mere gold coins ever could be. Consider your debt paid, my friend. ~
@57529 = ~This should cover the interest on your debt. Now get out of my sight and don't return to it until you've got my fortune, in a form more useful than this wretched hunk of metal! ~
@57530 = ~GO NOW, OPHYLLIS. ~
@57531 = ~You seem upset. Are you upset? I thought this, well, I know it's not ideal, but it is gold, after all, and—I'm going now. I'll just go. By the time you return to Baldur's Gate, I'll have your money, I swear. I promise. Farewell. Uh. Yes. So that's that.~
@57532 = ~Oh no, no, no. Can't do that. I failed you, and I failed Grand Duke Belt. I'll not rest until I've corrected my mistake, you have my word on that. I'll go now. ~
@57533 = ~By the time you return to Baldur's Gate, I'll have your money, if not before. You can take that to the bank, which now that I think of it would probably have been a better idea than leaving it with me... So yes. Going now. Farewell.~
@57534 = ~Agh! No, please, I'm trying to repay you, I swear! Please, just give me a chance. PLEASE! ~
@57535 = ~<CHARNAME>! Over—ungh—over here. It's m-me, Ophyllis...~
@57536 = ~Ahhh... Oh, ow. Ow, ow, ow, that—that really hurts... ~
@57537 = ~Well, you've—ahn!—you've really gone and done it this time, Ophyllis... ~
@57538 = ~Mummy? Is... Is that you? Wait, you're—ahh!—you're not my mum. You're a tent.~
@57539 = ~Oh, thank the—thank the gods, I found you. I... I don't think I've m-much time left in this—this world...~
@57540 = ~Don't move, Ophyllis. You need healing. ~
@57541 = ~You're probably right about that. You've got a sword in your chest. ~
@57542 = ~Why are you here, Ophyllis? Do you have my gold? ~
@57543 = ~Some chests do fine having swords in them, but I'm—I'm afraid mine isn't one of them. Heh heh hehhhoh—no, no, no—that hurts—that's not good at all... But tha-that's not why I'm here...~
@57544 = ~I had it, <CHARNAME>. I had your money, all of it. But I was caught—caught in the crusade's attack. They took the gold, all of it...~
@57545 = ~All I h-have to give you—ngh!—is th-this sword I got f-from my attack-my attackers...~
@57546 = ~That doesn't matter right now. We need to find someone to heal you. ~
@57547 = ~Hang on, Ophyllis. I have a potion that will help you. ~
@57548 = ~Don't worry about that. Be still; let me heal you. ~
@57549 = ~There are more important things in this world than possessions, Ophyllis. Now be still. We can heal you. ~
@57550 = ~You mean the sword in your chest? Uh, I think it'd better stay where it is until we can get you some healing. ~
@57551 = ~I'd have preferred my gold, but I'll take what I can get. ~
@57552 = ~Too—too late for healing. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, I tried, b-but if you want your gold, you'll naAHH!-need to find the c-crusaders who took it. Here now...~
@57553 = ~AAAAGH! ~
@57554 = ~The sword is yours... M-may the gods smile upon you, O hero of Baldur's Gate... Uhhh...~
@57555 = ~Well. That was... really quite impressive, in its own way.~ [BD57555]
@57556 = ~I'll not waste my energy on this idiot. He is beyond my help—his fate is in the gods' hands now.~ [BD57556]
@57557 = ~How 'bout the fancy lady with the orbs goin' 'round her head? ~
@57558 = ~Nah. She's got a knife in 'er boot. ~
@57559 = ~Let's roll that lout with the glowin' staff! ~
@57560 = ~Yeah, I like the look of him! ~
@57561 = ~Roll a wizard? You WANT to get fried? Pass. ~
@57562 = ~Them two in the armor with the fancy stitching don't look so tough. ~
@57563 = ~Let's see if they come 'round again. ~
@57564 = ~Oh, how 'bout them with the sparkly cloaks? Look like bards or somesuch. ~
@57565 = ~You dolt, those are just cheap costumes. ~
@57566 = ~Yeah, we wanna roll someone with lots o' gold! ~
@57567 = ~No rush. We just gotta take our time... pick the perfect target.~
@57568 = ~Whatcha want, ugly? ~
@57569 = ~You'll keep movin' if you know what's good for ya. ~
@57570 = ~Looking to lighten your purse, chum? ~
@57571 = ~Well, well, whadda we got here? ~
@57572 = ~Some call me the hero of Baldur's Gate. ~
@57573 = ~Just a concerned citizen. ~
@57574 = ~Someone who's about to rain pain like you've never known before down on you and your sorry crew. ~
@57575 = ~Is that right? Well, maybe you should just shove off 'fore ya get hurt. ~
@57576 = ~And leave you to your larceny? I overheard you—I know you're searching for a target to rob.~
@57577 = ~Sound advice. I'll be on my way, then. ~
@57578 = ~I'm not the one who's going to be hurt here. ~
@57579 = ~And...? You offering yourself as a pick? Now that I think of it, you got the look of someone with a bit o' coin in your pocket. ~
@57580 = ~It's a bit late for that, friend. You have the look of someone with a bit o' coin in your pocket. ~
@57581 = ~Oh, aye? We'll see about that. You look like someone with a bit o' coin to your name. ~
@57582 = ~Hehe, that's right. You tell 'em, Lluis! ~
@57583 = ~How 'bout you hand over every copper you have and maybe we'll let you go? ~
@57584 = ~Are you so blind you can't see a skilled warrior when <PRO_HESHE> stands before you? Think twice before challenging me. You wouldn't be the first band of thugs I've taken down. ~
@57585 = ~My kind isn't known for its patience—or its weakness. Begone, unless you'd have me tear you all to bloody shreds. ~
@57586 = ~You're thugs and bullies. You'll not get a single coin from me. ~
@57587 = ~I don't want any trouble. Here, take all my money. ~
@57588 = ~How about YOU give ME all your gold and maybe I'll let you go? ~
@57589 = ~H-hey now, we were just joking around. Right, guys?~
@57590 = ~Get ahold of yourself, Asery, you coward. ~
@57591 = ~I j-just remembered I left my front door unlocked. Bye. ~
@57592 = ~Even one person down, we can take <PRO_HIMHER>. Get <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@57593 = ~We were hoping you'd say that. ~
@57594 = ~Get <PRO_HIMHER>! ~
@57595 = ~We'll take it from your body, along with everything else you've got—get <PRO_HIMHER>! ~
@57596 = ~I don't think you quite understand the way this works, friend. ~
@57597 = ~Welcome to the Three Old Kegs! Step through this door and experience one of the finest inns Baldur's Gate has to offer! ~
@57598 = ~You must be drumming up quite a bit of business. ~
@57599 = ~Do you have to stand outside and shout all day? ~
@57600 = ~Thank you. ~
@57601 = ~Oh yes. The streets are packed with refugees looking for lodging. The Iron Throne building offers temporary shelter to those who can't afford rooms for themselves. I'm here to let those that can know the Three Old Kegs offers excellent quality at a fair price!~
@57602 = ~This "crusade" may be bad for the Sword Coast, but it's been a blessing for us. The work does get a bit tiring, though. I wonder if I could ask you a favor?~
@57603 = ~What is it? ~
@57604 = ~You can ask, but I make no promises. ~
@57605 = ~Don't. ~
@57606 = ~I've been shouting out here for hours—my voice is starting to go. If you're going inside, would you ask Katheera to send a drink out for me? ~

@57608 = ~What's in it for me? ~
@57609 = ~I'm not interested. ~
@57610 = ~My thanks? You don't really expect payment for a few seconds' work? ~
@57611 = ~Of course not. I'll talk to this Katheera presently. ~
@57612 = ~I make it a habit to hope for the best but expect the worst. I'll speak to this serving wench for you. ~
@57613 = ~You expect someone to help you free of charge? ~
@57614 = ~Thank you! She's inside somewhere, usually the main floor, I think. I must return to work now.~
@57615 = ~I see. I'll not trouble you further, then. ~

@57617 = ~Robel, the crier working outside, is losing his voice. He could use a drink. ~
@57618 = ~Mercy, we barely have drink enough to satisfy paying customers. I'll send one out when I can, but it may be a while.~
@57619 = ~Surely a lady of your competence and composure can find a way to send the drink out sooner than later? The other servers must look up to such a woman as yourself. Think how it'll look to let another employee of the Three Old Kegs go thirsty. ~
@57620 = ~I'm a hearty individual with an ox's stamina, but even I would find Robel's task trying. Are you sure you can't find a way to send the drink out more quickly?~
@57621 = ~Robel's working so hard to bring customers in. I'm sure you and the other servers have benefited from the extra hours and the tips. The least you could do is get him a hot drink. ~
@57622 = ~I'll let him know a drink is coming eventually, then. ~
@57623 = ~Well, I tried. Robel will have to make do as best he can. ~
@57624 = ~All right, all right, you've convinced me. I'll have the kitchen mix some hot lemon water with a bit of rum and honey and send it out right away. ~
@57625 = ~I know a thing or two about herbal remedies. If you add a bit of ground-up slippery elm bark or sage, the drink will be all the more soothing.~
@57626 = ~Thank you. I'm sure Robel will appreciate it. ~
@57627 = ~Fancy that! The servers often have sore throats by shift's end. I'll pass that on to the others. Much obliged! ~
@57628 = ~Tell him I won't forget. We're just terribly busy right now. I'll have the kitchen mix up some hot lemon water with rum and honey soon as I'm able.~
@57629 = ~I know something about healing herbs. If you add a bit of slippery elm bark or sage, the drink will be all the more soothing. ~
@57630 = ~I'm sure he'll appreciate that. ~
@57631 = ~Well, back to work. Enjoy your stay at the Three Old Kegs. ~
@57632 = ~Bloody hells, I'm parched! Any word on that drink? ~
@57633 = ~Katheera will send one out right away. ~
@57634 = ~Katheera's going to send one out as soon as she can, but it may be a while. They're very busy inside. ~
@57635 = ~Not yet. ~
@57636 = ~Let me know when you've talked to Katheera. ~
@57637 = ~Thanks for the help—I appreciate it. Here, take a few coins for your troubles. ~
@57638 = ~Huh. Perhaps I'm doing my job too well. Thank you for your help; I do appreciate it.~
@57639 = ~Now I must return to work. Enjoy your <DAYNIGHTALL>! ~
@57640 = ~Come on in, folks, come in and slake your thirst at the Three Old Kegs! ~
@57641 = ~We've Luskan ale, Calimshite brandy, and an orcish brew that'll knock your teeth out! ~
@57642 = ~The crowds keep pouring in! Thanks again for getting me that drink. ~
@57643 = ~Ah, gods, why? Why? What am I going to do? ~
@57644 = ~I've raised the money you need. 15 gold. Go, bury your cousin. ~
@57645 = ~What's going on here? Is that man dead? ~
@57646 = ~Excuse me, my lady—are you all right? I mean, obviously not, but is there anything I can do to help you, or that gentleman? Is he dead?~
@57647 = ~This looks like trouble, and I've enough of that in my life. May your fortune turn in future. Farewell. ~
@57648 = ~He is my cousin, a refugee. He came to the city to stay with me, but caught a fever on the road. H-he was so sick when he arrived... He lived only a few hours before he die—before he passed. ~
@57649 = ~I am truly sorry for your loss. ~
@57650 = ~A sad tale to be sure. Er, could you tell me why he's lying in that cart? ~
@57651 = ~Your tale is tragic, but hardly unique. These are hard times. I'll leave you to mourn your loss. ~
@57652 = ~I b-brought him to the temple, but a burial costs 100 gold. I'm 15 gold short. I don't want my cousin buried in a nameless pauper's grave—is there anything you can do to help me?~
@57653 = ~15 gold is all you need? Here, take it—may it ease your grief in this trying period. ~
@57654 = ~That's not so much money. I'll see if I can raise 15 gold and return to you in due course. ~
@57655 = ~100 gold for a burial? I'm a cleric myself, and I can tell you that's far too expensive. Which temple did you visit? I'll be having a word with its priest... ~
@57656 = ~I've heard that you can get a corpse taken care of discreetly at the Three Old Kegs for 100 gold. Quite a coincidence, isn't it? ~
@57657 = ~It seems strange that a temple would charge so much. Which temple did you visit? I'd like to have a word with its administrators. ~
@57658 = ~Your story rings false, woman. You seem more agitated than grief-stricken. What's really going on here? ~
@57659 = ~Nothing I care to do. Farewell. ~
@57660 = ~Oh, thank you! You are truly sent by the gods. I'm going back to the temple right away! ~
@57661 = ~That takes a great weight from my mind. Thank you. ~
@57662 = ~Begone, then. ~
@57663 = ~All right, this clearly isn't going to work. I might as well tell you the truth. The man in the cart is my late husband. He was a drunken brute. Life with him was a nightmare. ~
@57664 = ~We fought—I tried to run. He came after me and slipped, hitting his head on the hearth. You see the result before you. I'd heard 100 gold could get a body taken care of at the Three Old Kegs. With the Fist distracted by the refugees, I thought I might get away with it.~
@57665 = ~Your lot has been difficult, but you do yourself no favors in trying to hide your crime, if a crime it truly was.~
@57666 = ~That sounds a bit more credible. I'm still not sure I believe you, though. ~
@57667 = ~Sounds like good riddance to me. Good luck taking out this trash. I won't interfere or tell the guards.~
@57668 = ~Please don't report me! If one of the Flaming Fist's officers heard my story, they'd arrest me for sure. Just leave me in peace, please.~
@57669 = ~You deserve to be rid of this violent man. Here, take this: 15 gold. Dispose of his body and speak to no one else of this matter. ~
@57670 = ~No one should be treated as you were. I'll not say anything to the Fist. ~
@57671 = ~I won't say anything to the Fist—for a price. ~
@57672 = ~I make no promises. I'm leaving now. ~
@57673 = ~Oh, thank you, thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. You've made a wretched life brighter this <DAYNIGHTALL>. I'll never forget this kindness. Farewell. ~
@57674 = ~W-what? But I can't—I can't! Oh... very well. Here, take it. 85 gold, it's all I have. Would that I'd never crossed your path. Now I'll have to start over. Begone; I want nothing more to do with you. ~
@57675 = ~Don't turn me in, I beg you! I am at your mercy. I know you'll do the right thing. ~
@57676 = ~Unless you have business with the Fist, I'll have to ask you to move on. ~
@57677 = ~I want to talk to you about a man named Garachen. He owns a home by the Ducal Palace. ~
@57678 = ~Is murder Flaming Fist business? ~
@57679 = ~I'll just be moving along, then. A good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you, officer. ~
@57680 = ~A murder? Tell me more. ~
@57681 = ~A woman in the alley behind the Three Old Kegs murdered her husband. She has his body in a cart. ~
@57682 = ~These crowds are killing me. I tell you, the stench of their bodies all pressed together, it's murder, am I right? ~
@57683 = ~I need tell you nothing. This is Baldur's Gate—just look around. You'll see evidence of the crime all about you. Impossible to miss. ~
@57684 = ~You may think murder is a joke, but I'm not laughing. Be on your way. ~
@57685 = ~What? Unbelievable. Actually, on reflection it isn't, really, and that's a sad state of affairs. I'll send officers there to arrest her immediately. Thank you, citizen. Take this small reward for supporting the city in this time of crisis. ~
@57686 = ~Come with us, ma'am. ~
@57687 = ~No, you don't understand! It was an accident! ~
@57688 = ~Yeah, yeah. Tell it to the magistrate. ~

I should pass by the dragon into the room beyond and try to find whoever controls it.

A ghost dragon stands guard over the entrance to a place called Kanaglym. It attempted to frighten me off, but was unwilling to take direct action against me. It is bound by some external power, forced to act in a manner not its choosing. Perhaps I can free it from this bondage.~

@57707 = ~Well, it certainly took you long enough. I suppose you'll want to go over the plan AGAIN now.~

@57709 = ~I'll stay here with the Flaming Fist and make sure no one escapes while you take care of the mage.~
@57710 = ~You have a way with the ladies, Montaron.~
@57711 = ~Aye. And crocodiles have a way with chickens. If we're to do this, let's waste no more time with talk.~
@57712 = ~I swear on my honor, this Korlasz will not escape justice.~
@57713 = ~On your honor? Let's make it interesting, Ajantis. This dwarf has 20 gold that says she does escape justice.~
@57714 = ~Put the purse away, Kagain. Ye bet against the success of your own party, ye bloody fool! What kinda thinkin's that? I'll tell ye, no thinking' at all. Now let's do what we came here t'do, or go somewhere and do somethin' else.~
@57715 = ~You're standin' right there. Don't tell me you were meant to be hiding, now?~
@57716 = ~That wasn't so bad, but it wasn't that good, either. I'll be happy to be out of this place.~
@57717 = ~Our cause is just. Helm watches over us.~
@57718 = ~The mage cannot be so foolish as to believe these sellswords would stay our progress.~
@57719 = ~A good start to some bad business.~
@57720 = ~I've lived in worse places than this, but never happily.~
@57721 = ~This place makes me uneasy. For the dead to reside in such rotted splendor... It goes against nature.~
@57722 = ~I hope we face better opposition than this. I'm not above... enhancing certain events for the sake of drama, but I hate to make stories up out of whole cloth.~
@57723 = ~That's what ye get, ye bloody great lumbering oxes! How'd ye like it?~
@57724 = ~Those guards are just the beginning. I can feel it.~
@57725 = ~Live like a rat long enough, sooner or later you're gonna die like one.~
@57726 = ~That's great. That's just fantastic. And here I thought we might make it an hour without senseless bloodshed. But no, no, here it comes, right on senseless schedule.~

@57732 = ~Is that it? I've better things to do with my time than freeze me arse off in some dank, smelly hole.~
@57733 = ~This place is really starting to keep on making me anxious since the moment we got here. How much longer will this take?~
@57734 = ~Thank you, Helm, for the strength you provide me in this dank pit.~
@57735 = ~These guards fought well, but not quite well enough.~
@57736 = ~Wrong night to guard a servant of Sarevok. Better luck in your next life.~
@57737 = ~This is no fit place for a Red Wizard of my stature. How much longer must we remain in this fetid house of the dead?~
@57738 = ~Pick the guards' pockets clean. They'll have little enough use for gold now.~

@57745 = ~There's more blood to be shed. Let's be about our business.~
@57746 = ~Are we almost finished down here? The smell is giving me a headache.~
@57747 = ~And so fall all who stand against the might of Cyric and his chosen instrument, the mighty Tiax! Fear the Dark Sun! HAHAHAHAH!~
@57748 = ~These dead come pre-entombed. Convenient.~
@57749 = ~Now this is my kind of crypt—one that's filled with the corpses of my enemies.~
@57750 = ~I'll tell ye this for nothing: All this bloodshed's givin' me a mighty thirst, and may Clangeddin himself strike me down if I be lyin'.~
@57751 = ~And Tiax is Tiax, who seeks his destiny, to be master over all!~
@57752 = ~Still your tongue, you babbling nirgon!~
@57753 = ~The wise <PRO_MANWOMAN> who knows when to stop pushing <PRO_HISHER> luck, <CHARNAME>...~

@57756 = ~Silence! I must have silence!~
@57757 = ~Oh, no, there is still so very much that can be destroyed. Come! I will show you!~
@57758 = ~You are being offered a gift, Korlasz. You would be wise to take it.~
@57759 = ~She's defenseless without her staff. We kill her now, right?~
@57760 = ~Peace, my diminutive friend. She is no longer a threat to us.~
@57761 = ~She's a bigger threat to us now than she would be dead...~
@57762 = ~See that you do not get "distracted" along the way, mage. If I must hunt you down a second time, it will be the last. Be off with you.~
@57763 = ~In my experience, one cannot ask for a better time to strike.~
@57764 = ~Tempus, guide us to victory!~
@57765 = ~That really rather depends on the crypt you're rotting in...~
@57766 = ~Where there is life there is hope, Korlasz. Take the opportunity the gods have given you to reflect and seek redemption for your crimes.~
@57767 = ~Oohhh, this look interesting.~
@57768 = ~Careful, <CHARNAME>. Though Korlasz be dealt with, there may yet be danger here.~
@57769 = ~This place seems to have no end, other than the obvious one—which I would rather avoid.~
@57770 = ~A hidden chamber? My second-favorite kind.~
@57771 = ~This looks promising.~
@57772 = ~The shadows are dark—darker than they should be. Be careful.~
@57773 = ~I've enjoyed many a night in a hidden room before, but I can't imagine why one would need one after they're dead.~
@57774 = ~A hidden compartment usually means hidden traps. Watch your step.~
@57775 = ~Grab what's good for gettin' an' let's begone afore this blasted damp make me unpleasant.~
@57776 = ~Really? The crypt chambers we found were insufficient? You HAD to go looking for more?~
@57777 = ~Anything in here gives me trouble, I'll kill it. It if it's already dead, I'll kill it again.~
@57778 = ~Ew. I got cobwebs in my hair!~
@57779 = ~This is what Tiax calls interesting. Let's see how interesting it is...~
@57780 = ~Those who hide such a chamber would not stop there to ensure it went undefiled. A wise <PRO_MANWOMAN> would leave well enough alone. Let us leave now, while we're still able.~
@57781 = ~The stench of ancient death fills the air. I LIKE it!~
@57782 = ~Nothin' a dwarf likes better than a hidden compartment. That's where you put the good stuff!~
@57783 = ~Not quite yet. I want to make sure there's nothing I've missed.~
@57784 = ~We wouldn't want that. I'll await you here.~
@57785 = ~Something smells funny here... <CHARNAME>, beware! That's not Imoen!~
@57786 = ~Beware! Something is not right here!~
@57787 = ~You should have turned your back on me—easier for us all if you had. Korlasz, slay them!~
@57788 = ~It's possible because it was no child. It was the doppelganger we faced a few minutes ago, OBVIOUSLY.~
@57789 = ~There IS a way, an obvious way for anyone who takes a moment to think. Clearly, this "child" was the doppelganger we faced scant minutes ago. I swear, you lot grow more witless with every passing second.~
@57790 = ~Korlasz is dead. We did what we came to do.~
@57791 = ~Let's see what the mage thinks. Hey, Korlasz! Am I finished here?~
@57792 = ~Ye've barely wounded her at all. Let me put her to the blade and have done with it.~
@57793 = ~I'm with you, pot. That kettle really is quite black.~
@57794 = ~You should smile more, Korlasz. It might make you feel better. Even if it doesn't, it can't hurt, can it?~
@57795 = ~You know <PRO_HESHE>'s right. I've seen broken people, some of my best friends are in bits and bloody pieces, and you're not like them at all. Yet.~
@57796 = ~A situation the Grand Dukes shall doubtlessly rectify sooner than later.~
@57797 = ~So you tell yourself. But in the grander scheme of things there is little that truly must be done. Take the oak, for instance. It does little, it simply is, and simply by being it serves its purpose. You are never satisfied simply to be, <CHARNAME>. No, you must always be doing.~
@57798 = ~I'm surprised you put up with me as long as you did. Take care, Edwin.~

We have stifled these slanders... so far. In times such as these, it is very easy for a hero to become a villain, no?~

@57943 = ~Th-that is excellent news. We are almost at the end of our r-resources, and your help will be invaluable. L-let me tell you what's happened.~ [BD57943]
@57944 = ~Jaheira and I came north to find a p-peaceful place to spend time together. When the crusaders hit Bridgefort, we were separated. Since I have the most experience, I took command here.~ [BD57944]
@57945 = ~Khalid, I know that you and Jaheira are Harpers. Do you really expect me to believe you're here by coincidence?~
@57946 = ~And you were trapped inside?~
@57947 = ~That must have been hard for you two.~
@57948 = ~It's too bad there wasn't a real general here when the siege started.~
@57949 = ~I, uh, I d-don't know what you mean. We were just looking for a p-picnic spot...~ [BD57949]
@57950 = ~B-blast, I can't lie to you. The Harpers had word that the crusade m-might be heading this way. They s-sent us here to intercept the crusade and delay them until the Flaming Fist arrived.~ [BD57950]
@57951 = ~Ind-deed. I found myself at the helm of a fast-sinking ship, if you know what I mean. We were instantly besieged and t-trapped inside. The crusaders seek the supplies we hold here.~ [BD57951]
@57952 = ~Our situation is this: At the front d-doors, we have scores of crusaders who have barricaded the b-bridge. They call their leader the Barghest.~ [BD57952]

@57954 = ~With the Flaming Fist company you brought, we might stand a chance in a direct fight.~ [BD57954]
@57955 = ~Very well. I will bring the Fists from the east. Your forces will strike from the north. We'll crush the camp between us, then proceed across Boareskyr Bridge.~
@57956 = ~The crusade wants the keep's supplies? Why not hand them over?~
@57957 = ~Perhaps. Let me consider this.~
@57958 = ~You're the commander, aren't you? Command, then. Make a decision.~
@57959 = ~Have a care how you speak. It is a miracle that Khalid has held the fort. Lesser men would have lost it days ago.~

@57961 = ~A coward's solution, you mean.~ [BD57961]

@57963 = ~S-start with the wizard Wynan Hess. You should find him in the rear of the f-f-fort. He knows the state of our defenses. Also, talk to Jegg Hillcarver, our smith. She can tell you about our s-supplies.~ [BD57963]
@57964 = ~I'll seek out Hess and Hillcarver immediately.~
@57965 = ~I'll speak to Hess and Hillcarver eventually, but I also wish to scout out the crusader camp.~
@57966 = ~If you can't make a decision without me, I suppose I'll have to figure out the best way to handle this mess.~
@57967 = ~Th-thank you, <CHARNAME>. Fate has smiled on us by sending you here.~ [BD57967]
@57968 = ~You can leave the fort the same way you entered, but beware of crusade patrols. If you sneak into the crusader camp, k-k-keep a low profile and don't use your r-real name. You could trigger a w-war.~ [BD57968]
@57969 = ~I would be remiss in commanding without the input of someone as experienced as yourself. Do as you wish, <CHARNAME>, but hurry.~ [BD57969]
@57970 = ~You should speak to Wynan Hess and Jegg Hillcarver inside the f-fort. I'm glad you're here to h-help us.~
@57971 = ~My friend, you return.~ [BD57971]
@57972 = ~I've considered our course of action, Khalid. I know how we should deal with the crusade.~
@57973 = ~I need to talk to you about the spellstone poisoning the keep.~
@57974 = ~You seem anxious, Khalid. Is there something you wanted to ask me?~
@57975 = ~I found the spider's silk you were looking for, Khalid.~
@57976 = ~I wanted to check in with you while I continue evaluating our options.~
@57977 = ~I think I need more time to think. We'll talk later.~
@57978 = ~We continue to hold the crusade at bay, but we're running out of time. Press on, my friend.~
@57979 = ~Farewell.~
@57980 = ~What have you decided?~
@57981 = ~The longer we wait, the more likely it is the crusade will receive reinforcements. It's time to take the battle to our enemy.~
@57982 = ~I've evaluated our enemy and believe we can come to terms with them. I recommend you join me; we'll go to the drawbridge to negotiate a surrender.~
@57983 = ~I'm going to see if I can negotiate the fort's peaceful surrender. I'll be alone on the drawbridge, but ready your people in case things turn sour.~
@57984 = ~Yes! The time to fight is now, and the time to celebrate is after the time to fight!~ [BD57984]
@57985 = ~Are you s-sure? Now is the time to attack the crusade?~
@57986 = ~Yes, right now. The Flaming Fist are prepared to join us.~
@57987 = ~I go to alert the Flaming Fist camp. If you hear sounds of combat, join in the battle.~
@57988 = ~I need to prepare myself first. Wait a moment and I'll return when it's time to start the attack.~
@57989 = ~Actually, there's more to be done before we attack. Wait a bit longer.~
@57990 = ~V-victory is at hand! To arms, defenders of Bridgefort!~ [BD57990]
@57991 = ~To solve a problem with words requires more skill than solving a problem with fists.~ [BD57991]
@57992 = ~I-if you're s-sure, then. Once we begin negotiating, we will have to carry the matter through to the end. Is this the right time?~
@57993 = ~Yes. Let's begin the negotiations.~
@57994 = ~I'll need some time to prepare myself. I'll return when I'm ready.~
@57995 = ~Actually, there's more to be done before we negotiate. Bide a time.~
@57996 = ~A s-sensible solution. As you wish. I'll have one of the s-soldiers call out that we wish to surrender.~ [BD57996]
@57997 = ~We will be ready. I'll have one of the soldiers call out that we w-wish to surrender. Good luck, my f-friend.~ [BD57997]
@57998 = ~I-if you're s-sure. Once you begin negotiating, you'll have to carry the matter through to the end. Is this the right time?~

@58003 = ~Very well then. Go.~
@58004 = ~Oh, did you get the impression I was going to let you go? No, no, that's not going to happen. You have my sincere apologies for the misunderstanding.~
@58005 = ~Stay in the cell, monster. Rot in it till the end of your days.~
@58006 = ~Perhaps I shall—but my kind is long-lived, and I'm sure there will be others more pragmatic than yourself along eventually... Time will tell. But if you have no interest in what I offer now, begone.~
@58007 = ~Very well then. Go.~

@58014 = ~Khalid has asked me to handle this matter.~
@58015 = ~Excellent. Wait until you hear sounds of combat from the fort. I'm going to return there and fight with the defenders.~
@58016 = ~As you command.~
@58017 = ~I've learned a little about the crusade. Their leader is called the Barghest.~
@58018 = ~I've learned a little about the crusade. Their leader is a half-orc called the Barghest.~

@58020 = ~We should attack the crusade as soon as possible.~
@58021 = ~The Barghest of the Dragonspear Wars? I've heard of him. He's a dangerous opponent. ~

@58025 = ~I should be on my way.~
@58026 = ~I'm happy to lend my aid. Let's go.~
@58027 = ~I don't want the Flaming Fist facing the crusade alone. First, secure the aid of the Bridgefortians. Then tell me when they're ready to fight.~
@58028 = ~Join me first. I would fight at your side.~
@58029 = ~Hold. I don't want a fight—not just yet.~
@58030 = ~Good work so far. Let me know if you uncover anything else.~
@58031 = ~I like the sound of that. I'll join you and then we'll march out.~
@58032 = ~Wait until you hear sounds of combat from the fort. I'm going to return there and fight with the defenders.~

@58034 = ~Down With the Drawbridge~
@58035 = ~Down With the Drawbridge

I need to get inside Bridgefort and lower the drawbridge.

I convinced the dwarf lieutenant Kharm that I'm part of the crusade. He wants me to infiltrate Bridgefort and lower the drawbridge. This might quickly end the standoff, but at the cost of many lives.~
@58036 = ~Down With the Drawbridge

I must convince Mari to lower the drawbridge, or obtain her key somehow.

It seem the only key to the drawbridge mechanism is held by the guard Mari. I'll either have to convince her to lower the drawbridge or get my hands on that key.~
@58037 = ~Down With the Drawbridge

I brought down the drawbridge and put an end to this siege.

With all obstacles removed, I lowered the drawbridge as Lieutenant Kharm requested. I was still placed with the prisoners, though, and was forced to fight my way free.~
@58038 = ~Down With the Drawbridge

I brought down the drawbridge and put an end to this siege.

With all obstacles removed, I lowered the drawbridge as Lieutenant Kharm requested. After identifying myself, I was able to escape without harm, though the others in Bridgefort were taken prisoner.~

@58241 = ~Do I look like a crust of bread to you, maggot? No? Then stop trying to butter me up! See that recruit over there? KILL!~
@58242 = ~Yeah, that's the way you do it. Hit them where it hurts. ~
@58243 = ~I like your attitude. Face off against one of the recruits and do your best.~
@58244 = ~Do as I command and you will, yes. But before that happens, I want to see you work. Hit one of the recruits as hard as you can.~

@58281 = ~I've wasted enough time with this nonsense. I'll be on my way.~
@58282 = ~THEY take advantage of me! I'm too soft-hearted to turn them away. You think I should open my home for free?~
@58283 = ~Turning away those in need is contemptible. If you must charge those you shelter, be honest about the cost of opening your home. Ask for no more than you truly need.~

@58294 = ~You call that slop food? Three people up and left last night, figuring they'd have better luck getting a meal at the Iron Throne. And that was after they'd paid you your blood gold.~ [BD58294]

@58302 = ~Think of the thanks of the refugees raining down upon you, my lady, should you give provisions to those in need! Your name will be sung along with praise and blessings throughout the city.~
@58303 = ~That's outrageous.~
@58304 = ~Thank you. Here's the key to the chest upstairs. You'll find the supplies within. ~
@58305 = ~Outrageous, perhaps, but it's also the price. This is a seller's market, friend. If I gave goods away, I'd soon go out of business.~
@58306 = ~Garachen will never pay that much. I suppose I will.~
@58307 = ~Garachen certainly won't pay for the supplies. I'll return when I have enough gold.~

@58315 = ~What about him?~
@58316 = ~He's offering refugees shelter, but taking everything they own in exchange.~
@58317 = ~Never mind, I'll handle this on my own.~
@58318 = ~Distasteful, to be sure. But not illegal.~
@58319 = ~Some refugees left his home because the quarters were so cramped and the food so poor. Surely there are laws governing this sort of thing?~
@58320 = ~I understand. Thank you for your time.~
@58321 = ~No justice for those in need, then? Would that I found that surprising. I'll leave you to your business now.~
@58322 = ~As far as I know, folks're free to strike whatever bargain they like. There was nothing untoward about these refugees leaving, was there?~
@58323 = ~What if there was?~

@58325 = ~This is getting me nowhere. I'll handle it myself.~
@58326 = ~Well, in that case, we'd have to launch an investigation, of course.~
@58327 = ~I did hear... rumors... the refugees disappeared. Under mysterious circumstances. Sold into slavery, perhaps. Yes, that seems likely.~
@58328 = ~I can't lie to you, officer. The matter's as straightforward as they come. There's nothing there to investigate.~
@58329 = ~Forget it. I'll take care of matters myself.~
@58330 = ~That is a serious accusation. We'll have a talk with this Garachen and see what comes of it. Get along now and let me do my job.~
@58331 = ~Well, there you go then. Now get along; I've work to do.~
@58332 = ~Off with you, then. I've things to do.~

@58337 = ~And you are getting on mine. I'll be going.~
@58338 = ~Really? I didn't think you'd return. These supplies will help tremendously. I have to admit I haven't acted as honorably as I could have. Thank you for showing me another way.~
@58339 = ~Now I see why you're called the hero of Baldur's Gate. Bless you, <CHARNAME>, bless you. There are many here who'll not soon forget this. Here, take this gem. I hid it so Garachen wouldn't get his greasy paws on it. Uh, don't ask where.~ [BD58339]
@58340 = ~What? What are you talking about?~
@58341 = ~Master Garachen, you've been accused of selling your tenants into slavery. You'll be held at Flaming Fist headquarters until we conclude our investigation.~
@58342 = ~Slavery—? No! I didn—I never sold anyone! This is a mistake—you have to believe me!~
@58343 = ~Hah! Enjoy prison, Garachen. Don't worry, we'll take good care of your house while you're gone. Everyone who can fit sleeps here tonight!~

I should talk to people around camp and ask about the candle, potion bottle, and page of runes.

Safana came to me after picking some pockets around camp. One of her victims was carrying a notebook filled with sensitive information, meaning we might have a spy in camp. I need to investigate and find out who the traitor is. All I have to go on is the other items Safana stole.

One item is a potion bottle with an unusual shape. It might have been purchased in camp. Another item is a heavy candle with a gold leaf design on it. It looks like it might have religious significance. The last item is a page of unusual runes.~
@58634 = ~The Traitor

Next I can talk to Helvdar at the northern barricade.

This unusual bottle apparently belongs to Helvdar the dwarf. He guards the northern barricade.~
@58635 = ~The Traitor

I should next speak with this man, Col.

Helvdar the dwarf carries all his potions in bottles matching the one Safana stole. Helvdar told me he lost a potion in a card game last night with two other soldiers, and the winner's name is Col.~
@58636 = ~The Traitor

I should alert Nederlok about the traitor.

Helvdar the dwarf carries all his potions in bottles matching the one Safana stole. He must have been the traitor. I killed him for his crime.~
@58637 = ~The Traitor

I should speak to Warden Twoedged.

This encoded page may have come from Warden Twoedged, who works by the commanders' tents.~
@58638 = ~The Traitor

I should speak next to this soldier, "Col."

The encoded page belonged to retired Warden Simonetta Twoedged. She admitted she lent the book to Malden Col, a member of the Flaming Fist.~
@58639 = ~The Traitor

I should inform Nederlok about the traitor.

The encoded page belonged to retired Warden Simonetta Twoedged. She tried to talk her way out of it, but I could tell she was the traitor. I executed her.~
@58640 = ~The Traitor

I should next speak to this soldier, "Col."

A priest of Tempus named Mizhena confirmed that her holy candle was stolen. She suspects a soldier named Malden Col might have taken it.~
@58641 = ~The Traitor

I should inform Nederlok about the traitor.

When I confronted Malden Col with the evidence I've uncovered, he confessed. He'll be imprisoned and eventually hanged. That we could have a traitor in our midst all this time is disturbing. I should report this development to Marshal Nederlok.~
@58642 = ~The Traitor

Baxter Rendahl admitted to being the traitor. I executed him for his crime.~
@58643 = ~The Traitor

I've reported the traitor's name.

I went to Marshal Nederlok with my evidence regarding the traitor. He was upset that I took matters into my own hands but accepts the result of my investigation.~
@58644 = ~The Traitor

I've reported the traitor's name.

I told Marshal Nederlok of Malden Col's treachery. He was upset at the thought of a traitor in camp but was glad I handled it. We have to be more careful going forward—no one can be trusted.~
@58645 = ~"My Crusader Allies,

I've attached to this letter a more detailed description of <CHARNAME>, the so-called hero of Baldur's Gate. The descriptions supplied by the Revered have been pitiful at best. I have turned my considerable talent to creating a decent representation of <PRO_HISHER> face. 

Wait outside Dragonspear until <PRO_HESHE> passes by, then make your move. Be careful; <PRO_HESHE> is more powerful than you might expect. Subdue and capture <PRO_HIMHER> and return to the castle. Move quickly. I was almost discovered but was able to implicate another. I will remain in camp and continue to take subtle action against this coalition of fools. They will all fall to the Shining Lady.

I should continue to investigate Corinth's actions, then return to Leopas when I have the truth.

I had a conversation, if you could call it that, with the orc barbarian Ravoc regarding Valis's accusations against her fellow ranger, Corinth. He doesn't believe Corinth is guilty, if only because he thinks the man is a coward.~

@58813 = ~Yes. "Even" an orc.~
@58814 = ~You said they're in a chest. How am I supposed to recognize it?~
@58815 = ~Or kill us. Then someone else would have to face it, so that's good.~ [BD58815]
@58816 = ~The monster will fall.~
@58817 = ~It is. You have a problem with that?~
@58818 = ~But we will hurt you if you give us a reason.~
@58819 = ~Give us a reason. Please.~
@58820 = ~It's n-no use. We might as well be t-talking to a wall.~
@58821 = ~An understandably enraged wall, at that.~ [BD58821]
@58822 = ~Understanding the Crusade

After I talk to a few people around camp regarding the crusade, I can return to Morale Officer Deneld.

I spoke to Tristian, a cleric of the Red Knight. Conscripted by force when the crusade went through his village, he now seems happy to serve Caelar. He believes the Red Knight set him on Caelar's path, as the crusade needs planners and strategic minds.~
@58823 = ~Your faith in the Red Knight is weak. I suspected as much.~
@58824 = ~The Red Knight? She taught you nothing, fool. Whatever lesson you take from this came from our hand, no other's.~
@58825 = ~Zare~
@58826 = ~Tristian~
@58827 = ~You don't recognize crusade livery when you see it?~
@58828 = ~No, but as you can see I wear Caelar's colors. I am one of you.~
@58829 = ~Be on your way, then.~
@58830 = ~I wear crusade colors, do I not?~
@58831 = ~I recognize your uniform, but not your face. You'd not be the first of our foes to attempt to enter the castle in the guise of the faithful.~
@58832 = ~Taking risks isn't always a bad thing, Skie, but you have to know what you're risking. The crusaders are dangerous. We need to keep you safe.~ [BD58832]
@58833 = ~You handled that well, <CHARNAME>. I feared you'd be much harsher with her.~
@58834 = ~Perhaps I should have been. Skie needs to learn this isn't a game.~
@58835 = ~I wanted to be. Believe me, I wanted to. But someone's got to keep the girl safe.~
@58836 = ~I just want her out of my way. We need to get on with our mission.~
@58837 = ~There are some things a girl needs to learn on her own. Skie might have learned a lesson if faced with the consequences of her actions—but she'd probably be dead too.~ [BD58837]
@58838 = ~You sound like you're speaking from experience.~
@58839 = ~You say that like it's a bad thing.~
@58840 = ~Enough talk. We need to focus on our mission.~
@58841 = ~Heh. My father let me fall down a lot. At the time, it made me angry. I thought I'd never forgive him. Then I realized how hard it was for him to let me struggle—and fail—on my own. It made me the woman I am.~ [BD58841]
@58842 = ~A woman I'm very, very glad to know.~
@58843 = ~Grand Duke Silvershield seems unwilling to give Skie the same opportunities. I hope she finds her own path regardless. In any event, it's time we got on with our mission.~
@58844 = ~I'm more than happy to let Skie fall down, but we have more important matters to attend to right now.~
@58845 = ~We should get going.~
@58846 = ~Right. Let's go.~ [BD58846]
@58847 = ~Flatterer. I'm glad to know you too. Now let's get going.~ [BD58847]
@58848 = ~My toes itch, Boo. How much longer must I wait before we find a nice evil face worthy of kicking, do you think?~ [BD58848]
@58849 = ~There's no shortfall of faces deserving a good kick in this world. I'm sure we'll come across one sooner than later.~ [BD58849]
@58850 = ~And then Minsc does what he does best! Hehe!~ [BD58850]
@58851 = ~Ramble nonsensically to his pet rodent about other peoples' rears?~ [BD58851]
@58852 = ~And then Minsc will do what he does second best!~ [BD58852]
@58853 = ~Tell me, Captain Corwin—what is thine opinion of our friend, the hero of Baldur's Gate?~ [BD58853]
@58854 = ~Hadn't given it much thought. Having a famous hero around is handy, but it also seems to attract trouble.~ [BD58854]
@58855 = ~Or create it.~ [BD58855]
@58856 = ~Such people always invite hassles. You don't get called "hero" without someone trying to pull you down.~ [BD58856]
@58857 = ~Yet thou wouldst support our group and keep our companion standing in the face of those who wish us ill?~ [BD58857]
@58858 = ~That's my assignment, so yeah. Why do you ask?~ [BD58858]
@58859 = ~I just wanted to know where thou stood, should worse come to worst. And now I do.~ [BD58859]
@58860 = ~May I have a word, Captain Corwin?~ [BD58860]
@58861 = ~No. You can have five.~ [BD58861]
@58862 = ~I am sorry, I do not—that is six right there, eleven now... I am sorry.~ [BD58862]
@58863 = ~I though monks were supposed to be serene... It was a joke, Rasaad. What can I do for you?~ [BD58863]
@58864 = ~I was wondering if you had heard of any unusual disappearances of late. In Baldur's Gate, or elsewhere.~ [BD58864]
@58865 = ~As opposed to the USUAL disappearances.~ [BD58865]
@58866 = ~Before I left the city, several of my sect disappeared. More than can be explained by coincidence. I fear the followers of Selûne have been targeted.~ [BD58866]
@58867 = ~Now that you mention it, I did hear a couple Selûnites went missing. One was seen struggling with several robed figures, as I recall...~ [BD58867]
@58868 = ~The Fist started investigating, but with the iron crisis and now Caelar, we're spread pretty thin. I don't know what came of it, if anything.~ [BD58868]
@58869 = ~Thank you for this information. Believe me when I say it is much appreciated.~ [BD58869]
@58870 = ~So tell me, Captain—how did someone like you rise so high in the Flaming Fist?~ [BD58870]
@58871 = ~That depends what you mean by someone like me.~ [BD58871]
@58872 = ~There aren't many mothers who'd rather fight zealots thousands of miles from home when they could be making their children dinner and putting them to bed.~ [BD58872]
@58873 = ~Circumstances don't allow many people, mothers or otherwise, to do what they'd prefer.~ [BD58873]
@58874 = ~Nonsense. I do what I will, where I will, when I will, with whom I will.~ [BD58874]
@58875 = ~Keep flapping your lips and I'll show you a pathetic creature, you little tart.~ [BD58875]
@58876 = ~Captain Corwin, please! I meant no disrespect...~ [BD58876]
@58877 = ~I know what you meant. Next time, keep that thrice-damned pit of hell you call a mouth shut or I'll shut it for you.~ [BD58877]
@58878 = ~What are you playing at here, drow?~ [BD58878]
@58879 = ~I'm sorry?~ [BD58879]
@58880 = ~I found it unfortunate the Council of Four thought it necessary to recruit people like yourself and the duergar to this effort. Unfortunate, but understandable. I found it strange that <CHARNAME> would welcome a drow to walk beside us. Then I learned what you were capable of and it didn't seem so strange anymore.~
@58881 = ~I can't figure you out. What's the draw? What do you hope to gain from helping in this effort?~ [BD58881]
@58882 = ~Is it so hard to believe I might seek outcasts like myself, looking for companionship or even... support?~ [BD58882]
@58883 = ~It's very hard to believe. And that little speech doesn't make me believe it any more.~ [BD58883]
@58884 = ~You are a clever woman. I begin to see why our friend <CHARNAME> tolerates you.~ [BD58884]
@58885 = ~I do not understand, <CHARNAME>. The camp is safe. Why do we not stay within it?~ [BD58885]
@58886 = ~You've spoken of nothing but paying Caelar back since we left Coast Way Crossing.~ [BD58886]
@58887 = ~The shining harlot owes me a debt, it is true—but I plan to collect with two score Flaming Fist mercenaries at my side, not a handful of chimps.~ [BD58887]
@58888 = ~The Fist has better things to do than watch a Thayan braggart's back. You don't like the chimps, feel free to leave.~ [BD58888]
@58889 = ~Don't think I'm not tempted, you loathsome scapegrace! (Control, Odesseiron, control. The wench may yet prove useful...)~ [BD58889]
@58890 = ~I can hear you, you know. We all can.~ [BD58890]
@58891 = ~She's right. Think you're talking to yourself. You're talking to everyone.~ [BD58891]
@58892 = ~Shut your mouth! I'll not hear this baseless slander. (Calm yourself, Edwin. Ignore the monkeys; do not let them drag you down to their level.)~ [BD58892]
@58893 = ~Yes, by all means, ignore us.~ [BD58893]
@58894 = ~Most do.~ [BD58894]
@58895 = ~Well, what is this? The incorruptible Captain Corwin considers me a credible candidate for conversation?~ [BD58895]
@58896 = ~I did for a second. Then you spoke, and I reconsidered.~ [BD58896]
@58897 = ~Predictable. A preponderance of people do.~ [BD58897]
@58898 = ~Flaming Fist?~ [BD58898]
@58899 = ~I'm a captain of the Flaming Fist, if that's what you're asking.~ [BD58899]
@58900 = ~Fist killed my brother. And my cousin. And my other brother. And my uncle. And two of my other brothers.~ [BD58900]
@58901 = ~I'm sorry for your loss.~ [BD58901]
@58902 = ~Didn't like most of 'em. One of my cousins was all right. Didn't know him that well. Got a spear shoved through his face.~ [BD58902]
@58903 = ~You're not like any goblin I've ever encountered, you know that?~ [BD58903]
@58904 = ~You're not like any Flaming Fist I've met. Haven't tried to kill me. Yet.~ [BD58904]
@58905 = ~I'll take that as a compliment.~
@58906 = ~I would.~
@58907 = ~Ohhh, when you live for adventure,
You're never far from life.
When you're a slave who's indentured,
You'd better find a knife.
But if you long for a normal existence
And pursue it with dogged persistence,
You'll find that a normal life's,
The eeeasiest thing of alllllll...~ [BD58907]
@58908 = ~Yeah! I could've been a bard. I just never wanted to.~ [BD58908]
@58909 = ~Do you ever get tired, gnome?~ [BD58909]
@58910 = ~Never! Maybe. Tired of what?~ [BD58910]
@58911 = ~Being so... enthusiastic.~ [BD58911]
@58912 = ~Nah. It's like my mum always says: "Baravar's cloak, son, you're driving me mad. Stop bouncing your leg like that or I'll cut it off."~ [BD58912]
@58913 = ~Your mother's a very wise woman.~ [BD58913]
@58914 = ~Who said she was a woman? Just joking. Of course she's a woman. What else would a mum be? Other than dead. But then she wouldn't be always saying things like she does. Actually, that wouldn't be so bad, now that I think of it. Maybe I should... No. No, best leave well enough alone, don't you agree?~
@58915 = ~I'm going to stop talking to you now. And I'm especially going to stop listening.~ [BD58915]
@58916 = ~You do what you've gotta do, Cap'n. You'll get no argument from me.~ [BD58916]
@58917 = ~I could not live as you live, Captain Corwin. Always in the city, away from the green... Such a life would be unbearable.~
@58918 = ~Rohma makes it bearable. Trees and grass are fine, but she's what I really have trouble being away from.~ [BD58918]
@58919 = ~It was not always easy for Khalid and I to maintain our bond while we traveled, but we found our ways.~
@58920 = ~In-indeed. Though often s-separated, we always felt cl-close.~
@58921 = ~I hope Rohma knows my heart is always with her. But she's still a child. I worry.~ [BD58921]
@58922 = ~You're a f-fine fighter, C-captain Corwin.~ [BD58922]
@58923 = ~That's high praise, coming from someone who knows his way around a sword as well as you.~ [BD58923]
@58924 = ~I trained with the city militia back in C-c-calimport—dedicated warriors, all. Fighting for one's city inspires much d-d-devotion and courage.~ [BD58924]
@58925 = ~A city's just a bunch of buildings. It's ideals that inspire people. Principles. That's why the crusade's going to be so much trouble.~ [BD58925]
@58926 = ~I see. I, uh, I'll—I'll just leave you to your th-thoughts, then.~ [BD58926]
@58927 = ~Do you actually care about anything we're trying to accomplish here?~ [BD58927]
@58928 = ~I care about what I'M trying to accomplish. I care about the vengeance I will wreak on those who dared imprison me.~ [BD58928]
@58929 = ~But not about stopping the crusade? Or the damage they could do—have done—to the Sword Coast?~ [BD58929]
@58930 = ~Your woefully narrow perspective does you no credit, Captain.~ [BD58930]
@58931 = ~No. Then you would applaud the bold actions taken to stabilize the region under the auspices of a benevolent master—your master. Now ask this: Of the two of us, whose motives are more justified? You, who arbitrarily elevate one scheming aristocrat's agenda over another's, or myself, who seeks redress for a wrong done to his own person?~ [BD58931]
@58932 = ~Rationalize your selfishness and greed however you want, half-orc. In this instance, my cause is just. I fight for a higher ideal.~ [BD58932]
@58933 = ~You fight for money, Captain. That's what mercenaries do. Before you accuse me of rationalizing my actions, you would do well to examine your own.~ [BD58933]
@58934 = ~Hey, Corwin. Corrrrwin. Corrie. Can I call you Corrie?~ [BD58934]
@58935 = ~No. What is it, Neera?~ [BD58935]
@58936 = ~Nothing too important. I was just wondering how you think we're doing. As a team, I mean. The group of us, working together. Yep. Doing pretty good, huh?~ [BD58936]
@58937 = ~You're doing a good job. Your skills are proving invaluable.~ [BD58937]
@58938 = ~Really?! You mean it? That is... I... I wasn't worried about ME, exactly. It was the team, you know.~ [BD58938]
@58939 = ~It's a good team, Neera. We're fortunate you're part of it.~ [BD58939]
@58940 = ~Mistress Corwin, I take a moment of your time, ja? There is something I must say to you.~ [BD58940]
@58941 = ~Here it comes...~ [BD58941]
@58942 = ~Brace yourself, honey.~ [BD58942]
@58943 = ~Of all the warriors Voghiln the Mighty has fought with, and there are many, you are one of the best. To fight at your side is a great honor.~ [BD58943]
@58944 = ~That... that's it? That's all you wanted to say? Nothing about my appearance or the fun we'd have together?~ [BD58944]
@58945 = ~Voghiln does not talk ONLY about the womans. He appreciates a fine warrior when he meets one. Or perhaps it is that you want to hear how beautiful you are, ja?~ [BD58945]
@58946 = ~No, please don't. I mean... I'm fine. Thank you.~ [BD58946]
@58947 = ~ 'Tis good to be on the road again, Minsc, thou and I and our friend, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD58947]
@58948 = ~And Boo. None of this would be possible without him!~ [BD58948]
@58949 = ~Yes, of course. How could I have forgotten Boo?~ [BD58949]
@58950 = ~How could ANY of us forget? He mentions the little rat nearly every time he opens his mouth.~
@58951 = ~It is like old times again. Action! Adventure! Smashing evil! If there be danger about, Boo and I will protect you.~ [BD58951]
@58952 = ~I have no doubt of it. And I shall try to steer thee rightly in return.~ [BD58952]
@58953 = ~I think you are a strange warrior, Rasaad. Why do you wear no armor, carry no shield?~ [BD58953]
@58954 = ~Armor is too restrictive. It is better to never feel a blow than to expend energy warding it off.~ [BD58954]
@58955 = ~Speak for yourself, monk. Pain strengthens the body and the mind.~ [BD58955]
@58956 = ~Why not do both? Wrap yourself in steel and then do your fancy dodging dance for double the protection! Even Minsc could not hurt you then!~ [BD58956]
@58957 = ~I do not think—~ [BD58957]
@58958 = ~No, no. You are right. My mighty blows hit EVERYTHING. Ha! Even monks dancing in plate mail! Ha! What was I thinking? Ha!~ [BD58958]
@58959 = ~Minsc has a message for you.~ [BD58959]
@58960 = ~For me? From who?~ [BD58960]
@58961 = ~It is from Boo! He would like to say that you are a very pretty lady. Yes, and Boo has excellent taste, so this is quite a compliment. Uh, relish it.~ [BD58961]
@58962 = ~Your rat thinks I'm pretty, hm? That's adorable.~ [BD58962]
@58963 = ~Boo is no rat! He is a miniature giant space hamster. Do not offend him, lest he nibble your ears off in your sleep!~ [BD58963]
@58964 = ~Rat, hamster, what's the difference?~ [BD58964]
@58965 = ~What is the difference? Oh, Safana! You have so much to learn.~ [BD58965]
@58966 = ~You've given me much to think about. Why don't you bother someone else while I do so? Good boy.~ [BD58966]
@58967 = ~You show such devotion to your companions. Your witch and your... hamster, is it? It's an appealing trait you have.~ [BD58967]
@58968 = ~Oho! What game do you play here, evil elf lady? It will take more than compliments to make Minsc trust you!~ [BD58968]
@58969 = ~Hm. The barbarian's not COMPLETELY without sense. Who'd have thought?~ [BD58969]
@58970 = ~You are too suspicious, pale one. I merely made an observation.~ [BD58970]
@58971 = ~You do more than that—you said loyalty is "appealing." But Minsc has heard that drow betray each other at every turn.~ [BD58971]
@58972 = ~Oh, they do. That is why your loyalty appeals.~ [BD58972]
@58973 = ~Such muscles you have! Why if you were to have brains where your muscles were, imagine the wizard you could be!~
@58974 = ~A muscle-bound wizard with brains where his muscles should be? That does not sound much like Minsc.~
@58975 = ~Well, of course it's not. I'm saying if, you cretin, IF. A hypothesis, a conjecture. Do you not understand? (Get ahold of yourself; you're used to this by now!)~
@58976 = ~No, I do not think Minsc would enjoy that. He would cast a spell to return his muscles to their proper place. Boo is all the brains Minsc needs.~
@58977 = ~Muttonhead.~
@58978 = ~I do not understand the words you use, evil dark elf man.~ [BD58978]
@58979 = ~The cretinous quandary of a cut-rate consciousness.~ [BD58979]
@58980 = ~Yes, exactly!~ [BD58980]
@58981 = ~Must be nice being big. Your mind's bent, but no one pushes you around.~ [BD58981]
@58982 = ~Who pushes you around, little one? Minsc will show them the pointy end of his sword! Or maybe one of the sharp sides. Decisions, decisions...~ [BD58982]
@58983 = ~Everyone pushes me around. My family. My tribe. Other tribes. Humans. The world.~ [BD58983]
@58984 = ~But you walk free now, yes? There is no mean tribe, no angry humans around telling you what to do?~ [BD58984]
@58985 = ~Not for now.~ [BD58985]
@58986 = ~Then do as Boo does and enjoy the moment. In it, you are as big as you need to be.~ [BD58986]
@58987 = ~Gods help me. Minsc, I just had a thought. What if—WHAT IF I'm not a gnome? What if I'm actually a miniature giant space gnome? From spaaaace?~ [BD58987]
@58988 = ~Boo says that's crazy. You are a crazy in the head gnome.~ [BD58988]
@58989 = ~A crazy in the head gnome from spaaaace!~ [BD58989]
@58990 = ~I think not.~ [BD58990]
@58991 = ~I know! It's amazing—my absolute favorite thing about you. Other than Boo, of course. Gotta love the hamster.~ [BD58991]
@58992 = ~You may be crazy in the head, but Boo says you have taste.~ [BD58992]
@58993 = ~Friend Jaheira. In your travels, you have seen strange and wonderful creatures, yes?~ [BD58993]
@58994 = ~Many, yes.~
@58995 = ~And in your journeys, have you perhaps encountered a giant miniature space hamster other than Boo? A FEMALE giant miniature space hamster?~ [BD58995]
@58996 = ~I think we have more important things to do than this, don't you?~
@58997 = ~Are you sure? Boo is restless...~ [BD58997]
@58998 = ~D-do you think we will achieve victory over the crusade, f-friend Minsc?~ [BD58998]
@58999 = ~You doubt it? Look at our stalwart selves! Minsc is more stalwart than many, that is true, but you are not without a certain stalwartness yourself!~ [BD58999]
@59000 = ~Khalid is as stalwart as they come. None could say otherwise.~
@59001 = ~Our friend is a brave and wise leader, and of course we have Boo. The crusade will fall beneath our stalwart butt-kicking boots!~
@59002 = ~W-when you put it that way, I have no d-doubt.~ [BD59002]
@59003 = ~Minsc has not met many as strong as he is. But you, evil orc man, you may be as strong as Minsc. Perhaps stronger. Minsc does not say that often.~ [BD59003]
@59004 = ~"May be," ranger? Have no doubt of it. I could snap your bones like twigs and leave you lifeless on the ground.~ [BD59004]
@59005 = ~Aha! That is where you are wrong! For Minsc has Boo and our friend <CHARNAME>. Attack Minsc and you attack us all!~ [BD59005]
@59006 = ~I underestimated you. You offset your weakness allying yourself with the strong—a shrewd strategy.~ [BD59006]
@59007 = ~I have no strategy. Just friendship, and that friendship makes Minsc stronger than you will ever be.~ [BD59007]
@59008 = ~Can Minsc give you some advice, lovely elf lady?~
@59009 = ~Is this advice from your hamster friend?~ [BD59009]
@59010 = ~You wish. No, this comes from Minsc himself.~
@59011 = ~Too bad. I love that little hamster. He's the cutest thing! I wish I had a miniature giant space hamster.~
@59012 = ~I understand your envy. Do you want to hear my advice, little witch?~
@59013 = ~Hit me. No, stand back! It's a figure of speech. Tell me. That's what I meant to say. Tell me.~
@59014 = ~Many do not understand Minsc. And many do not understand your witchery. We can do nothing about this. People will do as they will, understand or not.~ [BD59014]
@59015 = ~To be happy, you must be true even though you are misunderstood. And if you can, get a witch and a hamster! They are good things to have.~ [BD59015]
@59016 = ~That's... actually pretty good advice. Huh. Thanks, big guy.~ [BD59016]
@59017 = ~Minsc, mine friend, I am thinking you need to relax. For warriors such as us, fighting should be for fun.~ [BD59017]
@59018 = ~Fighting evil is fun!~ [BD59018]
@59019 = ~But you seem not to enjoy the thrill of battle. You holler so loud banshees cringe, but I am never seeing a smile as you hack a foe to bloody chunks.~ [BD59019]
@59020 = ~I enjoy battle. I enjoy it much more than the people whose butts I kick.~ [BD59020]
@59021 = ~Being happier than one who is miserable, this is no great feat. Where is the joy, ranger? I ask you this, where is the joy?~ [BD59021]
@59022 = ~Boo was right about you, skald. You do not understand the Ice Dragon spirit.~ [BD59022]
@59023 = ~I feel comfortable in thy presence, monk. Thou hast a serenity about thee that pleases me.~ [BD59023]
@59024 = ~I am glad to hear it. But my heart is not so peaceful as it may seem. There are days, many days I yet find... trying.~ [BD59024]
@59025 = ~The worthy will ever strive to better themselves, but if I understand thy story correctly, thou art to be commended for how far thou hast come in life.~ [BD59025]
@59026 = ~I thank you for the compliment. Would that I could see in myself what you see in me.~ [BD59026]
@59027 = ~I do not know if I fully trust thee, Safana.~ [BD59027]
@59028 = ~I wouldn't if I were you. My mother always said, "You can always trust a man to do the wrong thing, but never trust a woman to do anything."~ [BD59028]
@59029 = ~Thy mother had a dim view of humanity.~ [BD59029]
@59030 = ~She knew humanity well. That does tend to adversely affect one's view of it, in my experience.~ [BD59030]
@59031 = ~Thou'rt thy mother's daughter.~ [BD59031]
@59032 = ~So she claimed. I have my doubts.~ [BD59032]
@59033 = ~Thou hast poor reasons for making this journey, drow.~ [BD59033]
@59034 = ~There are better reasons than survival and profit? I've yet to find them.~ [BD59034]
@59035 = ~Thou'rt in the Underdark no longer. Perhaps thou should'st make more of an effort to adapt to the surface world's ways.~ [BD59035]
@59036 = ~And if I did, what would it benefit me? My skin is black, my hair white. I am drow. Nothing I do will change how surfacers see me.~ [BD59036]
@59037 = ~Thou'rt wrong, Viconia. In the end, actions are what define us—not the color of our skin.~ [BD59037]
@59038 = ~That is what you want to believe, waela. I have been taught differently, and I learned my lessons well.~ [BD59038]
@59039 = ~Thou hast an odd way of speaking, Master Barrityl.~ [BD59039]
@59040 = ~You see MY speech as strange? My sides split!~ [BD59040]
@59041 = ~What dost thou mean?~ [BD59041]
@59042 = ~I appreciate an accomplished affectation as much as the next dark elf. But thees and thous are for actors and authors, not actual everyday elocution.~ [BD59042]
@59043 = ~Thou talk'st in riddles, drow.~ [BD59043]
@59044 = ~Uh-huh. Well, absolutely go on as you are. It's inferior entertainment for an enlightened observer, but in the absence of other amusement, I'll accept it.~ [BD59044]
@59045 = ~Thou'rt like no other goblin I have ever met, M'Khiin.~ [BD59045]
@59046 = ~What's a "thou"?~ [BD59046]
@59047 = ~Hm. In truth, I'd not given the matter much consideration before now. How to explain this? Well, um... thou'rt thou.~ [BD59047]
@59048 = ~So... "thou" means "you."~ [BD59048]
@59049 = ~Thou hast the truth of it. That is exactly right.~ [BD59049]
@59050 = ~I'd just say "you." It's easier. But talk how you want. Doesn't matter, long as you're happy. Thou're happy.~ [BD59050]
@59051 = ~"Thou'rt."~ [BD59051]
@59052 = ~Huh?~ [BD59052]
@59053 = ~Never thee mind.~ [BD59053]
@59054 = ~You've an interesting way of talking. I mean your language, not your means. My second cousin twice removed could make his posterior talk. Better company than he was.~ [BD59054]
@59055 = ~I do not understand what thou art trying to say.~ [BD59055]
@59056 = ~See, it's that, that right there. Thees and thous and thines. Isn't it easier to use yous and yous again and yours?~ [BD59056]
@59057 = ~When one's power comes from incantation, it is a wise wychlaran who keeps her tongue limber.~ [BD59057]
@59058 = ~Oh, oh, oh, so you do it to retain clarity, make sure your mouth can form the words and keep your mind sharp, that's what you're saying. Thou'rt saying?~ [BD59058]
@59059 = ~Perhaps that is the truth. Perhaps I just prefer a more formal affect. Who is to say?~ [BD59059]
@59060 = ~You're not going to tell me one way or the other, are you? Oh, I LIKE thee...~ [BD59060]
@59061 = ~It is good to once again travel with a woman who understands the trials of a life of adventure.~
@59062 = ~ 'Tis no easy life for thee or me, that is true. Danger awaits at every turn. There shall be no quiet home life for us, at least not for some time to come.~ [BD59062]
@59063 = ~I meant that you understand what it is to look after a man on the road.~
@59064 = ~Ah, yes, thou hast the truth of it. Without us to act as guide and mother and taskmistress all in one...~ [BD59064]
@59065 = ~The poor dears would stand no chance.~
@59066 = ~Thy actions in Bridgefort were impressive, Calishite. Without thee, it would surely have fallen well before we arrived.~ [BD59066]
@59067 = ~I did only what had to be done under the circumstances.~ [BD59067]
@59068 = ~It fell in the end, despite my b-best efforts.~ [BD59068]
@59069 = ~Some battles cannot be won, no matter the skill or the will of he who fights it. Be at peace with that, and thyself. Thou hast nothing to be ashamed of.~ [BD59069]
@59070 = ~Thank you, Dynaheir. It's n-nice of you to say. Perhaps someday I'll be able to be-be-believe it.~ [BD59070]
@59071 = ~Thou'rt as modest as thou art courageous. Noble to the core. I understand what Jaheira sees in thee.~ [BD59071]
@59072 = ~Oh. Uh, yes. Jaheira. I—well. Yes. I, I, I thank you, my l-lady. I'll just— Thank you.~ [BD59072]
@59073 = ~Thou art blushing! Oh, couldst thou be more adorable? I think not.~ [BD59073]
@59074 = ~Boo says you could not be more adorable. And look at Boo, look at that face, eh? He knows adorable.~ [BD59074]
@59075 = ~Thou'rt as modest as thou art courageous. Noble to the core. I begin to see what Jaheira saw in thee.~ [BD59075]
@59076 = ~I am watching thee, half-orc. Do not think thy deeds go unnoticed, or that they shall go unpunished.~ [BD59076]
@59077 = ~I've been judged by better than you, witch, and better still have tried to punish me. None have come to good ends.~ [BD59077]
@59078 = ~I have faced more fearsome things than thee, dark one.~ [BD59078]
@59079 = ~Your responsibility is to die by my hand?~
@59080 = ~Raise your hand to Dynaheir and you are the one who will be dying, half-orc.~
@59081 = ~You wanted to tell me I was observed. You have done so. When—if—you decide to do more than watch... well, that will be most interesting.~ [BD59081]
@59082 = ~We shall see.~ [BD59082]
@59083 = ~No! I do not like him either, but crawling into his armor to bite and tickle him would be unseemly for a hamster of your elevated stature.~ [BD59083]
@59084 = ~Wild magic is a defect in the Weave, one that may in time unravel the Weave itself. Thou'rt a grave danger to thyself and others, Neera.~ [BD59084]
@59085 = ~Hey, Dynaheir, thanks for telling me something I didn't already know from painful personal experience.~ [BD59085]
@59086 = ~Flaming obvious! Good one.~ [BD59086]
@59087 = ~What are you talking about now?~ [BD59087]
@59088 = ~That wasn't a joke? I mean... you burn things, right? So when you said "flaming obvious," I thought... well, you see where one could... Shutting up now.~ [BD59088]
@59089 = ~Wouldst thou learn how to properly turn the Weave to thine own purpose, Neera?~ [BD59089]
@59090 = ~Will it take long?~ [BD59090]
@59091 = ~Learning the proper use of magic takes years, decades. Surely thou knowest that already?~ [BD59091]
@59092 = ~Yeah... That's sorta why I stopped training. Also the thing with the fire. I think I'll keep muddling by on my own.~ [BD59092]
@59093 = ~As thou wish'st. But thou'rt making a mistake.~ [BD59093]
@59094 = ~At this point, I'm pretty used to that. Thanks, though.~ [BD59094]
@59095 = ~Voghiln. Thou art from the North, art thou not?~ [BD59095]
@59096 = ~Ja, this is true! I called Luskan home for many years, though I often ventured out into the cold and snow of the Spine of the World.~ [BD59096]
@59097 = ~I have never been to thy city. Perhaps when my task is complete, I will venture there and see it for mineself.~ [BD59097]
@59098 = ~If you would be liking a personal guide, beauteous one, I know a skald that may be able to help you out. I cannot recommend him highly enough, ho ho!~ [BD59098]
@59099 = ~I shall consider this. For now, I will settle for hearing more tales of your land.~ [BD59099]
@59100 = ~Do you think we shall be successful in our campaign against the crusade, my lady?~
@59101 = ~How should I know? I'm no strategist. I know one thing for certain, though: I'm getting out of this alive.~
@59102 = ~None of us can know our eventual fate. The gods and destiny play a hand in everything we do.~
@59103 = ~Says you. I say we control our own destinies. And whichever way this ill-fated campaign goes, I'll be standing at the end. Whatever it takes. Got that, sweetheart?~ [BD59103]
@59104 = ~If you say so, my lady.~ [BD59104]
@59105 = ~Sharran.~ [BD59105]
@59106 = ~Selûnite.~ [BD59106]
@59107 = ~For the moment, we must focus all our attention on Caelar's crusade. But when that is dealt with, we shall have words, you and I.~
@59108 = ~I look forward to it, ussta ogglin. You will be crying out my name in the dark before I finish with you.~
@59109 = ~I what? No, I meant we would... You misunderstand.~
@59110 = ~One of us does. I've never seen anyone turn that shade of red before. Perhaps you have learned a lesson today?~
@59111 = ~Master Odesseiron, I understand you hail from the country of Thay?~ [BD59111]
@59112 = ~Who told you that?! Have you been spying on me? A SPY, are you?~ [BD59112]
@59113 = ~No, not at all. You wear the colors of a Red Wizard and have referenced your home country several times.~ [BD59113]
@59114 = ~So YOU say... I'm on to you, monkey-monk. I'm watching you. Never forget that.~ [BD59114]
@59115 = ~I shall endeavor to keep this in mind.~ [BD59115]
@59116 = ~You've quite the quick and cunning combat style there, monk. Precise, powerful, just a pinch unpredictable.~ [BD59116]
@59117 = ~I learned to fight on the streets of Calimport. Perhaps I bring some of that recklessness to my combat even now.~ [BD59117]
@59118 = ~P-perhaps one day we could speak of C-calimport. I've not seen it for some t-time.~ [BD59118]
@59119 = ~A scintillating sparring style with no shortage of showmanship! Would you consider investing in an innovative arrangement? What I mean is—~ [BD59119]
@59120 = ~I understand well what you mean. My answer is no.~ [BD59120]
@59121 = ~A shame. But should your stance shift, be sure to say so.~ [BD59121]
@59122 = ~...so the Moonmaiden and her twin, Shar, are set one against the other, light battling darkness for all time.~ [BD59122]
@59123 = ~Maglubiyet eats whole cows.~ [BD59123]
@59124 = ~Er, I do not think you understand. Our Lady of Silver, Selûne, is with us in the light of the moon, you see. And Shar is ever present in the shadows.~ [BD59124]
@59125 = ~Does Selûne eat whole cows?~ [BD59125]
@59126 = ~Uh, I do not think so.~ [BD59126]
@59127 = ~Maglubiyet does. Maybe you should worship him.~ [BD59127]
@59128 = ~Your second-string surface gods are adorable. Ultimately, it's inevitable: The Spider Queen will eviscerate her enemies!~ [BD59128]
@59129 = ~Mmm... I will attend to other matters now, I think.~ [BD59129]
@59130 = ~...So she's the goddess of stars and navigation and wanderers. Sounds pretty good so far.~ [BD59130]
@59131 = ~Selûne is also worshipped by goodly lycanthropes.~ [BD59131]
@59132 = ~Goodly werewolves? Didn't know there was such a thing. Well, let's give that a pass. What I get caught up on is the light aspect.~ [BD59132]
@59133 = ~Without light, all would be darkness.~ [BD59133]
@59134 = ~That's true, that's undoubtedly true, a bit of a tautology, but I see what you're getting at, but... No. No, the light is just no good for me.~ [BD59134]
@59135 = ~I'm sure it's fine for some—a friend to most, even. But gnomes do better when we go unnoticed. Less trouble that way, you know?~ [BD59135]
@59136 = ~I believe I do.~ [BD59136]
@59137 = ~But thanks for explaining Selûne to me. It really was very interesting, and I expect you'll do quite well as one of her servants.~ [BD59137]
@59138 = ~Forgive me, Jaheira, but I do not understand. I thought you a champion of goodness. You say you are not?~ [BD59138]
@59139 = ~There is no good in nature, nor evil, either. The wolf devours the rabbit. Is this good or evil, do you think?~
@59140 = ~Well... neither, I suppose.~
@59141 = ~You monks sit in libraries, perusing musty tomes about good and evil. I do not make such distinctions. My world—the natural world—simply is.~
@59142 = ~Of course the druid disparages libraries. Only the refined can truly appreciate those cradles of knowledge and wells of arcane power.~
@59143 = ~An... interesting perspective. I shall have to think upon it.~
@59144 = ~Perhaps you could find a book to help clear the matter up.~
@59145 = ~An excellent idea. Have you any suggest... oh. You are teasing me now, yes?~
@59146 = ~There may be hope for you yet, Rasaad.~
@59147 = ~You are familiar with Calimport then?~ [BD59147]
@59148 = ~Oh y-yes! I spent many a h-happy hour at the Jet Jambiya. Wonderful ale.~ [BD59148]
@59149 = ~I remember it well. My brother and I would often linger outside the better taverns, looking for inebriated patrons to, ah, relieve of their valuables.~ [BD59149]
@59150 = ~I can't say it didn't happen to me from t-time to time. Perhaps you picked my pocket!~ [BD59150]
@59151 = ~Oh. Yes. Forgive me, my friend. I feel great shame for much of what I did before finding Selûne.~ [BD59151]
@59152 = ~I'm sorry, Rasaad. Making you uncomfortable was the l-last thing I wanted. Please, think nothing of it.~ [BD59152]
@59153 = ~I shall try to do so. I suppose I have not entirely put those days behind me. Even now they find a way to disrupt my serenity.~ [BD59153]
@59154 = ~I'll admit you are not without skill in combat, monk. Do not think that gives you license to challenge me.~ [BD59154]
@59155 = ~Why would I want to? I have no quarrel with you. And in the matter of Caelar, at least, we share a goal.~ [BD59155]
@59156 = ~I know your kind. All who sanctimoniously embrace "goodness" salivate at the very idea of my fall.~ [BD59156]
@59157 = ~And those who walk the path of evil will never know peace. I can imagine no fate worse than that.~ [BD59157]
@59158 = ~Perhaps if you learned to meditate, you would start fewer fires...~ [BD59158]
@59159 = ~No one's EVER going to let the fire thing go, are they? All right. I burn things. It happens.~ [BD59159]
@59160 = ~Most refrain from setting their own dwellings aflame when preparing a repast.~ [BD59160]
@59161 = ~"Most" people live in fear and misery. Maybe they SHOULD set their houses on fire to make dinner. Ever think of that?~ [BD59161]
@59162 = ~I admit, I had not.~ [BD59162]
@59163 = ~I think you may be on to something, Neera. What about a—a—a "fire box"? Something that continually emits fireballs! You could cook a potato in no time!~ [BD59163]
@59164 = ~You have spent your entire life learning the tales of your people, then, Voghiln?~ [BD59164]
@59165 = ~Each story has as many versions as there are elders to tell it. Each skald must take the pieces and make the tale his own.~ [BD59165]
@59166 = ~How can you be sure what you are telling is true, then?~ [BD59166]
@59167 = ~Ho ho! Is it truth you are seeking, or is it facts? Facts are simple; they are constant—anyone can be learning facts! Truth, though—this is not so simple.~ [BD59167]
@59168 = ~But ultimately, there can be but one truth—THE truth. Is this not so?~ [BD59168]
@59169 = ~You would make a poor skald, my friend.~ [BD59169]
@59170 = ~You've got a pretty good racket going on there.~ [BD59170]
@59171 = ~Pardon, rivvil?~ [BD59171]
@59172 = ~The "lady of mystery" thing. The beautiful drow: Who is she? What's her story? Subtlety—it drives men crazy. Maybe I'll give it a try someday.~ [BD59172]
@59173 = ~I wouldn't. It's not in your nature.~ [BD59173]
@59174 = ~How old ARE you, Thayan? You act like a child. Stop leering at me and look elsewhere.~ [BD59174]
@59175 = ~You flatter yourself, wench. I care naught for your tawdry charms. I was studying your cranium.~ [BD59175]
@59176 = ~Sure you were.~ [BD59176]
@59177 = ~Your head is plump and relatively well shaped compared to these cretins. Your brain might be adequate for wizardly pursuits.~ [BD59177]
@59178 = ~A compliment for my mind? That's a new one.~ [BD59178]
@59179 = ~You saucy strumpet, Safana. Your savory spirit stimulates me as scant few things do.~ [BD59179]
@59180 = ~I hope my spirit satisfies you, drow. You'll not be savoring anything else I possess.~ [BD59180]
@59181 = ~Never say never, darling.~ [BD59181]
@59182 = ~Never tell me what to say, "darling."~ [BD59182]
@59183 = ~What have we here? Is that a dagger's hilt in your hand, or are you just happy to see me?~ [BD59183]
@59184 = ~I'm not happy to see you.~ [BD59184]
@59185 = ~Your small-minded stance saddens me. We could've had something, were you not so steadfast in this silly stubbornness.~ [BD59185]
@59186 = ~I could make you sadder still, Barrityl. Find another playmate.~ [BD59186]
@59187 = ~You have a way with the womans, Baeloth. Your way leads right off a cliff, but it certainly is a way, that is undeniable, ho ho hoho!~ [BD59187]
@59188 = ~Maybe no one likes you because goblins are hideous little creatures, inside and out.~ [BD59188]
@59189 = ~Maybe.~ [BD59189]
@59190 = ~You're agreeing with me?~ [BD59190]
@59191 = ~Lived with goblins all my life. They are ugly. Think you know, but you don't.~ [BD59191]
@59192 = ~You're a woman of the world, Safana. You've experienced everything Toril has to offer, in all its glory and perhaps its squalor, yes...?~ [BD59192]
@59193 = ~Are you calling me old?~ [BD59193]
@59194 = ~What? No.~ [BD59194]
@59195 = ~You knee-biting little vagabond! I am a young woman in the prime of my life!~ [BD59195]
@59196 = ~I never said otherwise...~ [BD59196]
@59197 = ~You said more than enough. Talk to me like that again and I'll slap you so hard it'll knock the taste out of your grandmother's mouth.~ [BD59197]
@59198 = ~Forgive me, Safana. I just wanted to ask about your life in Baldur's Gate. You seem like such an interesting person...~ [BD59198]
@59199 = ~Well, you're right about the last bit at least.~ [BD59199]
@59200 = ~Womans, ja? What can you do?~ [BD59200]
@59201 = ~I think I'll keep doing what I've usually done—but more so.~ [BD59201]
@59202 = ~Nature? Who needs it? Burrs in your hair, spiders in the soup. Sleeping on rocks. Not a bathhouse in sight.~ [BD59202]
@59203 = ~Your eyes are open, but you see nothing. Witness the glowing colors of a sunrise. Hear a bird trill in the early dawn. It is breathtaking.~
@59204 = ~That's well and good for you. The outdoorsy look suits you and in any event you've already got a man. Me, I need silk sheets and bubble baths.~
@59205 = ~Your loss.~
@59206 = ~Keep on telling yourself that.~
@59207 = ~I-is it true that you sailed on a pirate ship?~ [BD59207]
@59208 = ~Now, Khalid. Does that sound like something I would do?~ [BD59208]
@59209 = ~I'm from Calimshan too. I've heard s-stories of the Exzeus. M-most were about ruthless attacks and insatiable greed.~ [BD59209]
@59210 = ~Have you? Did any mention the beautiful woman amongst the crew?~
@59211 = ~Y-yes. It sounds very much like something you would do.~ [BD59211]
@59212 = ~Hm. Flattery will get you everywhere, darling.~ [BD59212]
@59213 = ~I've held my tongue so far, but I've reached my limit. The half-orc reeks of sweat and blood. I can't be the only one who thinks so, can I?~ [BD59213]
@59214 = ~I assure you there are worse things to smell in this world than I, dear lady. Perhaps you are not meant for a life of adventure.~ [BD59214]
@59215 = ~I'm meant for a life of luxury, and I've made no secret of it. But I'd settle for one not permeated with the stench of death. It wouldn't kill you take a bath.~ [BD59215]
@59216 = ~While Caelar lives, we have more important things to do than bathe.~ [BD59216]
@59217 = ~If we can't spare even a moment to clean ourselves, the crusaders have won!~ [BD59217]
@59218 = ~That makes no sense.~ [BD59218]
@59219 = ~I was hoping you wouldn't notice that... Bloody hells. Someone give me a drink.~ [BD59219]
@59220 = ~It is a drink you are wanting? Voghiln is there for you.~ [BD59220]
@59221 = ~Pink hair, eh? That's an interesting look.~ [BD59221]
@59222 = ~Sure, make fun of my hair. Why not? Everyone's got SOMEthing to say.~ [BD59222]
@59223 = ~Your hair wasn't always pink?~ [BD59223]
@59224 = ~No. I figure one of these days a spell will go off and change my hair back. So far, nothing. But it hasn't turned into vipers either, so that's something.~ [BD59224]
@59225 = ~What color was your hair before?~ [BD59225]
@59226 = ~Lavender.~ [BD59226]
@59227 = ~Keep your hands to yourself, you bloody great oaf.~ [BD59227]
@59228 = ~Ho ho ho! She plays hard to get. I know the womans, liebchen. Your mouth says no, but your eyes say... maybe.~ [BD59228]
@59229 = ~What does a swift kick 'twixt the legs say?~ [BD59229]
@59230 = ~Ehhh... It says... "maybe later"?~ [BD59230]
@59231 = ~Gods! You're worse than Coran!~ [BD59231]
@59232 = ~...Who?~ [BD59232]
@59233 = ~(Steady, Edwin. Approach casually, make pleasant conversation.) So, Viconia... You are a feebleminded god-slave, and not a wielder of great arcane power?~ [BD59233]
@59234 = ~Hold your tongue, wael, or I will tear it from your mouth. Shar grants me powers beyond your imagining. They are nothing to scoff at.~ [BD59234]
@59235 = ~You misunderstand! I meant only that I am surprised you beg for scraps of power from Shar's table. I had heard the drow are extraordinary wizards.~ [BD59235]
@59236 = ~The males at Sorcere are, dobluth. I am not. Speak no more of this, lest you learn what power I have firsthand.~ [BD59236]
@59237 = ~There's no need for threats. (You try to compliment some people and what do you get?)~ [BD59237]
@59238 = ~Ulu z'hin maglust dal Qu'ellar lueth Valsharess zhah ulu z'hin wund lil phalar?~ [BD59238]

@59242 = ~Of all the surfacers here, I think you are the most likely to understand me.~ [BD59242]
@59243 = ~Don't know anything about dark elfs.~ [BD59243]
@59244 = ~You can count yourself lucky for that.~ [BD59244]
@59245 = ~Humans and their ilk hate and persecute us. We were both born to vicious societies, with the strongest and most ruthless ruling over the weak.~ [BD59245]
@59246 = ~Sounds like my tribe.~ [BD59246]
@59247 = ~The cringing males creep in our shadows while the women run our great cities.~ [BD59247]
@59248 = ~Except for that part.~ [BD59248]
@59249 = ~We have gnomes in the Underdark as well, you know.~ [BD59249]
@59250 = ~Svirfneblin? I wouldn't call them gnomes, exactly. Not GNOME-gnomes. They're a dour lot, aren't they? Dusty. And grim.~ [BD59250]
@59251 = ~I have met few of them. Menzoberranzan marched on the svirfneblin city Blingdenstone once. But they escaped our wrath.~ [BD59251]
@59252 = ~Those were some very lucky gnomes.~ [BD59252]
@59253 = ~We drow make tenacious enemies. Their luck may not last.~ [BD59253]
@59254 = ~It's little wonder the drow are so evil and twisted. To never see the sun or breathe fresh air... it is not a healthy way to live.~
@59255 = ~You only say so because the sun does not burn you, darthiir.~
@59256 = ~You have walked beside me in the light before. The sun hurts you no more than it does any other.~
@59257 = ~Had you lived in the cool and quiet dark of Menzoberranzan before ascending to the surface world's blinding light, you might think differently.~
@59258 = ~I suppose I should have expected no better from a disciple of the Nightsinger.~

@59262 = ~You should know I d-don't trust you. I'm prepared to defend myself.~ [BD59262]
@59263 = ~From what? I have no desire to harm you. Our goals are aligned, for the moment.~ [BD59263]
@59264 = ~It's the m-moment they aren't that worries me.~ [BD59264]
@59265 = ~So, you too know how it feels to receive instruction from a higher power.~ [BD59265]
@59266 = ~Do not compare your worship of Shar to the patronage of Ur-Gothoz. They are nothing alike.~ [BD59266]
@59267 = ~No? They seem most similar to me. Both offer power we could never attain alone in exchange for devotion.~ [BD59267]
@59268 = ~We are in no way alike, drow. Ur-Gothoz is no remote deity. His orders sound with perfect clarity in my ear.~ [BD59268]
@59269 = ~I wonder, is there anyone you would be content being compared to?~ [BD59269]
@59270 = ~There are none like me. None can understand the path I walk.~ [BD59270]

@59272 = ~So, Viconia. Viiiiiiconia. Vicci. Can I call you Vicci?~ [BD59272]
@59273 = ~Even you cannot be so fool as to ask this in earnest. Is this some ill-advised attempt at humor?~ [BD59273]
@59274 = ~Viconia, then. Fine. In that case, you must call me Neera.~ [BD59274]
@59275 = ~I have called you nothing else.~ [BD59275]
@59276 = ~Haven't you ever wanted to, though? Maybe... Neers?~ [BD59276]
@59277 = ~Definitely not.~ [BD59277]

@59281 = ~Back away, iblith, or I will teach you more of our ways than you ever wanted to know.~ [BD59281]
@59282 = ~Ho ho! I am beginning to understand these ways already, I think!~ [BD59282]
@59283 = ~This is outrageous! How is it I have fallen so far that I travel with a, a—a goblin! To ask such a thing is an insult, one I will not forget and never forgive.~ [BD59283]
@59284 = ~You're fat.~ [BD59284]
@59285 = ~You insolent monkey! How dare you speak to me thus? I should flay the flesh from your bones and make the air heavy with your screams!~ [BD59285]
@59286 = ~Try it. See what happens.~ [BD59286]
@59287 = ~You see the disrespect it shows me? Again I ask, how has it come to this?~ [BD59287]
@59288 = ~Don't know. Don't care. Keep whining if you want. I'm done with you.~ [BD59288]
@59289 = ~You are not unattractive, Jaheira. Opinionated and overly loud, but even so. Tell me, why do you waste your time with that st-st-stuttering ape Khalid?~
@59290 = ~He makes better company than small-minded, cruel little reptiles who would mock a person for their speech.~
@59291 = ~Cruel I may be—I live in a cruel world, which is to say the real world. But small-minded? I take exception to that, dear lady.~
@59292 = ~Take what you will. I care as much for your feelings as you do for Khalid's.~
@59293 = ~Then you are a greater fool than that oaf you call a husband. I am done with you.~
@59294 = ~I am glad to hear it.~
@59295 = ~Attend me, half-orc. We are men of considerable power. For now, we each have reason to ally ourselves with inferiors—good reason.~ [BD59295]
@59296 = ~You suggest we join forces in the event the Bhaalspawn falls or these others turn on us?~ [BD59296]
@59297 = ~Powerful friends are a good thing to have.~ [BD59297]

@59299 = ~We are in agreement, then?~ [BD59299]
@59300 = ~You are powerful, Thayan. But you are not strong. I'll not chain my fortunes to a pampered, simpering child, no matter how many fireballs he juggles.~ [BD59300]
@59301 = ~You impudent wretch! How DARE you—er, what I mean is, you should not pass up this opportunity. I urge you, reconsider your position.~ [BD59301]
@59302 = ~Or what? You'll mutter at me? I want nothing to do with you, wizard. And you would do well to expect nothing from me.~ [BD59302]
@59303 = ~So, Edwin. Eed-win. Eddie. Ed. Can I call you Ed?~ [BD59303]
@59304 = ~Why are you speaking to me, and how do I make you stop?~ [BD59304]
@59305 = ~Well—you're a Red Wizard, right? I've had some... issues... with them. I was wondering if you could maybe help me out?~ [BD59305]
@59306 = ~I could... but I won't. I don't like you, half-elf. I spent years mastering my craft. And you... YOU...~ [BD59306]
@59307 = ~So you won't help me because you're jealous?~ [BD59307]
@59308 = ~Jealous? JEALOUS? You know as little of me as you do magic. Go, leave me be. Your nattering makes my head ache.~ [BD59308]
@59309 = ~See? You should think about it, Ed. Revolutionize your country. ~
@59310 = ~Skald! If you dare include Edwin Odesseiron in one of your tales you will learn what SCALD means in Thay, courtesy of a burning fan of flame!~ [BD59310]
@59311 = ~Eh. It is your loss.~ [BD59311]
@59312 = ~GOOD. I am far too important a personage to be sung about in taverns and bawdy houses by capering imbeciles!~ [BD59312]
@59313 = ~But if you do put me in, it's Edwin Odesseiron. ODESSEIRON. One D, two S's.~

@59319 = ~You don't even know what the words you say mean, do you?~ [BD59319]
@59320 = ~You cretinous creature! My conversational comprehension is quite beyond compare!~ [BD59320]
@59321 = ~Still don't know what turdiform means.~ [BD59321]
@59322 = ~The connotation is clear, considering the context.~ [BD59322]
@59323 = ~What does it mean?~ [BD59323]
@59324 = ~Nix the nitpicking, you know-it-all nag, or I'll, I'll—~ [BD59324]
@59325 = ~Turdiform me?~ [BD59325]
@59326 = ~Why am I even talking to you?~ [BD59326]
@59327 = ~You have some mighty muscles there, mistress—~ [BD59327]
@59328 = ~Be silent, drow. I have no interest in fighting in your pit.~
@59329 = ~You misunderstand! I only observed that your obvious skill seems suitable—~
@59330 = ~I do not misunderstand. You've been asking everyone to fight in your pit. Recruiting new "talent" is likely the only reason you came on this journey.~
@59331 = ~Not true! I care considerably about quashing this cruel crusade! Our campaign will crush the contemptible Caeless!~
@59332 = ~"Caelar."~
@59333 = ~Eh. Whatever.~
@59334 = ~You were coached for combat in Calimshan, yes, Khalid? Quite the country, Calimshan. Its coliseums cultivated many a capital competitor.~ [BD59334]
@59335 = ~Do you know much about, about f-f-fighting styles?~ [BD59335]
@59336 = ~I would be a poor practitioner of my profession if I did not.~ [BD59336]
@59337 = ~What do you do, p-precisely?~ [BD59337]
@59338 = ~Makes slaves fight each other for money.~ [BD59338]
@59339 = ~I am Faerûn's finest purveyor of fight-focused fun. My pits have launched a near-limitless load of legends' livelihoods. I could do the same for you.~ [BD59339]
@59340 = ~Khalid! Come away from that vile slaver.~
@59341 = ~I-I don't think my wife would approve.~ [BD59341]
@59342 = ~Well, when you ditch the deadweight, do come discuss the destiny you desire with this dutiful drow.~ [BD59342]
@59343 = ~I f-fight because I must, not to—to entertain. I want no part of your pits. Find another stooge, drow.~ [BD59343]
@59344 = ~By Lolth's legs, you are a strappy little shaver, Dorn. Ever flirted with fighting to a fatal finish for fun and profit? Mostly profit?~ [BD59344]
@59345 = ~Yes. My own fun, and my master's profit.~ [BD59345]
@59346 = ~Ah. You already retain representation, then.~ [BD59346]
@59347 = ~My patron supplies me with all that I need.~ [BD59347]
@59348 = ~Well, should that situation shift, seek me out. I can steer you to a storied stature you never supposed securable.~ [BD59348]
@59349 = ~Do not delude yourself into believing you comprehend the scope of MY ambition, drow. Begone!~ [BD59349]
@59350 = ~A wily wizardess like you would make a worthy pit warrior! None would know what you might sorcer up next!~ [BD59350]
@59351 = ~Hm... I can see it. Neera the Magnificent, they'd call me! What will I do to my next opponent? Turn them into a hedgehog? Or make their blood ACID?~ [BD59351]
@59352 = ~It's not as fun as you think, half-elf.~ [BD59352]
@59353 = ~Such spirit! I shall study your strengths when our current campaign concludes.~ [BD59353]
@59354 = ~Of course, I'd be just as likely to turn the audience's blood to acid. That would be one downside. But an audience of hedgehogs would be adorable!~ [BD59354]
@59355 = ~Ah. I start to see some shortcomings with my speculative assessment of your suitability. Let us leave the matter for the moment.~ [BD59355]
@59356 = ~Forsooth, my fine fellow, your facial fungus is phenomenal.~ [BD59356]
@59357 = ~Eh? The words you speak, they mean something to you? For Voghiln, not so much.~ [BD59357]
@59358 = ~Your handsomely hirsute jowls appeal to my aesthetic appreciation.~ [BD59358]
@59359 = ~One more time?~ [BD59359]
@59360 = ~He likes your beard, Voghiln.~ [BD59360]
@59361 = ~The fine fur flowing from your face!~ [BD59361]
@59362 = ~Ja, I am understanding now. It is a mighty warrior's beard, is it not?~ [BD59362]
@59363 = ~Verily.~ [BD59363]
@59364 = ~I'm curious, M'Khiin. What was your life like before this? What's it like being a goblin?~ [BD59364]
@59365 = ~What's it like being a gnome?~ [BD59365]
@59366 = ~Depends on the gnome, really. I get to go places and do things and meet new people. And being a gnome, I get away with some pretty crazy things.~ [BD59366]
@59367 = ~Being a goblin isn't like that. At all.~ [BD59367]
@59368 = ~Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.~ [BD59368]
@59369 = ~Used to it.~ [BD59369]
@59370 = ~You don't talk much.~ [BD59370]
@59371 = ~Silence is a worthwhile skill to cultivate. I speak when I have something worth saying.~
@59372 = ~I like that.~ [BD59372]
@59373 = ~Thank you. Silence is a worthwhile skill to cultivate.~
@59374 = ~I never thought I'd see the d-day when I'd stand shoulder to sh-shoulder with a g-g-goblin.~ [BD59374]
@59375 = ~Shoulder only comes up to your stomach. You're standing stomach to shoulder with a goblin.~ [BD59375]
@59376 = ~You know what I m-mean.~ [BD59376]
@59377 = ~I know what you said. It was wrong.~ [BD59377]
@59378 = ~I'm starting to s-see why I never stood stomach to shoulder with a g-g-goblin before...~ [BD59378]
@59379 = ~We have something in common, goblin. To the humans, the elves, we are monsters, nothing more.~ [BD59379]
@59380 = ~Let 'em think that. Maybe safer that way.~ [BD59380]
@59381 = ~Were we not aligned with the hero of Baldur's Gate, they would kill you without a second thought—or in many cases, a first one.~ [BD59381]
@59382 = ~Just want them to think enough times that they don't kill me.~ [BD59382]
@59383 = ~And if Caelar or one of her lackeys removes your protector, <CHARNAME>, permanently?~ [BD59383]
@59384 = ~If this, if that—can't worry about ifs. Too many of 'em. What is is all that matters.~ [BD59384]
@59385 = ~So, M'Khiin, that thing you do with ghosts? Really neat. Not for the person under ghost attack, or probably for the ghosts, but watching it? Neat!~ [BD59385]
@59386 = ~If you say so.~ [BD59386]
@59387 = ~I wish I could do something like that. Well, I could do something LIKE that, but not exactly. I wouldn't be able to control it so well, probably, but it'd still be...~ [BD59387]
@59388 = ~Neat.~ [BD59388]
@59389 = ~REALLY neat. You have to show me how to do it sometime. And I could show you how to do what I do. Well, I couldn't really show you HOW, exactly.~ [BD59389]
@59390 = ~Maybe be quiet now. Don't want to run out of things to talk about next time.~ [BD59390]
@59391 = ~So, Jaheira, you and Khalid, you two've been together a while now, have you?~ [BD59391]
@59392 = ~More than ten years, married for eight of them.~
@59393 = ~It feels longer sometimes. The j-joy I feel is s-seemingly without end.~ [BD59393]
@59394 = ~Ten years, huh? That IS impressive. And you're happy together? With each other?~ [BD59394]
@59395 = ~I c-cannot picture a life without my love Jaheira.~ [BD59395]
@59396 = ~Oh, that's just lack of imagination. We can work on that.~ [BD59396]
@59397 = ~Why do you ask these things?~
@59398 = ~Hm? Oh, no reason. Just trying to, you know, get to know the members of my party. Is there anything you'd like to know about me?~ [BD59398]
@59399 = ~If I think of something, I'll let you know.~
@59400 = ~Hey, Khalid, I just wanted to say, what you did at Bridgefort, that was very good of you. You really did right by those people.~ [BD59400]
@59401 = ~I t-t-tried. I don't know how successful I was.~ [BD59401]
@59402 = ~You're being way too hard on yourself. You need to relax, you really, really do. I'm getting edgy just standing next to you.~ [BD59402]
@59403 = ~You know what is at s-stake in this venture, Glint. How am I supposed to relax with the Sword Coast's fate in the balance?~ [BD59403]
@59404 = ~It's easy. Just do what I say. First, close your eyes. That's right, take a deep breath. Hold it, holllld it, now release... good... Now...~ [BD59404]
@59405 = ~RELAX!~ [BD59405]
@59406 = ~Ahhh!~ [BD59406]
@59407 = ~See? Easy. Don't you feel better now? I feel better now.~ [BD59407]
@59408 = ~So, Dorn. Dorn, Dorn, Dornnn...~ [BD59408]
@59409 = ~You have something to say to me, gnome? Then say it, or say nothing at all.~ [BD59409]
@59410 = ~I was just going to ask you how the weather was up there.~ [BD59410]
@59411 = ~What?~ [BD59411]
@59412 = ~It was a joke, you know. How is the weather up there? Because it'd be different. Because you're, uh, tall.~ [BD59412]
@59413 = ~You should go away now.~ [BD59413]
@59414 = ~Yes. Yes, I think I'll be doing that right, uh... now. Yes.~ [BD59414]
@59415 = ~In my defense, you are VERY tall. All right, I'm done, going now. Yes, yes.~ [BD59415]
@59416 = ~Yeah, yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah, I've seen those once or twice. They are aMAZing. The way they fly through the air and then, you know...~ [BD59416]
@59417 = ~I totally know! Like how they do that thing, that twisty thing?~ [BD59417]
@59418 = ~LOVE the twisty thing.~ [BD59418]
@59419 = ~The one I saw did a DOUBLE twisty thing.~ [BD59419]
@59420 = ~NO. A double twisty bit? That's—Cloakshadow's black silk lining, I can't even think what it'd be like with a double twisty thing.~ [BD59420]
@59421 = ~I was impressed. But it's real dangerous. I'm surprised the big man didn't have his nose melted, you know?~ [BD59421]
@59422 = ~Oh, the nose melt. I saw that once, just with a single twist. Not pleasant. But for a double twisty? Totally worth it, I'd say.~ [BD59422]
@59423 = ~It really, really was. That was a good day.~ [BD59423]
@59424 = ~I'll bet.~ [BD59424]
@59425 = ~Does anyone know what the hells these two are talking about?~ [BD59425]
@59426 = ~Gardening, I think.~ [BD59426]
@59427 = ~..."That was no goat, that was my wife!" And the drunkard says to him, he says, he says, "By the Oak Father's mossy beard! I thought she was both! Hahaha!"~ [BD59427]
@59428 = ~So the sheepherder's wife looked like a goat...?~ [BD59428]
@59429 = ~Ja, she looked like a goat. Ho ho! Funny, eh?~ [BD59429]
@59430 = ~Not that funny for the sheepherder.~ [BD59430]
@59431 = ~You are not the sheepherder, my little friend.~ [BD59431]
@59432 = ~Well, no, obviously not; the sheepherder had a wife. But even so, you have to feel a little bad for the poor fellow, don't you?~ [BD59432]
@59433 = ~No, you don't feel bad for him. It's a joke, and the sheepherder is its butt!~ [BD59433]
@59434 = ~Did someone say butt? Is there one in need of kicking? Minsc is ready!~ [BD59434]
@59435 = ~The sheepherder is funny! You laugh at him! Eh... I guess you had to be there.~ [BD59435]
@59436 = ~Why do we tolerate this villain's presence among us? There are monsters enough in this world without inviting one into our circle.~
@59437 = ~You call me a monster?~
@59438 = ~You deny it?~
@59439 = ~I'll not waste my time arguing with you. Let me suggest this, though: Only a fool goes out of her way to antagonize a monster.~
@59440 = ~Hey, Jaheira, have you ever noticed that our names rhyme? When they write epic songs about our deeds here, I bet they'll put our names together a lot!~ [BD59440]
@59441 = ~What makes such strange thoughts flit through your head, child?~
@59442 = ~I don't know... Maybe wild magic makes my thoughts wild too. Mixes them up, like scrambled eggs. On toast. With stewed tomatoes.~
@59443 = ~Maybe some fresh fruit on the side, and a little hot tea. I'm going to go eat. We'll talk later.~
@59444 = ~Come on. Just a little peck on the cheek. What's the harm in that?~ [BD59444]
@59445 = ~It'll be in my husband's fists if he finds out about it.~
@59446 = ~Vot? Your husband raises his hand to you? This is not acceptable.~
@59447 = ~No, you idiot. He'll raise his hand to you. And then bring it down on you, over and over again, like a hammer from the heavens.~
@59448 = ~Oh, he'd hit ME? Ja, this makes more sense.~
@59449 = ~I d-don't think I l-like you, half-orc.~ [BD59449]
@59450 = ~I know of a certainty I don't care for you. When you know your own mind, tell me.~ [BD59450]
@59451 = ~I d-d-definitely don't like you.~ [BD59451]
@59452 = ~Better. Now, what do you plan to do about it? Fight me? Try to kill me? Or do we put our feelings aside and save our hostility for Caelar?~ [BD59452]
@59453 = ~Were it not for our f-friend <CHARNAME>, we would fight.~ [BD59453]
@59454 = ~Congratulations, hero! In addition to Baldur's Gate and the Sword Coast, you have yanked a stuttering fool from the brink of utter destruction. Well done.~ [BD59454]
@59455 = ~You should thank Gorion's ward for saving your life. Khalid would cut you down before you even unsheathed your blade.~
@59456 = ~Well... maybe not QUITE that quickly. Especially as his sword's already drawn.~ [BD59456]
@59457 = ~Your humility is one of the countless reasons I love you, Khalid, but this is not the time for it.~
@59458 = ~Y-yes, dear. As you say.~ [BD59458]
@59459 = ~How are you holding up, Neera?~ [BD59459]
@59460 = ~I'm fine, Khalid. I mean, I will be fine. You know, when this is all over.~ [BD59460]
@59461 = ~You're sure? You're not too t-t-tense? I mean, obviously we're all under stress, but you're not going to... you know.~ [BD59461]
@59462 = ~No, I don't know. Not going to what?~ [BD59462]
@59463 = ~Well, there was the... incident at Bridgefort. I—I h-hate to bring it up, but there are s-safety issues...~ [BD59463]

@59485 = ~Ja, this is true. The Nightmares were the terror of the Ten Towns, but no match for mighty Voghiln!~ [BD59485]
@59486 = ~The Nightmares' hands could shatter stone and their fangs were sharper than any dagger, or so the stories go.~ [BD59486]

@59525 = ~My life is in your hands.~
@59526 = ~Considering the situation, you've probably already figured this out, but long-range planning really isn't my forte.~

@59537 = ~I care nothing for your message any more than I care for the orders of the Grand Dukes.~
@59538 = ~Blood is not forgiveness, and there is nothing in your message that will justify the deaths you have caused.~

@59541 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage~
@59542 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

I should keep watch for the ingredients Neera needs for her potion.

Neera the wild mage needs the following ingredients for a potion to free herself of the influence of the wild mage Adoy: a leg from a seven-legged spider, a feather from a planetar's wing, belladonna, a potion of perception, and the juice of one turnip.~
@59543 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

I should look for more components to Neera's potion.

I've found another component of Neera's potion. That makes two I've found so far. Once it's complete, she'll be able to drink the potion and rid herself of Adoy's voice.~
@59544 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

I should look for more components to Neera's potion.

I've found another component of Neera's potion. That makes three I've found so far. Once it's complete, she'll be able to drink the potion and rid herself of Adoy's voice.~
@59545 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

I should look for more components to Neera's potion.

I've found another component of Neera's potion. That makes four I've found so far. Once it's complete, she'll be able to drink the potion and rid herself of Adoy's voice.~
@59546 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

I should keep looking for the components for Neera's potion.

I secured the feather of a planetar's wing, one of the ingredients Neera requires for the potion to rid herself of Adoy's constant presence.~
@59547 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

Voghiln told us where we can find a seven-legged spider, in a cavern to the east.

Apparently the Luskan bard, Voghiln, encountered a seven-legged spider in a cavern east of here. Neera believes the leg of such a spider will help her in concocting a potion to rid her of of the unwanted presence in her mind.
~
@59548 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

I told Neera where we can find a seven-legged spider, in a cavern to the east.~
@59549 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

I hope to find a cavern where spiders might live.

Neera needs to find a seven-legged spider. I should look for a cave or other underground passage where spiders might live.~
@59550 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

I gave Neera a leg from a seven-legged spider.~
@59551 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

I should keep looking for the components for Neera's potion.

Neera found the leg of a seven-legged spider, one of the ingredients for a potion she needs to drive Adoy from her mind.~
@59552 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

I should keep looking for the components for Neera's potion.

Neera now has a potion of perception. Hopefully, it'll help her perceive a bit of quietude when she's able to combine it with the other ingredients she seeks to get Adoy out of her head.~
@59553 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

I've found the belladonna that Neera needs.

Although belladonna is dangerous, we've collected some for Neera's potion. Hopefully we can find the rest of the supplies she needs and this potion will work.~
@59554 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

The next time I camp, Neera will make her potion.

Neera's ready to make her potion. We just need to make camp to give her the proper time.~
@59555 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

Neera has made the potion she requires.

Neera made her potion and is free of Adoy. I'm glad to have her back in a condition where she can be of use. Her skills will be needed if we're to complete our mission.~
@59556 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

Neera has made the potion she requires.

Neera made her potion but decided not to rid herself of Adoy permanently. Apparently he is trapped on the Fugue Plane. Neera believes if we can find a place called the Mountain of Nepenthe, she can restore Adoy and be permanently free of him.~
@59557 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

The next time we camp, Neera will make her potion.

Neera's ready to make her potion, even without all the ingredients. We just need to make camp to give her the proper time.~
@59558 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

It seems Neera's alchemy attempts have concluded.

Neera drank the potion she made, even though it wasn't made properly. She paid a price for it, but it's one she can live with.~
@59559 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

It seems Neera's alchemy attempts have concluded.

Neera drank the potion she made, even though it wasn't made properly. She paid a heavy price for it. I hope her experimentation was worth it.~
@59560 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

I should keep looking for the components for Neera's potion.

Neera has procured the turnip juice she requires for her potion. We purchased some from a very dedicated gnome.~
@59561 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

I should keep looking for the components for Neera's potion.

I procured some turnip juice. I believe this is what Neera requires for her potion. I purchased the juice from a very dedicated gnome.~
@59562 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

I should search for a portal to the Fugue Plane.

I must find the Fugue Plane to release Neera from the distraction of the wild mage Adoy's spirit. Neera senses the "mountain" of Nepenthe is very close, somewhere in these caverns.~
@59563 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

Adoy's spirit has left Neera's mind.

I helped Neera set Adoy's spirit free. She is now as calm and focused as she ever gets. Unfortunately, Adoy implied the Red Wizards are hunting Neera, and other wild mages too. Neera will have to deal with this sooner or later.~

The mummy and I have completed our dealings.

After dealing with Korlasz, I returned to the mummy's chamber. The creature bestowed a reward on me in exchange for my service.~

Korlasz is dead and my quest finished.

I have defeated Korlasz the wizard. All those who conspired with Sarevok are gone. Perhaps now I can find peace.~
@59573 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

Korlasz has surrendered, and my quest is over.

Through luck and skill, I was able to talk Korlasz into surrendering. She will face a long and difficult sentence in the Grand Dukes' jail. She deserves no better a fate. Now all the conspirators who worked for Sarevok are gone. Perhaps now I can find peace.~
@59574 = ~The Shifting Face

As if I haven't been through enough already, I was forced to face a doppelganger disguised as Imoen. Fortunately, the creature revealed itself, and I was able to dispatch it before it did any serious damage. I despise those foul creatures.

@59639 = ~Recruitment Drive 

Viconia has joined my party.

A drow cleric of Shar, Viconia DeVir, was among those in Pfaug Hammerlust's company, but no longer. Now she stands beside me, for as long as she remains useful.

If I dismiss Viconia, she will travel with Pfaug with the Flaming Fist caravan. I can find her at the Flaming Fist camp.~
@59640 = ~Recruitment Drive

Viconia has joined my party.

The drow Viconia DeVir has joined my party, though I have reservations about bringing a cleric of Shar into close quarters with a worshipper of Selûne. I'll have to keep a close eye on her and Rasaad.

If I dismiss Viconia, she will travel with the Flaming Fist caravan and I can find her at their camp.~
@59641 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I gave a rousing speech to the crowd as I left the city.

My departure from Baldur's Gate was not without incident. People are slowly becoming aware of Sarevok's and my shared lineage. Fortunately, I am "the hero of Baldur's Gate." The crowd gave me a chance to speak, and I did what I could to put them at ease.~
@59642 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

The people of Baldur's Gate seem suspicious of me.

The lineage I share with Sarevok is no longer as secret as it once was. The fools who bow to the Grand Dukes fear me, and rightly so. They'll not act against me, not directly. And when I return, my actions and victories will have won them over.~
@59643 = ~Unexpected Allies~
@59644 = ~Unexpected Allies

I've welcomed Edwin into my party.

I have reunited with the Thayan mage Edwin Odesseiron. His power will doubtless be of use in the battle with Caelar. If dismissed, I can find him at the Flaming Fist camp.~
@59645 = ~Edwin's Tale of Woe~
@59646 = ~Edwin's Tale of Woe

Edwin is fleeing Caelar Argent. Is she nearer than we thought?

It seems I'm not the only one to whom Caelar has done an injustice. Edwin has told me more of his reasons for desiring a confrontation with the Shining Lady.~
@59647 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I should return to camp and talk to Bence Duncan.

The crusade has destroyed the bridge. We must circle around to Bridgefort and Boareskyr Bridge. The way will be long, but hopefully Corporal Duncan can lead the troops quickly to our new goal.~
@59648 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I should return to camp to discuss the situation with Bence Duncan.

I spoke with Caelar Argent across the Winding Water. While she explained the righteousness of her actions, it is my duty to protect others from her crusade, including the people of Baldur's Gate.~
@59649 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I should return to camp to discuss the situation with Bence Duncan.

I spoke with Caelar Argent across the Winding Water. She is convinced of the righteousness of her actions, and both her aims and her conviction gave me pause. Still, the damage wrought in her name far outweighs any seeming greater good she seeks to achieve.~
@59650 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I should return to camp to discuss the situation with Bence Duncan.

I spoke with the madwoman Caelar across the Winding Water. What little is left of her sanity was swept away in the wreckage of the bridge her crusaders destroyed. She will answer for her crimes with her life.~
@59651 = ~Unexpected Allies

I've kept Edwin in my party.

Edwin Odesseiron and Rashemi are like fire and oil. I need to keep the two apart, so I've decided to keep Edwin in my party and watch over him. The others will wait at the Flaming Fist camp.~
@59652 = ~Unexpected Allies

I've sent Edwin back to camp.

Edwin Odesseiron and Rashemi are like fire and oil. I need to keep the two apart, so I sent Edwin back to camp, perhaps the Fist can calm him while we continue on.~
@59653 = ~Unexpected Allies

I can regroup with my companions at the next Flaming Fist camp.

I've done what I can at Coast Way Crossing. We must forge ahead to Bridgefort and Boareskyr Bridge. If I need to find any companions I dismissed or didn't bring with me, they will wait at the Flaming Fist camp near Boareskyr Bridge.~

I could scout the area between the camp and the river.

The Flaming Fist have set up camp for the night. I have decided to scout ahead and see what lies on the road ahead before we reach the Winding Water.~
@59658 = ~Schael Corwin

Captain Corwin has joined my party.

Captain Corwin insisted on accompanying me to protect me—on orders from the Grand Dukes. Apparently, the dukes don't believe the <PRO_MANWOMAN> who defeated Sarevok can handle Caelar and her crusade—that, or they don't trust me. Whatever their motivation, I won't have to ask Corwin to accompany me, and should she depart, I'll see her back at the camp.~

Captain Corwin insisted on accompanying me to protect me—on orders from the Grand Dukes. Apparently, the dukes don't believe the <PRO_MANWOMAN> who defeated Sarevok can handle Caelar and her crusade—that, or they don't trust me. Still, Corwin is an experienced soldier, and an extra blade and extra pair of eyes are welcome. Should we become separated, we can meet back at camp.~
@59660 = ~Schael Corwin

I refused Captain Corwin's offer of aid, though I can change my mind later if I like.

Captain Corwin insisted on accompanying me to protect me—on orders from the Grand Dukes. Apparently, the dukes don't believe the <PRO_MANWOMAN> who defeated Sarevok can handle Caelar and her crusade—that, or they don't trust me. I have refused Corwin's offer to shadow me. If I have need of her, I'm sure I can find her back at camp with the rest of the troops.~

@59668 = ~Perhaps... How fares the city during all this turmoil?~
@59669 = ~If you believed that, I'd have heard the theory from you, not your daughter. Good night.~
@59670 = ~If you go back into the city, I'll follow you. Remember, we head out first thing in the morning. Once you're back in your room, there'll be no more time to go back into the city. The dukes have declared that the expedition must leave in the morning.~ [BD59670]
@59671 = ~Time preparing is not time wasted, and a few more days will not matter.~
@59672 = ~But there are more merchants I would barter with.~
@59673 = ~Time does not shackle my actions, nor do you.~
@59674 = ~Our orders are to head out at dawn. You can go back into Baldur's Gate again if you wish, but once you head back to your room I'll be going home to see my daughter. I make it a point not to keep her waiting.~

@59676 = ~We're going.~

@59687 = ~The others are getting anxious. We need to deal with Korlasz quickly. Is that door locked?~
@59688 = ~I bet one of Korlasz's cronies had a key on them. Look around for it.~
@59689 = ~The door to the next room is locked. If you can't find a key on one of these bodies, let me know. I'll try to pick the lock.~

Minsc will only join me if Dynaheir does as well.

I met Minsc and his miniature giant space hamster, Boo, at the Three Old Kegs. I must convince Dynaheir to join me on the trek to Dragonspear Castle if I wish to have Minsc at my side.~
@59697 = ~Recruitment Drive

Minsc and Dynaheir will be at the Three Old Kegs if I need them.

I don't know who thought recruiting Minsc and Dynaheir to join me on the journey to Dragonspear was a good idea. Whoever it was was wrong, in my estimation. I have left them at the Three Old Kegs Inn, where I can find them again if need be.~
@59698 = ~Recruitment Drive

Minsc and Dynaheir have joined my company.

The ranger Minsc and the wychlaran he's sworn to guard, Dynaheir, have agreed to help me in my efforts to lay Caelar low. If I dismiss them, they will travel with the Flaming Fist to their camp at Coast Way Crossing.~
@59699 = ~Hold on a bit longer, friend. ~
@59700 = ~Recruitment Drive

Safana has joined my company.

I seemed to have contacted Safana at an opportune time. After some troubles with Coran, she is anxious to be away from her lover and the city both. She will join me on the journey to Dragonspear. If I dismiss Safana, she will travel with the Flaming Fist to their camp at Coast Way Crossing.~
@59701 = ~Recruitment Drive

Safana hasn't joined my party yet.

I couldn't convince the she-scoundrel Safana to join me on the journey to Dragonspear. That may be for the best; she clearly has unresolved issues with her lover, Coran. If I want to find her again, she is upstairs in the Elfsong Tavern.~
@59702 = ~Who?~ [BD34963]

I need to find Bridgefort. There I can scout the situation with the fort and the crusader camp.

The Flaming Fist has made camp near Boareskyr Bridge. I can either try to make contact with Bridgefort's defenders, or investigate the crusader camp at Bridgefort's front gate. Should I encounter the enemy, I've been warned not to use my real name, lest I draw unwanted attention.~

Jaheira has joined my party, and Voghiln has struck out for the Flaming Fist camp.

I was surprised to encounter my friend Jaheira in the woods near Bridgefort. She and a group of worthy souls have fought the crusaders besieging the fort for weeks. Jaheira has joined my party. I sent her friend (for lack of a better term), the Luskan skald Voghiln, back to the Flaming Fist camp. He doesn't strike me as someone you want for any task that may require even a modicum of subtlety.~
@59736 = ~The Bridgefort Defenders

Voghiln has joined my party, and Jaheira has struck out for the Flaming Fist camp.

I met the druid Jaheira in the woods around Bridgefort. She and her compatriots have fought the crusaders besieging the fort for weeks. I sent most of her party to the Flaming Fist encampment, but allowed one of them, a Luskan skald named Voghiln, to remain with me.~
@59737 = ~The Bridgefort Defenders

Jaheira and Voghiln have joined my party.

In the woods around Bridgefort, I met the druid, Jaheira, who, along with a handful of worthy souls, has fought the crusaders besieging the fort for weeks. I sent most of her allies to the Flaming Fist camp, but she and the Luskan skald, Voghiln, will remain with me for now.~
@59738 = ~The Bridgefort Defenders

Jaheira and Voghiln have struck out for the Flaming Fist camp.

In the woods around Bridgefort, I met the druid, Jaheira, who, along with a handful of worthy souls, has fought the crusaders besieging the fort for weeks. I sent them to the Flaming Fist camp for food and water. For myself, I will continue explore the area around the fort.~
@59739 = ~Voghiln the Mighty

I've met a skald named Voghiln.

There once was a skald named Voghiln,
Who probably could've turned our meeting into a limerick of dubious taste. 
But I'm not Voghiln, which is, I think, for the best.~
@59740 = ~Voghiln the Mighty

I've met a skald named Voghiln.

The Luskan skald Voghiln has joined my party. This should be interesting. If the man can fight as well as he can talk, we may be the rulers of the Underdark in short order.~
@59741 = ~The Bridgefort Defenders

Neera has joined me in my travels.

I found Neera the wild mage in a Bridgefort cell. Her powers could make her a helpful ally, or a dangerous liability. Nevertheless I asked her to join me. Hopefully I'll not have cause to regret it.~
@59742 = ~The Bridgefort Defenders

Neera the wild mage has gone to the Flaming Fist camp.

I found Neera the wild mage in a Bridgefort cell. Her powers could make her a helpful ally, or a dangerous liability. Rather than risk harming Bridgefort, I sent her to the Flaming Fist encampment. Hopefully she can do less damage there.~
@59743 = ~The Bridgefort Defenders

The half-orc Dorn Il-Khan has joined me.

Dorn bears a grudge against Caelar and her crusade. I'm not certain I can trust him, but I need powerful allies if I am to prevail against the Shining Lady. If I dismiss Dorn, he will wait for me at the Flaming Fist camp.~
@59744 = ~The Bridgefort Defenders

Dorn will join my allies at the Flaming Fist camp.

Caelar's followers held a half-orc, Dorn Il-Khan, prisoner, but his desire to end the crusade preceded his time in the cage. I'm not certain I can trust him, but I've sent him to the Flaming Fist. They can lock him up again if need be.~
@59745 = ~Important Events

I managed to talk my way past the crusade siege camp's perimeter guard. Now to see what their camp looks like.~
@59746 = ~Important Events

I fought my way through the crusade siege camp's perimeter guard. Now to see what's going on inside.~
@59747 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I have some time to scout the crusader camp, but should leave soon to find a way inside Bridgefort.

I followed Corwin's advice and escaped the crusade's cage without alerting the camp. We now have a chance to explore the area unchallenged. How long that will last, I don't know~
@59748 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

Boareskyr Bridge has been magically warded and I can't cross it.

There will be no sneaking across Boareskyr Bridge. A crusade magician named Oloneiros has warded the bridge against those who would thwart Caelar's will.~
@59749 = ~What is it?~ [BD59749]
@59750 = ~<CHARNAME>, this wizard knows who you are! I overheard her talking about you! Quick, make an excuse and let's go.~ [BD59750]

@59760 = ~Any sign of the Bhaalspawn yet?~
@59761 = ~Important Events

I made contact with the defenders at Bridgefort. Presently I'll speak to their leader, Khalid, and get a better idea of how this standoff is going.~
@59762 = ~The Battle for Bridgefort

I must talk to Wynan Hess and Jegg Hillcarver inside Bridgefort.

Bridgefort is in desperate straits. Khalid is marshaling his forces expertly, but the defenders are simply outnumbered. I need to find a way to break this siege, either by negotiating a surrender or by attacking the crusader camp with the Flaming Fist at my back. 

Khalid recommended that I first speak with Wynan Hess, a wizard inside of Bridgefort, who knows the state of the fort's defense. He also suggested I speak with Jegg Hillcarver, the smith inside the fort, regarding the supplies the crusaders are after.~
@59763 = ~It's time to attack, Khalid. The Flaming Fist stand ready to join us.~
@59764 = ~The Battle for Bridgefort

I've decided to try to negotiate a surrender. It seems the best way to end this conflict with as little loss of life as possible.~
@59765 = ~The Battle for Bridgefort

I've decided to take the battle to the enemy. With the Flaming Fist and the defenders of Bridgefort united, victory is assured.~
@59766 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I must secure the western bridge.

We've negotiated a surrender with the crusade. This ensures the defenders' survival, and we destroyed most of the supplies that would help the crusade. While the defenders leave the area, I must get to the bridge and secure it so that the Flaming Fist can proceed to Dragonspear Castle.~
@59767 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

My next task is to defeat the crusade forces.

The crusaders believe we're about to surrender. They're about to get an unpleasant surprise. Once we've defeated the enemy, we can press on to Dragonspear Castle.~
@59768 = ~The Battle for Bridgefort

I must secure the western bridge.

One of Caelar's mages was unwilling to let me walk free. She claimed Caelar had "plans" for me. The Barghest struck the mage down, but I still find the whole situation curious. The bridge remains open for the time being, but I must ensure it remains so. The Flaming Fist need it to reach Dragonspear Castle.~
@59769 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

My next task is to defeat the crusade forces.

The terms of surrender I negotiated with the Barghest didn't last for long. The crusader force under his command must be eliminated before I can continue on towards Dragonspear Castle.~
@59770 = ~The Battle for Bridgefort

Caelar's crusaders may be religious zealots, but the Barghest, at least, is a man of honor. The people of Bridgefort are freed, though not without cost.~
@59771 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I must stop the wizard on the bridge from detonating the barrels.

I must act quickly to stop Caelar's minions from destroying Boareskyr Bridge as they did Coast Way Crossing. One of their wizards is performing a spell, likely in an effort to detonate explosives on the bridge.~
@59772 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I should speak with Bence and find out what our next move is.

Fortunately, I was able to save Boareskyr Bridge from destruction. Now I'll return to the crusade siege camp to discuss our next move against Caelar's crusade with my allies.~
@59773 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

My next step is to defeat the crusade forces.

The battle for Bridgefort has begun! The crusaders laying siege to the fort must be eliminated before I can continue on towards my confrontation with Caelar Argent.~
@59774 = ~Disturbing Implications

I should keep watch for another appearance of the hooded man.

Once again, I encountered the strange hooded man. I blacked out while crossing Boareskyr Bridge and awoke lying in a scorched symbol of Bhaal. The hooded man claimed to have saved my life and said my power could be contained, or extracted. He also warned me that Caelar was not what she seemed. That much I had suspected.~
@59775 = ~The Battle for Bridgefort

The time has come to assault the crusader camp. With the Flaming Fist supporting me, we should be able to kill the crusaders and free the defenders of Bridgefort. To arms!~
@59776 = ~The Bridgefort Defenders

My companions will travel with me or to the Flaming Fist camp.

Now that I've recruited as many allies as I can in Bridgefort, it's time to engage in the final battle. After the fighting is done, any allies not currently with me will travel to the siege camp outside Dragonspear Castle. Likewise, any allies I dismiss from my party after Bridgefort will travel to the siege camp outside Dragonspear Castle.~
@59777 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I must go to the command tent in the south of camp and meet with the commanders.

We have reached the coalition forces' camp. I must locate the command tent to learn of the crusade's most recent moves. Caelar's time on Toril nears an end. With the forces of the Waterdeep City Guard, the Flaming Fist, and the Daggerford militia at our disposal, success is assured.~
@59778 = ~The Bridgefort Defenders

The Bridgefort siege has ended thanks to me and my companions.

I met several potential allies while defending Bridgefort, some more trustworthy than others. I had to decide who should join me in my quest. I think I made the best decisions possible.~
@59779 = ~M'Khiin Grubdoubler

M'Khiin's presence is not entirely welcome in camp.

We've reached the coalition forces' camp. Marshal Nederlok of the Flaming Fist is concerned about M'Khiin's presence. I must keep a close eye on her and ensure she's not interfered with.~
@59780 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

My next step is to find the entrance to the underground caverns nearby.

I have now met the Daggerford and Waterdhavian commanders, in addition to the Flaming Fist Marshal, Kyrill Nederlok. They have asked me to seek out a cavern system that leads up into Dragonspear Castle. If I can get into the castle, I'm to learn what I can of Caelar and her closest adviser, the Revered Brother Hephernaan.~
@59781 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

Torsin de Lancie wants me to meet with a dwarf named Phossey Dugdeep.

I have been bid by Waterdeep Torsin Cedric de Lancie to seek out the dwarf Phossey Dugdeep in a tent near the camp entrance.~
@59782 = ~Skie's Gone Missing

I should look for Skie Silvershield.

Skie Silvershield should be with the coalition forces here in camp, but Marshal Nederlok is having trouble finding her. I hope she isn't in any trouble, at least no more than usual.~
@59783 = ~Skie's Gone Missing

I need to track Skie down around Dragonspear Castle.

Skie Silvershield has fled the coalition's siege camp. I must find her before she falls into enemy hands. She was last seen heading towards Dragonspear Castle.~
@59784 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

My orders are to use the Stone Dowser amulet to find a drop spot and then place a barrel of Bwoosh! there.

When I locate the caverns beneath Dragonspear, Torsin de Lancie would have me do more than simply investigate Hephernaan, Caelar, and the crusade. I've been given a barrel of Bwoosh! (as the dwarf Phossey Dugdeep calls it), and a pendant called the Stone Dowser. I am to follow the amulet's guidance to a point beneath the castle and leave the barrel there, for strategic detonation during a future battle with the Caelar's minions.~
@59785 = ~Important Events

De Lancie also asked that I poison the crusade's food and water supplies. I've agreed to do so.~
@59786 = ~Entering Dragonspear Castle

I need to find one of Caelar's seals to enter Dragonspear Castle.

It appears I'll need a seal of Caelar if I'm to enter Dragonspear without drawing attention to myself. If I can find a crusader patrol, perhaps they'll have one on their persons.~
@59787 = ~Entering Dragonspear Castle

I can explore Dragonspear Castle's courtyard so long as I am cautious.

I convinced the guards to grant me entrance to Dragonspear Castle. I must be careful while inside. My true name and purpose must remain a secret; I will have to play the role of crusader at all times.~
@59788 = ~Skie's Gone Missing

Skie is safe from the crusaders.

I found Skie Silvershield under attack from crusader mercenaries. Thankfully I arrived in time to save her.~
@59789 = ~Skie's Gone Missing

I'll need to inform Marshal Nederlok that Skie is safe.

Apparently life with the Flaming Fist is "hard" and "boring"; Skie Silvershield took it on herself to scout the enemy position. Her father made a grave error letting her leave Baldur's Gate. She's safe for the moment and claims she's heading back to camp. I'll let Marshal Nederlok know.~
@59790 = ~Disturbing Implications

Once again, I was confronted by the man who hides his face in the shadows of his hood. He scolded me, demanding I stop listening to dukes and generals and head straight to Caelar. Would that I could, but there's no way I can breach Dragonspear's defenses alone.~
@59791 = ~Disturbing Implications

The strange guy who watched me while I slept thinks I may have a future free of Bhaal. But will I have a future free of him? I'd like to know more about this man and what he intends, but he always disappears before I can truly question him.~
@59792 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

If I find something for the ogres to drink, they'll lift me up to Dragonspear's basement.

I need to find the ogre Einer something to drink so he'll convey me up to Dragonspear Castle's basement. Failing that I must find some way to convince the ogres to let me up.~
@59793 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I can now search Dragonspear Castle's basement for information.

Glint's cousin Rhonda managed to convince the ogres running the lift up to Dragonspear to send us up. I don't know how much time and effort that saved me, but it's probably a lot.~
@59794 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I can now search Dragonspear Castle's basement for information.

I returned to the ogres with some liquor. My gift was accepted and I will now be hoisted up to the Dragonspear Castle basement and back.~
@59795 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I must defend myself against Hephernaan's attack.

A shadowy serpent coils beneath the skin of Caelar's light. Its name is Hephernaan, and who, or what, he serves is dark indeed.~
@59796 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I should return to camp and check in with the commanders.

Something strange is going on. Caelar offered to end the siege in exchange for my surrendering myself for a few days. When I refused, negotiations ended quickly. Perhaps the commanders have some insight into Caelar's purpose.~
@59797 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I should return to camp and check in with the commanders.

Something strange is going on. Caelar offered to end the siege in exchange for my surrendering myself for a few days. I was willing to try it, for the good of all, but the coalition commanders fear some treachery on her part and rejected the offer. I can speak with them back at camp.~
@59798 = ~Important Events

I must meet the commanders back at the coalition camp to prepare for battle.

The coalition's final assault on Dragonspear Castle is imminent. I will rendezvous with the commanders back at the camp, where we will decide my role in the coming battle.~
@59799 = ~Important Events

It's time for us to invade the courtyard of Dragonspear Castle.

With the initial attack dealt with, the time has come to take this battle to Dragonspear Castle. Caelar's crusade is at an end. Our first task is to find a way through the outer gates.~
@59800 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I must find and speak with Phossey Dugdeep.

Without the barrel of Bwoosh! placed, we can't blow up the gates. Hopefully, Phossey Dugdeep can penetrate the walls from above ground. I'm to seek her out to the east of Dragonspear's main gate.~
@59801 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

Now I can enter Dragonspear Castle.

The barrel of Bwoosh! did as Phossey Dugdeep promised. Dragonspear's main gate has fallen before us.~
@59802 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I must defeat all the archers so that Phossey can set up her explosives.

By clearing the area of archers, I can buy Phossey Dugdeep the time she needs to set up her explosives.~
@59803 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I should enter the Dragonspear courtyard and defeat Caelar's commanders.

With my assistance, Phossey Dugdeep's made an entrance into Dragonspear's outer courtyard. Now I will find Caelar and end her crusade, once and for all time. I should look for her commanders, the ones at the parley. If I defeat them I can break the back of the crusade.~
@59804 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I left the trolls penned up, though I can always return and release them to create havoc.

I didn't want to leave the troll penned up like that, but perhaps a wild troll running amok isn't a good idea at the moment. ~
@59805 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I freed the trolls to wreak vengeance on the crusaders.

The crusaders stole the trolls from their homes and used them for shock troops. Now the trolls are free, and the crusade will pay the price for its slaver ways.~
@59806 = ~Important Events

Use the catapult to open the gates.

The crusaders have a catapult on hand. If I get control of the machine, we can use it to blast the castle gates open and allow our allies in. ~
@59807 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

Nederlok suggests I find the crusader Ashatiel and put an end to her.

The crusaders keep coming, and our troops are struggling to make progress. I need to find a way to stem the tide. An old proverb comes to mind: "Cut the head off the snake, and the body dies." Perhaps if I kill their commander, the crusaders will retreat.~
@59808 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I should look for Bence Duncan by the inner courtyard gates.

I've defeated Adras Ashatiel. With the commander dead, the crusade forces appear to be in flight. I should regroup with the commanders near the inner courtyard gates.~
@59809 = ~Important Events

Find the commanders by the inner courtyard gates.

The coalition has successfully taken the Dragonspear Castle's outer courtyard. I will meet the siege commanders at the inner courtyard gates to commence our final assault on Caelar's stronghold.~
@59810 = ~Important Events

Find a way into the castle from the roof.

Caelar's forces retreat to Dragonspear's roof, which I suspect holds the entrance to the castle proper. I need to find a way up and take care of any crusaders who try to block my path.~
@59811 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

Daeros Dragonspear's ghost told me Hephernaan has a plot of his own.

I met the ghost of Daeros Dragonspear, who tells me Hephernaan is not the loyal servant of Caelar he pretends to be. He wants to open a portal to the Nine Hells, and he needs divine blood to do it. Caelar's is too diluted. I suspect mine is what he's after.~
@59812 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I must use the portal to enter Avernus.

I have no choice but to venture into Avernus and find a way to seal the portal between planes.~
@59813 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

The whole plan is now clear to me.

This whole hideous plan has become clear. Caelar never wanted me dead; those "assassins" in the Ducal Palace used sleep poison because they were to steal my blood. Caelar needed divine blood to open a portal to Avernus, in the Nine Hells, to rescue the spirits of the Dragonspear Wars. Her right-hand man, Hephernaan, has his own agenda, though. Now I must stop them both and find a way to seal this portal before there's a third Dragonspear War.~
@59814 = ~Well, it should be fun for SOMEone, at any rate. Watch out!~ [BD59814]
@59815 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

My goal is to advance to the stone tower and find Caelar.

I met a group of wounded crusaders in Avernus. They followed Caelar through the portal but were quickly overwhelmed. Caelar went on without the bulk of her troops, leaving them to the devils while she pressed on to the black stone tower in the distance.~
@59816 = ~Escorting the Crusaders

The truth about Caelar Argent's crusade is revealed. For all that her noble rhetoric about rescuing the souls of the Dragonspear Wars dead, she really sought to free her uncle, Aun Argent, imprisoned in Hell after she experimented with dark magic beyond her power. Now Belhifet intends to claim her soul as well. If I can slay him and save Caelar, disaster may yet be averted.~

If I can defeat these unholy allies, the portal to Dragonspear can be closed yet.~
@59850 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

Aun Argent is free and Caelar lives.

Aun Argent has sacrificed himself to close the portal to Avernus.

@59855 = ~Disturbing Implications

@59856 = ~Skie's Grand Plan

It's possible that I killed Skie Silvershield.

In the end, it was not Caelar or her crusade Skie Silvershield needed to fear, but a dagger seemingly wielded by my own hand. Did I truly kill her? It seems impossible to me, yet the evidence is difficult to refute.~

It's obvious that Corwin doubts my story, though my guilt or innocence concerns her less than the well-being of Baldur's Gate. She would have me admit to murder to spare the city further hardship, regardless of whether I committed the act.~
@59859 = ~Disturbing Implications

@59942 = ~As long as I get the payment we agreed to, you can say anything you like. ~
@59943 = ~Of course. 5 gold pieces, I believe it was? Here you go. ~
@59944 = ~That's terrible! I was afraid something bad might happen. For you to cover my earnings, though—only a real hero would do such a thing. I don't care what the rumors say—you're a good person, and I'll say as much to anyone who dares claim otherwise. ~

@59952 = ~What will I do? Gods help me now—no one else will. You've let me down, "hero." And I'll let everyone know about it. ~

@59990 = ~You've had a hard lesson this day. Learn from it, and move on.~

@59994 = ~What did this holy symbol look like?~
@59995 = ~As I said, Lon was staring at the symbol when I polished it this morning—couldn't take his eyes off it. He must have seen me put it in my pack's hidden pocket—there's no other way anyone could find it.~

@60020 = ~Lon, would you consent to being searched, to see if you carry the amulet upon your person?~
@60021 = ~But you didn't actually see him take it. You'll need more evidence before I accept Lon's guilt.~

@60176 = ~Sarn! Look at the carvings on those doors. A sign would have been simpler. "Do not enter."~ [BD60176]

@60178 = ~The aphotic energy those doors emit is unsettling in the extreme...~ [BD60178]

@60182 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I need to escape Dragonspear Castle and check in with de Lancie.

I was able to poison Caelar's food and water supplies. The crusade will get an unpleasant surprise when the battle for Dragonspear begins in earnest.~
@60183 = ~A passerby, nothing more. I shall leave you.~
@60184 = ~Halt! This crossing belongs to Caelar Argent. Who are you to seek passage over her bridge?~
@60185 = ~Hold on a moment. Are you...? You are...!~

@60235 = ~Thank the gods. I don't know what Duke Silvershield would have done if anything happened to his daughter. I appreciate you taking care of this, <CHARNAME>. Here's a small reward for your efforts.~ [BD60235]
@60236 = ~I'll be leaving soon, unless something else catches my attention here. Do you know of anything that might catch my attention?~
@60237 = ~I thought I'd report back to you first. I've dealt with that thieves' guild.~
@60238 = ~Schael Corwin

I could try to speak with this man from Corwin's past.

I need to know what happened between Corwin and this man she recognized. Ignorance is dangerous in a place like this.~
@60239 = ~Schael Corwin

I need to decide whether to talk to Famari and try to learn something useful, or to stay away from him for safety's sake.

It seems Beno Famari, the father of Captain Corwin's daughter, Rohma, is both alive and fighting alongside the crusade. Corwin finds neither circumstance agreeable, but wishes to avoid an incident. I believe I might be able to get some intelligence from Famari if I have Corwin talk to him. Or I might blow our cover.~
@60240 = ~Schael Corwin

I've finished with Beno Famari.

I spoke with Beno Famari without alerting him to our real purpose here. I understand Corwin's reticence to speak with the man; he is a detestable creature.~
@60241 = ~Schael Corwin

I've finished with Beno Famari.

I was able to speak with Beno Famari and, more importantly, keep Corwin from killing the man. Again. I didn't uncover much more information, but I do know the attack will come after Caelar and Hephernaan finish some sort of business they have in the castle. If or when I can sneak into Dragonspear, I should keep watch for this Hephernaan. Perhaps his activities will give me a clue as to what Caelar's plan is.~
@60242 = ~Schael Corwin

I've finished with Beno Famari.

Now I understand Corwin's reticence to speak with Beno Famari. He is a truly detestable creature. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to assuage his suspicions, and he attacked me. I need to beat a strategic retreat.~
@60243 = ~Mizhena? That's an unusual name. I don't think I've heard it before.~

@60246 = ~How did you invent this new name for yourself?~
@60247 = ~That's very interesting. Let's talk about something else.~
@60248 = ~I have to be going now.~
@60249 = ~When I was born, my parents thought me a boy and raised me as such. In time, we all came to understand I was truly a woman. I created my new name from syllables of different languages. All have special meaning to me; it is the truest reflection of who I am.~ [BD60249]
@60250 = ~Thank you for sharing your story with me. I have another question for you.~
@60251 = ~An interesting past. Now I must ask you something else.~

@60253 = ~Here, eat these berries. They might make you feel better.~
@60254 = ~Here, eat these berries. They'll help you.~
@60255 = ~I have something you asked me to find.~

@60258 = ~On the Fence~
@60259 = ~On the Fence

Waizahb, a fence at the coalition siege camp, will pay good money for five items from the crusader camp.

A commander named Dreon wears a signet ring Waizahb wants. He's reputedly hard to talk to. I'll need to find a way to get him to trust me.

A chest somewhere in the camp contains a battle standard.

One of the crusaders is a cleric of the Red Knight and has a holy symbol with rubies for eyes. That's sure to be noticed if it goes missing. I might have to find some sort of replacement.

Some new recruits have taken to carrying homemade tokens of their devotion to Caelar. I need to find one.

In the camp hangs a map of the crusade's progress. It's annotated in Caelar's own writing. That shouldn't be hard to find.~
@60260 = ~I definitely don't speak to recruits out of uniform. You're an embarrassment to the crusade, looking like that. Dismissed.~
@60261 = ~And you shouldn't open your mouth if you intend to speak with it.~ [BD60261]
@60262 = ~On the Fence

As I find the items on my list I should bring them to Waizahb in camp.

I obtained Commander Dreon's signet ring. I assumed the thought of honest work would scare him into turning over the ring, and I was correct.~

...Many spells exist which can tear a subject's spirit from its body, or its remains. Magic jar is one such spell, an incantation which traps a creature's spirit in an object until it can inhabit a new host. Certain magic items can be crafted to contain a soul, some of them enchanted so the holder of the container (be it a jar, a casket, a locket, or some other enclosed object) has power over the soul within. A spirit so trapped has no choice but to obey its captor until the item breaks or it is otherwise released...~

@60407 = ~A pathetic attempt! Your tricks are wasted here!~
@60408 = ~Arrows! Lightning from the heavens could not stop us, and you assail us with arrows? Standing against Caelar was your first mistake—you just made your last!~
@60409 = ~Magic against magic, spell for spell—Caelar cannot be stopped, and neither can her loyal servants! Slay them all!~
@60410 = ~You heard <PRO_HIMHER>! Stain the ground red with the wizards' blood!~
@60411 = ~Slayers! Beware, the fiends send wizard slayers against us!~

@60413 = ~The crusaders' magic is too powerful! I don't know how much more of this we can take!~

@60416 = ~There's no time for rest, <CHARNAME>—you need to get back to Andrus. Make sure the crusade doesn't break through elsewhere.~

@60423 = ~We'll do what we can, <CHARNAME>. I pray it will be enough.~
@60424 = ~We'll give them everything we've got. If they're still standing after that—well, I'll leave the backup plan to you.~
@60425 = ~Lead the way, <CHARNAME>. We'll follow your lead.~
@60426 = ~It is time the crusaders felt the full force of our fury. Forward!~

@60428 = ~It's past time the crusaders tasted our steel. When you say the word, we strike.~

@60431 = ~Only the gods may judge mortals, crusader. Not Caelar Argent, and certainly not you.~

@60436 = ~I'll gladly pay that price, but all I've got is a gold piece—I'll be needing some change.~
@60437 = ~There will be a price paid in blood this day, crusader... YOUR blood!~

@60442 = ~All right, boys, let's finish this lot off quickly an' it's back to my tent for a mug of warm ale!~
@60443 = ~Those shields are catching most of our arrows. We're going to run out of ammunition before we even see Dragonspear!~
@60444 = ~There's certainly no place for fear in our enemies' hearts. I can't do much to hold them, <CHARNAME>.~
@60445 = ~Damn it all! There's so many of them—killing them's like trying to hold onto sand.~
@60446 = ~I thought we were done for, <CHARNAME>, but you thwarted the crusade at every turn. Now check on Andrus and see how she's doing.~

@60453 = ~WHAT?! I am Grimgor, commander of Caelar's elite! Who dares question me—?~

@60461 = ~It's not too late to run, Grimgor. You still have a chance to survive this.~ [BD60461]
@60462 = ~This is bad, very bad. Half the camp's on fire, the crusade's closing in on all sides, and Dugdeep did—I don't know what she did! Whatever it was, it's preventing me from neutralizing the explosives!~ [BD60462]
@60463 = ~Is there anything I can do?~
@60464 = ~Can we use the barrels against the crusade?~
@60465 = ~Cease your whining, mage. This battle is far from over.~
@60466 = ~I need healing.~
@60467 = ~Keep the crusade away from me and the barrels as long as you can. I'll keep trying to stabilize the explosives.~ [BD60467]
@60468 = ~I'll do whatever I can for you.~

@60479 = ~I think I might.~
@60480 = ~Woman, man, or god, I kneel before nothing and no one, you noxious beast.~
@60481 = ~There is no place for doubt in Caelar's army, hero of Baldur's Gate. Oh yes, Grimgor recognizes you. Your head will make a worthy trophy.~
@60482 = ~Those who won't kneel will fall.~
@60483 = ~The crusaders have pushed us back too far! We've lost this section—retreat to the bonfire!~

in my mind, leaving me adrift and in a daze.
The glaciers of the north, in sun with diamond gleam,
fade to nothing when I meet your lovely gaze.

No delicate flower, no pale and shrinking beauty
is thy charm. Like a she-wolf on the plains,
you strike at your prey, tearing away my heart
and leaving me in thrall to love's fierce pains...~

@60499 = ~Sometimes "not so good" is the best we can be if we want to accomplish our goals.~
@60500 = ~That's true enough. I suspect things are going to get worse before they get better.~
@60501 = ~That sounds close to an ultimatum, Minsc. Dangerously close.~
@60502 = ~What of it? If villainy is the cost of victory, it's a price I'm happy to pay.~
@60503 = ~Many thanks. You have made Boo a very happy hamster!~
@60504 = ~There is good and there is evil. Boo knows the difference. The hamster's eyes are upon you. Do not disappoint him.~
@60505 = ~You make Boo unhappy. Boo unhappy makes Minsc angry.~
@60506 = ~Witch! Come with Minsc. I must get you away from this pack of dogs before they start to bite.~
@60507 = ~Thou walkest a dark path, <CHARNAME>. Be careful, lest thou art lost.~
@60508 = ~Come, Boo! This scoundrel is no fit company for a miniature giant space hamster.~
@60509 = ~No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! Boo has had all he can stand; he can stand no more! What you do is wrong, <CHARNAME>! It is evil! Boo is mad as hell! He will take it no more—nor will I!~ [BD60509]
@60510 = ~I'm truly sorry it's come to this, my friend.~
@60511 = ~Are you sure, Minsc? You will be sorely missed.~
@60512 = ~Go, then. I'll be better off without you and that high-handed rodent's distorted morality interfering with my business.~
@60513 = ~You'll take whatever I see fit to give and you'll like it, madman.~
@60514 = ~Look at Boo. His miniature giant space heart is breaking. But we can no longer be a part of this. Farewell.~
@60515 = ~There is no choice in this. You have done as you will, Boo and I will do as we must.~
@60516 = ~You mock Boo's judgment? Count yourself lucky he is a merciful soul. Were it otherwise, you would answer to me. ~
@60517 = ~You call Minsc mad? Well, maybe I am, a little, but Boo sees things clearly. And what he sees in you, he will no longer abide.~
@60518 = ~There will come a time when thou shalt regret this, <CHARNAME>, sooner than you think. Come, Minsc, let us leave this miscreant to <PRO_HISHER> fate.~
@60519 = ~I need to speak with thee, <CHARNAME>. I am growing... concerned, with things thou hast done, and others thou hast allowed. There is a line 'twixt good and evil, and thou art perilously close to crossing it.~ [BD60519]
@60520 = ~Thank you for sharing your concerns with me, Dynaheir. You're right, of course. I will try to change—just be patient with me, I beg you.~
@60521 = ~There are times evil is the most efficient method to achieve the greater good.~
@60522 = ~I kind of think I crossed that line a long time ago...~
@60523 = ~What you call evil, I call convenient. If you've a problem with that, get over it, or get the hells away from me.~
@60524 = ~You think to judge me, witch? No, no, I'll not allow it. Begone.~
@60525 = ~There is a darkness within thee. Thou must be ever watchful, or as surely as night follows day, it will consume thee. I would not see this happen, but ultimately, thou art the only one who can prevent it.~
@60526 = ~Hah! Who is this speaking to me now? Is it thou, <CHARNAME>, or Caelar? I am certain she would justify herself in much the same way.~
@60527 = ~This is nothing to laugh at. Heed my words. There is darkness within thee. If thou art not careful, it will consume thee. I would not see this happen, but only thou can prevent it. If thou wouldst embrace it, I will have no choice but to leave thy side. Do not doubt me. I'll not warn thee again.~
@60528 = ~If that is thy choice, I shall respect it. Fare thee well.~
@60529 = ~Look at Boo. His miniature giant space heart is breaking. But we can no longer be a part of this. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>.~
@60530 = ~Thou wouldst see me go? Very well. But mark my words, child of Bhaal—thou shalt regret this.~
@60531 = ~I warned thee, <CHARNAME>. I told thee what would happen if thou continued down this dark path, but thou wouldn't listen, and now I have no choice but to leave.~ [BD60531]
@60532 = ~Your words did not go unheard, Dynaheir. I simply wasn't able to do as you wished. For that, I am truly sorry.~
@60533 = ~There's always a choice.~
@60534 = ~I'm sorry, did you say something? I wasn't listening.~
@60535 = ~Go, then. You'll not be missed.~
@60536 = ~As am I. But regrets change nothing. What's done is done. I must go.~
@60537 = ~How can you do this, <CHARNAME>? Look at Boo. His miniature giant space heart is breaking, for he knows we must leave you now. Goodbye.~
@60538 = ~Indeed. And with thine actions, thou hast made mine for me.~
@60539 = ~Thine arrogance will be your downfall. But I'll not stand helpless and watch thee cast aside the gifts the gods gave thou.~
@60540 = ~<CHARNAME>? May I have a moment of your time? I need to speak with you about the things we have done of late. I am... not comfortable with some of our actions.~ [BD60540]
@60541 = ~I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to ease this distress?~
@60542 = ~You think I am?~
@60543 = ~I advise you to get comfortable with them, monk. I'll do what must be done to see this through. I don't care to have you standing over me in judgment as I do so.~
@60544 = ~We live in a dark world. If we're to survive, we must be darker still.~
@60545 = ~There is. I just ask that, in future, we both take a moment to reflect upon what we are doing, and why. There is evil enough in this world. I do not wish to add to it. That is all.~
@60546 = ~I must admit I had not considered that possibility. If we are of one mind on this, there should be no problems going forward. We must simply take a moment to consider what we do and why, before we do it. There is enough evil in this world, without us adding to it.~
@60547 = ~I did not know you felt this way. I do not wish to judge you, my friend, but I cannot simply watch and do nothing as you embrace evil. I fear this is where our paths diverge. Farewell.~
@60548 = ~I had hoped it would never come to this, my friend, and yet it has. The time has come for us to part ways. In truth, the time came and went long ago.~ [BD60548]
@60549 = ~I feared this time would come, though I dared to hope it wouldn't. I know you cannot accept the things I do, Rasaad. I hope you can accept I have no choice but to do as I have. You should go, my friend—go before we are friends no more.~
@60550 = ~You're leaving? Why?~
@60551 = ~Less talking. More leaving.~
@60552 = ~Begone then. Go, now. The stench of your hypocrisy churns my stomach. I'll endure it no longer.~
@60553 = ~The principles of the Sun Soul order do not permit me to remain. What we have done, what you clearly intend to continue doing, it is wrong. I cannot be a part of it. I am sorry, but I must leave. Farewell.~
@60554 = ~May Selûne's light shine upon you, <CHARNAME>. Goodbye.~
@60555 = ~I shall pray for you, my friend. May Selûne's light shine upon you, always.~
@60556 = ~This isn't how I like to attract attention.~ [BD60556]
@60557 = ~I'm sorry to hear that.~
@60558 = ~I thought you always liked attention. Good or bad.~
@60559 = ~Really? You always struck me as the sort of person who liked being bad.~
@60560 = ~You're also boring. Boring me, at least.~
@60561 = ~Find someone who cares and tell them about it.~
@60562 = ~Then DO something about it. I like rough edges, but not so many that I'm likely to wind up in a Flaming Fist cell. Shape up soon, or I'll find someone else to travel with.~
@60563 = ~You say the words, but what will you do to act upon them? Nothing, most like. If you keep dragging my name down in the mud, I'm warning you, I'll not stand for it.~
@60564 = ~That's not true. The company I keep should make me look better, like a gold setting makes a diamond shine more brightly. But with you, I may have made a mistake. ~
@60565 = ~I enjoy being naughty. But I don't like having my name dragged through the mud. I thought you understood that, but I'm starting to wonder.~
@60566 = ~Ah! Your tongue is sharper than a dagger, your words more venomous than a serpent's bite. You'd better be nicer to me—and everyone in general—or I'm out of here.~
@60567 = ~I'm leaving.~ [BD60567]
@60568 = ~I'm truly sorry to hear that.~
@60569 = ~You're leaving? Why in Toril would you want to do that?~
@60570 = ~I wish I could say I was surprised. You're always looking for the easy way out.~
@60571 = ~You aren't going anywhere. Don't be foolish.~
@60572 = ~When you decide to stop making us look like the worst heroes on the Sword Coast, let me know. Or don't. I can't honestly say I care, at this point. Farewell.~
@60573 = ~I AM going anywhere—anywhere else, that is. I was foolish to think you'd make me look glamorous and heroic. Now I know the truth. We are done.~
@60574 = ~Our goals are clearly incompatible. I seek excitement, danger, fun! And you, well...~
@60575 = ~I WAS looking for the fun way to stay in, but you put an end to THAT hope.~
@60576 = ~Your quirks begin to irritate, <CHARNAME>. You care too much for the judgment of others. It makes you weak.~ [BD60576]
@60577 = ~What others think of me means little. I am the one who must live with the consequences of my actions. I do what I think best for myself and the world.~
@60578 = ~Doing what is right makes me weak?~
@60579 = ~You think me weak, Viconia? Keep talking and I'll show you weakness.~
@60580 = ~That you even have to ask is evidence of this truth. Do as you will, <CHARNAME>, but know that I do not blindly follow in your footsteps. I am watching you, and I do not like what I see.~
@60581 = ~Pretty words do not change the facts. You have it in you to achieve great things—but you won't, not while you indulge this surface-dweller "nobility."~
@60582 = ~Hm. Perhaps I misjudged you.~
@60583 = ~I will take my leave of you now, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD60583]
@60584 = ~You don't have to do this, Viconia. I see virtue within you. You do yourself a disservice in suppressing it.~
@60585 = ~Why would you do that?~
@60586 = ~That would be a grave mistake.~
@60587 = ~Go, then. Do not even attempt to change that which perturbs you, just run from it. I expect no better from you.~
@60588 = ~Our goals, and the way we choose to pursue them, are too different. You strive always towards the light, while I prefer the shadows. If we remain together, neither of us will find what we seek. And so, I go.~
@60589 = ~You see what you want to see. I see things as they are. To thrive in darkness, you must embrace it, as I do, or be destroyed. I will not be destroyed, on your behalf or any other's.~
@60590 = ~So predictable... You will fight to your dying breath for the rivvise, but cannot wait to turn your back on the drow. It hurts my eyes to look at you, <CHARNAME>. Aluve'.~
@60591 = ~A mistake no greater than the one I made in accompanying you in the first place. I should have known better than to attempt to guide you to the wisdom of Shar, but you made me hope. I may never forgive you that. Aluve'.~
@60592 = ~I would have a word with you, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD60592]
@60593 = ~Of course, Edwin. What can I do for you?~
@60594 = ~Just one? That would be a pleasant change of pace.~
@60595 = ~I know what you're going to say, Edwin. We spend too much time living up to the expectations of others, and not enough in service to our own goals.~
@60596 = ~Do it quickly, then.~
@60597 = ~The monkey thinks it's clever. That is adorable. Consider your head patted. Now let us get on with this.~
@60598 = ~I mislike the path our little band is walking. The glory of Thay and my—I mean, OUR power... These are the things that matter. You neglect them. Do not think that has gone unnoticed. I will not tolerate it much longer.~
@60599 = ~You are perceptive, <CHARNAME>. Far more perceptive than these other monkeys. What you say is true.~
@60600 = ~Enough! I thought we had settled this, <CHARNAME>. But you continue to ignore my sage advice and champion the cause of whatever simpering chimpanzee stumbles across our path. Now, you will pay the price for your folly. Goodbye.~ [BD60600]
@60601 = ~I'm sorry we couldn't make this work out, Edwin. Farewell. I hope you find what you're looking for.~
@60602 = ~I've paid higher prices for dearer things. Goodbye, Edwin. I'd say you'll be missed, but on second thought, I won't say that at all.~
@60603 = ~Begone then, wretch. I have no further use of you.~
@60604 = ~Oh, I will. You may be certain of that.~
@60605 = ~I thought you better than the rest of the monkeys, <CHARNAME>. But when all is said and done, you reveal yourself as just another simian. I am disappointed, but not surprised.~
@60606 = ~A word to the wise, <CHARNAME>. Your heinous habit of defending the desperate and downtrodden doesn't do it for this drow. The demented determination to be a hero? It's wearing thin.~ [BD60606]
@60607 = ~I am sorry to hear that, Baeloth. But you must know I put a premium on preserving the public peace and am less perturbed by the pursuit of profit.~
@60608 = ~If it makes you feel better, think of what we do as a play. The people want heroes. I'm just giving them what they want.~
@60609 = ~Your comfort's really a concern of mine.~
@60610 = ~If you've a problem with the way I conduct myself, drow, you're always free to leave.~
@60611 = ~An elegant articulation of an unfortunately upright approach. An attitude adjustment is in order if you aim to retain the Entertainer. ~
@60612 = ~I am well aware of it. And if your altruistic aspirations aren't adapted as I've advised, you'll observe my evacuation in short order.~
@60613 = ~This nonchalant neglect gnawed at me before now, but this is more than even the Entertainer can endure. And so, aluve'.~
@60614 = ~You were warned once, <CHARNAME>, but that warning wasn't welcomed. And so we wind up with me walking away. Where? I know not. Somewhere without you.~ [BD60614]
@60615 = ~If that is your choice, I will respect it.~
@60616 = ~Is helping others really such a terrible burden, Baeloth?~
@60617 = ~Your exit is well timed, drow. Had you remained much longer, I would surely have slain you, or at least cut that endlessly wagging serpent tongue from your skull.~
@60618 = ~You will regret this decision. Baeloth. But I won't. Begone.~
@60619 = ~Don't try to stop me. My decision is determined. I will depart without delay.~
@60620 = ~A bigger burden than I am willing to bear. My decision is determined. I will depart without delay.~
@60621 = ~<CHARNAME>. These are difficult times, I know. Hard decisions must be made for the greater good. Even so, I will not stand silent in the face of your atrocious behavior.~
@60622 = ~I would not have stand silent, Jaheira. Certainly not when you've such valuable counsel to give.~
@60623 = ~You think I've gone too far?~
@60624 = ~I doubt you've stood silent in the face of anything in your life.~
@60625 = ~Then walk away, or better still run. You may not stand silent, but I can arrange it so you lie that way.~
@60626 = ~Mock me if you will. I care little what you think, it's what you do that matters. And what you have done recently offends me. If you continue down this road much farther, you'll do so without me at your side. I warn you now out of respect, but I'll not do so a second time.~
@60627 = ~Not so far that you cannot turn back. But that day is coming. And when it does, though it would pain me greatly, I will have no choice but to leave you to your fate. Don't make me do that. Please, don't.~
@60628 = ~Threatening my wife? You go too far, <CHARNAME>. And I tell you now, one of us will go no further. Defend yourself!~
@60629 = ~I will go, and gladly. I thought I might be able to bear the stench that surrounds you, but I'm happier not having to.~
@60630 = ~There may be hope for you yet.~
@60631 = ~I dared to hope you could save yourself, <CHARNAME>. I was a fool to do so. You have crossed a threshold from which you can never return. You are an agent of evil. I will not, I cannot be a party to that evil. ~
@60632 = ~I understand—though I'm sorry to see you go.~
@60633 = ~Your arrogance is astounding. Who are you to judge me?~
@60634 = ~I wondered how much longer you'd take it.~
@60635 = ~I despair for you, Jaheira. To think me evil is to display a profound, even disturbing, lack of imagination.~
@60636 = ~I am the one who is sorry. Your life is your own, you are what you decide to be. It saddens me to know you have chosen to be... this. Farewell, <CHARNAME>.~
@60637 = ~You have your answer. I hope it makes you happy. Farewell, <CHARNAME>.~
@60638 = ~G-goodbye, my friend. I must side with my b-beloved wife in this matter.~
@60639 = ~One who knows the difference between good and evil. One who knows which side of that line to walk and when. You are running headlong to your own doom. I'll not be there when you reach it.~
@60640 = ~You are running headlong to your own doom. I may not be able to save you, but I don't have to be there when you fall. Farewell.~
@60641 = ~I m-m-must tell you, some of the things we have done of late... they make me uncomfortable. Are we g-g-going to continue along this course?~ [BD60641]
@60642 = ~In truth, some of my recent acts weigh heavily upon my conscience. I will do everything in my power to ensure that doesn't happen going forward. Fair enough?~
@60643 = ~I don't want to make promises circumstances might stop me from keeping.~
@60644 = ~Till we reach the very end.~
@60645 = ~We will continue for as long as I choose. Do you have a problem with that?~
@60646 = ~I p-prithee reconsider, <CHARNAME>. If you d-don't, I fear we shall h-have to go our sep-separate ways. I do not w-want that. Do you?~
@60647 = ~These are t-trying times, I know—believe m-me, I know. But there is al-always a choice to be made. I f-fear we are making the wrong o-ones too often. If we would not be-become the thing we fight, we m-must be careful.~
@60648 = ~I c-can ask no more. Thank y-you.~
@60649 = ~I am truly sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I c-cannot go on with you.~ [BD60649]
@60650 = ~I am the one who should be sorry. I tried to live up to your expectations, Khalid, and I fell short. I hope someday you can forgive me.~
@60651 = ~Fare thee well, Khalid. You will be missed, but only because I'm a terrible shot.~
@60652 = ~I feared it would come to this. I had hoped you might be willing to overlook some of my faults for the greater good. I should have known better.~
@60653 = ~Back to the forest with you, then. We'll both be happier with you there.~
@60654 = ~No good can b-be b-b-born of evil. What has b-been done in your name cannot be j-justified. I will be a p-part of this no l-longer. Farewell.~
@60655 = ~Khalid is right. This cannot continue. Take care of yourself, <CHARNAME>. You walk a dark path. I fear where it may lead.~
@60656 = ~There is nothing to f-forgive. We are who w-we are. In the end, we are t-too different. Such is l-life. F-farewell.~
@60657 = ~Farewell.~
@60658 = ~Take care of yourself, <CHARNAME>. You walk a dark path. I fear where it may lead.~
@60659 = ~I d-don't understand. You w-wish to shoot me?~
@60660 = ~Forgive me. It was an attempt at a joke, but apparently it fell flat.~
@60661 = ~I hadn't at first, but that's starting to change...~
@60662 = ~Get out of here. Now.~
@60663 = ~You disappoint me, <CHARNAME>. I thought you sought power. Now I learn what you truly crave is the approval of those unworthy of notice, much less consideration.~ [BD60663]
@60664 = ~You are too quick to dismiss the common folk.~
@60665 = ~Sorry to disappoint you, Dorn. Wait, no I'm not. I'm not sorry at all.~
@60666 = ~You think it a weakness to have others believe there is goodness within me? Think again. Having the trust of others is a valuable thing. They never see what's coming until it's too late.~
@60667 = ~You say this as though your approval means something to me.~
@60668 = ~I promise that will change if you continue indulging the commoners. They are insects to be crushed underfoot, nothing more. Do not delude yourself into thinking otherwise.~
@60669 = ~They are insects to be crushed underfoot, nothing more. Do not delude yourself into thinking otherwise.~
@60670 = ~I'm impressed. You are more devious than I gave you credit for. But you should know that in revealing yourself, you have lost any chance you might have had to win my trust. I'm watching you, <CHARNAME>. For the moment? I like what I see.~
@60671 = ~You would do well to heed my words. Ignore them at your own peril. Ignore me, and you will come to regret it.~
@60672 = ~We are done, <CHARNAME>. Continue to debase yourself in service to the caprices of the weak if you wish. I'll not join you in servitude.~ [BD60672]
@60673 = ~You disappoint me, Dorn. Are you truly so blind as to believe there is no benefit in doing the right thing?~
@60674 = ~Really? I thought you rather liked serving the will of others.~
@60675 = ~Oh, come on. It's not as bad as all that.~
@60676 = ~You'll serve me if you know what's good for you, half-orc.~
@60677 = ~You go too far, <PRO_RACE>. We could have accomplished great things together, you and I. You chose to side with the rabble against me. It will be your final mistake.~
@60678 = ~You try to tell me my own mind now? I've tolerated your idiosyncrasies thus far, but my patience is at an end—as is our association. Stand aside.~
@60679 = ~As burdens go, your disappointment is one I'm willing to carry. As to your question: There is benefit in doing "good," without question. It benefits the sorry rabble that exploit your precious morality. No more. Now stand aside. I can walk past you or over you. The choice is yours.~
@60680 = ~There are few who would speak to me thus. Fewer still who'd survive doing so. Stand aside, <CHARNAME>. Stand aside while you're still able to stand at all.~
@60681 = ~Wilhelmina~
@60682 = ~I'll be better once this night's business is done.~
@60683 = ~I am the slayer of Sarevok, the hero of Baldur's Gate! Are you so arrogant as to think you have anything of value to offer me? Begone!~
@60684 = ~Sarevok's minions will face justice. You have my word on it.~
@60685 = ~If I were you, I'd run like all Hells' fiends were nipping at my heels. Then again, if I were you, I doubt I'd get far. If you're not feeling lucky—I wouldn't be—go and surrender to the Flaming Fist at the crypt entrance.~
@60686 = ~Pray to whatever god you worship the Council of Four is more merciful than your master, Sarevok.~
@60687 = ~Forgive me this trespass, I beg you. Criminals have taken up residence in this place—I want only to see them gone from it.~
@60688 = ~Forgive me this trespass, I beg you. Criminals had taken up residence in this place—I came to drive them from it, and I believe I've been successful. ~
@60689 = ~You've made the wise decision. The Flaming Fist waits outside. Go to them now.~
@60690 = ~I truly hope so—Baldur's Gate needs it to be, to begin healing the wounds my half-brother inflicted upon it.~
@60691 = ~I'm good, but I'm not THAT good. When I've dealt with Korlasz, I'll let you know.~
@60692 = ~Got it.~
@60693 = ~I can't in good conscience leave the girl behind.~
@60694 = ~As you wish. When you find her, we'll go.~
@60695 = ~Did you find the girl yet?~
@60696 = ~Not yet. I fear something terrible has happened to her.~
@60697 = ~I'm not convinced there's a girl to find. Now that I've had some time to think about it, it seems likely she was actually that doppelganger I slew.~
@60698 = ~Forget the girl. I am done with this infernal crypt.~
@60699 = ~Then we can go?~
@60700 = ~Yes. Let us be away from this dismal place.~
@60701 = ~Soon. I'd like to explore the crypt a little more.~
@60702 = ~We go when I say we can, not one second sooner.~
@60703 = ~When you're ready to go, you know where to find me.~
@60704 = ~Is it possible she wasn't a girl? Sarevok did use an awful lot of doppelgangers.~
@60705 = ~Of course—I slew one disguised as you just outside the entrance chamber. All is explained.~
@60706 = ~Oh, bloody hells. I've just wasted I don't want to know how long looking for a dead doppelganger. I hate to say it, Imoen, but the hero of Baldur's Gate, <PRO_HESHE>'s not very smart.~
@60707 = ~Hm... There may be something in what you say.~
@60708 = ~You were worried about a child's safety. I think that's sweet.~
@60709 = ~You don't need to tell me twice.~
@60710 = ~That is for the gods to decide.~
@60711 = ~Good. I need to talk about what's going on.~ [BD60711]
@60712 = ~We've been through much of late—but we've prevailed. We can't fall victim to fear now.~
@60713 = ~You're right. I know you're right. I just— Oh, I don't know. Hells. I just feel silly.~ [BD60713]
@60714 = ~Of course. We'll leave you to your work. Excuse us.~
@60715 = ~Isn't it a little late to be cleaning a bedchamber? Or really, really early?~
@60716 = ~Caelar Argent. The town's abuzz with tales of her activities. "The Shining Lady," some call her.~
@60717 = ~She calls it a crusade? What god do she and her people fight for?~
@60718 = ~Mystra to Cyric and everyone in between, depending who you ask. There's plenty of hearsay going around, not so much in the way of actual facts. Come, the dukes are waiting.~
@60719 = ~The nerve of the woman, attacking the hero of Baldur's Gate in the Ducal Palace. This cannot go unanswered.~
@60720 = ~Let's.~
@60721 = ~I must take my leave of you now. I've a long journey ahead.~
@60722 = ~What about the coin I earned in former adventures? I'd like to reclaim it and spend it.~
@60723 = ~The ducal purser, Ophyllis, has been holding your money for you. He should be in the basement, near the vault if not actually inside it. I'll be here once you've got your gold. Be quick about it, though.~
@60724 = ~That's all you could find?~
@60725 = ~The city's awash in refugees, and the Fist is short-handed. We found who we could in the time we had. Come on, then, let's be about our business.~
@60726 = ~That's great news if it'll get you to leave here sooner.~
@60727 = ~Get out of my room, you wretched child!~
@60728 = ~I know, Mama. I love you too.~
@60729 = ~I'm going to miss you so much, Rohma.~
@60730 = ~I'd tell you if I knew, Rohma. Corwin, I hate to take you away, but we really should get moving.~
@60731 = ~After Sarevok's fall, I searched for you. What happened?~
@60732 = ~An aasimar, you say? Now that you mention it, I recall tales of a House Argent, and how those of its line were touched by the divine.~
@60733 = ~He claims fealty to ALL the gods? Is he mad? I know enough of gods to know none would allow their followers such freedom.~
@60734 = ~The Council of Four asked me to join this expedition. I'll not turn my back on Baldur's Gate in its hour of need.~
@60735 = ~Join the troops if you wish, but not I. Follow the campfires and tell the guard I sent you.~
@60736 = ~Tell me what you know of the Shining Lady, Edwin.~
@60737 = ~The best thing we can do for the city is press on. Once Caelar is dealt with, we can focus on other matters.~
@60738 = ~You're right about that, but I fear there's little we can do about it.~
@60739 = ~All the city's problems have Caelar at their source. Let us make our way to Dragonspear.~
@60740 = ~The best thing we can do—the only thing we can do, really—is bring Caelar's crusade to an end.~
@60741 = ~There's little YOU can do about it. The city means nothing to me.~
@60742 = ~You are too callous, my friend. I have seen the suffering in the city firsthand. People's lives should not be so casually dismissed.~ [BD60742]
@60743 = ~I've got a few ideas myself. But I agree, we should talk to Corporal Duncan. Perhaps we could speak about Caelar first?~
@60744 = ~Trade may not matter to you, <CHARNAME>, but not all enjoy so lofty a perch as yours.~ [BD60744]
@60745 = ~Evil has taken root in the Castle of the Dragonspear. The sooner we get there, the sooner we can pull it up by the stump!~ [BD60745]
@60746 = ~What route remains to us?~
@60747 = ~A title given to me by those who I have inspired, those who believe in my cause. I will not be shamed for acting as a beacon of light to those in darkness.~ [BD60747]
@60748 = ~A goal we are slightly nearer achieving with your arrival—but only slightly. The crusade's forces vastly outnumber us.~
@60749 = ~All I can hear is you yelling at yourself.~
@60750 = ~I'll leave you to the sound of your own grating voice.~
@60751 = ~Patience, Neera. Good things come to those who wait. Here's your feather.~
@60752 = ~I don't know how much longer I CAN wait. I'm losing my mind here. Actually, it's worse than losing my mind—I've gained a second mind.~
@60753 = ~Quite correct!~
@60754 = ~Ah, that's a wonderful sentiment, Pritchard. I mean—I'm a cleric, so I won't be able to actually wield it in the strictest sense of the word, but I'll carry it. As a Gardnersonson, proudly, I'll carry it.~ [BD60754]
@60755 = ~You don't like it.~
@60756 = ~No, no, no, no, I do like it. I love it! I'll treasure it always.~ [BD60756]
@60757 = ~You just won't ever use it. Fine, that's all right. You're a cleric. I understand. I get it. ~
@60758 = ~I'll be going now. Luck to you in, you know. All of this. Farewell. ~
@60759 = ~You talk and you talk and you never listen!~
@60760 = ~I'm going to listen to your skull crack like an egg if you don't let this go!~
@60761 = ~The crusade is weak! The militia can take them alone if we act quickly and with resolve!~
@60762 = ~I'll hear no more of this, Pritchard. My hands are tied here.~
@60763 = ~Defeating the crusade would be so easy if you'd just follow the 78 points of the plan I've drawn up.~
@60764 = ~Forgive my interruption, but I must speak with Master Gardnersonson.~
@60765 = ~Egotistical bloody gnomes—! If defeating Caelar were easy, we'd have done it by now, don't you think?~
@60766 = ~Forget it, friend. You really think anyone's going to listen to people like us?~
@60767 = ~Can the plan wait? Quartermaster Belegarm sent me to fetch you. He's a gnomish item he believes you'll find very interesting.~
@60768 = ~"Bloody gnomes"? Have a care, <CHARNAME>. I'm standing right here...~
@60769 = ~What I think is, Caelar would have been defeated by now if the commanders were to follow my plan.~
@60770 = ~We've been discussing important strategic matters. What do you want?~ [BD60770]
@60771 = ~Nothing that cannot wait for another time, I think. Forgive me the intrusion.~
@60772 = ~Quartermaster Belegarm wanted me to find you. He's got a gnomish item he thinks you'll find very interesting.~
@60773 = ~I thought you should know I heard a couple of your fellow militiamen, Sempek and Damius, plot against you.~
@60774 = ~I want nothing from you, little man.~
@60775 = ~Oh did he now? Intriguing. General Stonehand, if you'd excuse me?~
@60776 = ~Gladly. Take as much time as you need. Take MORE than that, even. The whole <DAYNIGHTALL>, if you have to. I could use some peace.~
@60777 = ~Cloakshadow's cloak's shadow, <CHARNAME>! There's nothing to be gained from insulting the man. Forgive my friend, cousin. He was raised in Candlekeep. Monks, you know?~ [BD60777]
@60778 = ~If you've nothing to contribute, begone. I've no time to waste on frivolous conversation.~
@60779 = ~Oh look, Sempek. It's our "friend."~
@60780 = ~Hey, <CHARNAME>—on behalf of the children I'm never going to have after the kicking Stonehand gave us, thanks for ratting us out.~
@60781 = ~You plotted against a superior officer. I had little choice but to do as I did.~
@60782 = ~Sorry about that. I was talking to Stonehand and I meant to ask where the mess tent was, but I slipped.~
@60783 = ~After all that, a wiser man might have learned to keep his mouth shut, but not you, it seems. Perhaps another lesson is in order.~
@60784 = ~Let me teach them, <CHARNAME>. They'll quickly learn the folly of their ways and I promise you, they'll never repeat them.~
@60785 = ~No, please. We get it. We know what to do. What not to do. On our honor, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, we'll say no more, about anything, to anyone, ever.~
@60786 = ~I don't know how things work in Daggerford's militia, but you're part of a greater military force now. If you've a problem with your commanding officer, handle it through proper channels.~
@60787 = ~Aye, right. What else is there to do? Put up and shut up. It's the good soldier's lot, isn't it? Begone. I don't want to see your smug face no more.~
@60788 = ~Yeah. Funny. Well, we got it now. Say nothing and trust no one. Lesson learnt.~
@60789 = ~Not sayin' nothin' to no one.~
@60790 = ~Got nothing to say to you. You or anyone.~
@60791 = ~Can't talk—the crusade's on the move!~
@60792 = ~The north part of the camp's on fire!~
@60793 = ~Grab a sword, find a crusader, and start swinging!~
@60794 = ~We're under attack! Make yourself useful!~
@60795 = ~Don't just stand there gawping. If you've nothing else to do, go find Andrus by the fire near the command tent.~
@60796 = ~Out of my way!~
@60797 = ~The crusade attacks! Make yourself useful, "hero"!~
@60798 = ~Sorry, I can't talk. I gotta get these potions to my lieutenant.~
@60799 = ~The crusade's wiped out half of Daggerford's troops—we need to turn this around!~
@60800 = ~Have you seen General Stonehand? I need to find General Stonehand.~
@60801 = ~GENERAL STONEHAND, WHERE ARE YOU?~
@60802 = ~Death to Caelar! Waterdeep forever!~
@60803 = ~Philo, down by the command tent, just healed me. I've got to get back to my squad.~
@60804 = ~The crusaders want to go to the Hells? I'll send them there myself.~
@60805 = ~If you've nothing else to do, find a mage named Andrus near the fire down past the command tent—she says she needs help.~
@60806 = ~Is it true? The camp's under attack? Gods damn it, I need to find my unit!~
@60807 = ~Healing... I need heal—uhhh...~
@60808 = ~If the crusade reaches Andrus and those damned barrels, we're done for. Damn that crazed dwarf Dugdeep, she's killed us all!~
@60809 = ~They killed my commander, all my unit, dead. They've got to pay. DEATH TO THE CRUSADE!~
@60810 = ~For the Flaming Fist! For Baldur's Gate! For the Sword Coast! Death to the Shining Lady!~
@60811 = ~Where's the crusade? Where are they? My sword's got a mighty thirst!~
@60812 = ~That's not everything I've got, but that's all you're getting—you're not the only fighters I've got to supply.~
@60813 = ~Now go show the Shining Lady the Sword Coast's mettle!~
@60814 = ~I hear fighting in the north!~
@60815 = ~Lead on, I shall follow.~
@60816 = ~For Baldur's Gate! For the Sword Coast! Victory or death!~
@60817 = ~Yes! What is it now?~
@60818 = ~Belegarm. Do you know what's happening here?~
@60819 = ~I am in need of healing.~
@60820 = ~Do you have any potions left?~
@60821 = ~What's available in the way of armor?~
@60822 = ~Weapons. I could use some.~
@60823 = ~If you've got any magic items or scrolls to spare, I could probably find a use for them.~
@60824 = ~I need an edge in the coming battle. Have you any special items I could take?~
@60825 = ~Nothing. I'll leave you to your duties.~
@60826 = ~Oh, I know what's happening. Caelar's decided to end the siege, one way or the other. The crusade got a dragon to set fire to the camp. While all eyes were on Dragonspear, undead fire giants hit us from the south. You killed Caelar and her followers attacked the camp, bent on vengeance.~
@60827 = ~I've heard as many stories about what's happening as I've had soldiers come by, and I've had a LOT of soldiers come by this past hour. Now what can I do for you?~
@60828 = ~I need healing.~
@60829 = ~What potions do you have available?~
@60830 = ~What've you got in the way of weapons?~
@60831 = ~You could give me some armor that isn't about to fall off my shoulders.~
@60832 = ~I could use some magical support.~
@60833 = ~You tell me. Have you anything in the way of unusual items I might be able to use against our enemies?~
@60834 = ~You seem busy enough. I'll leave you to your duties. Farewell.~
@60835 = ~Let's see what I've got.~
@60836 = ~Anything else?~
@60837 = ~I need healing.~
@60838 = ~What potions do you have available?~
@60839 = ~What've you got in the way of weapons?~
@60840 = ~You could give me some armor that isn't about to fall off my shoulders.~
@60841 = ~I could use some magical support.~
@60842 = ~You tell me. Have you anything in the way of unusual items I might be able to use against our enemies?~
@60843 = ~That will do. Farewell, Belegarm.~
@60844 = ~I haven't seen Mizhena lately... I might have some healing potions left—don't know, I'll have to check.~
@60845 = ~I'll try that, then. Thanks.~
@60846 = ~Let's see what potions you've got.~
@60847 = ~What have you got for a weapons selection?~
@60848 = ~I need some armor, preferably some that isn't about to fall off my shoulders.~
@60849 = ~Never mind that, then. What have you got left in the way of magic?~
@60850 = ~Have you anything in the way of unusual items I might be able to use against our enemies?~
@60851 = ~You're of no use to me, then. Help this rabble, I'll take care of myself.~
@60852 = ~Be careful out there. Luck to you.~
@60853 = ~Daeros~
@60854 = ~I will find a way around you, dragon. Mark my words.~
@60855 = ~You seem committed to barring entry. Why do you protect this door so viciously?~
@60856 = ~I have studied the ways of spirits. I can tell you are not here by your own will. Someone controls you, don't they?~
@60857 = ~Then there is nothing more for me to say either.~
@60858 = ~You will be the one to die, dragon!~
@60859 = ~Will the spirit make good on her threats, M'Khiin? If we try to pass, will she attack us?~
@60860 = ~I will find a way around you, dragon. Mark my words.~
@60861 = ~I cannot make bargains, not while another compels me.~
@60862 = ~I hear the plea beneath your words, dragon. I will find whoever has bound you to their will and set you free.~
@60863 = ~Ghost Dragon Guardian

I should pass by the dragon into the room beyond and try to find whoever controls it.

I encountered the shade of an enormous dragon outside a pair of doors. The dragon called itself Halatathlaer, and I recognized the name from a journal I found. I told Halatathlaer of the fate of its eggs, and though it was grieved, it thanked me. Halatathlaer says it cannot help me directly but that if its "essence" is freed, I can count on its aid.~
@60864 = ~Very well. I shall walk past you now. Do what you must, but know that I will do the same.~
@60865 = ~Then I must pass by you. Be warned; if you strike me, I will end your unlife.~
@60866 = ~Then I have no choice but to destroy you. Die, dragon!~
@60867 = ~I can say nothing of him while he controls my essence. He compels me to obey his every command.~
@60868 = ~In that case, I will search for your essence and wrest it from his control. Then you will be free.~
@60869 = ~He'll have a hard time issuing commands with a crushed skull.~
@60870 = ~What is this Kanaglym you mentioned?~
@60871 = ~You mentioned Kanaglym. Is this the door, then, to the forgotten dwarven city—where the fountain of Nepenthe bridges this world and the Fugue Plane?~
@60872 = ~I know the name you mentioned. Kanaglym. This is the entrance to the forgotten city of my people.~
@60873 = ~Your warnings and hints mean nothing to me. I go where I will and destroy all who stand in my way.~
@60874 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. I've come to speak to the prisoner Tiax.~
@60875 = ~My business here is done.~
@60876 = ~Waste of time, but it's your time to waste. He's through the door.~
@60877 = ~Didn't I tell you to begone? Don't answer, I know I did. Get off with you, now!~
@60878 = ~Torture? Tell me this isn't true. Are we so afraid of Caelar Argent, are our principles truly so weak that we stoop to such vile deeds?~
@60879 = ~I didn't come here to listen to others argue moral issues. What do you want of me?~
@60880 = ~It gets you an enemy broken in body and spirit. That alone makes it a worthy pursuit.~
@60881 = ~I'd stoop lower than that if it meant saving the life of a single soldier under my command.~ [BD60881]
@60882 = ~A noble sentiment for an unforgivable crime.~
@60883 = ~Does this sort of talk make anyone else uncomfortable? Because my skin is crawling right now.~
@60884 = ~A hollow excuse—and an unnecessary one. You have information regarding the crusade. Tell me what it is, and what you would have me do with it.~
@60885 = ~Judge me if you must, <CHARNAME>, but for the Sword Coast's sake, do it after the Shining Lady's been dealt with.~
@60886 = ~...Very well. What do you require of me?~
@60887 = ~Fine. Let's pretend we haven't flung ourselves from the moral high ground and be about our business, then.~
@60888 = ~I like you, de Lancie. You have... focus. Caelar Argent, then. Tell me how we shall destroy her.~
@60889 = ~Well said, <CHARNAME>. An adversary's destruction is its own reward. If it yields useful information, so much the better.~ [BD60889]
@60890 = ~And there it is, de Lancie. Finally, you have some support, and it comes from this half-orc brute. Are you happy now?~ [BD60890]
@60891 = ~We have reason to believe Caelar Argent's top advisor, a priest named Hephernaan, is quartered in Dragonspear's basement. We know very little of Hephernaan, other than he apparently has Caelar's ear.~ [BD60891]
@60892 = ~We do know that a series of caverns runs beneath the castle. We believe Caelar is channeling supplies through the tunnels rather than attempting to break our perimeter. So there is a way into the castle from below.~ [BD60892]
@60893 = ~You would have me find these caverns and enter Dragonspear to learn more of Hephernaan and Caelar's plans.~
@60894 = ~You want me to use the caverns beneath Dragonspear Castle—our enemy's stronghold—to break into the castle—again, the stronghold of our enemy—to try and gather intelligence about this Hephernaan?~
@60895 = ~Our enemy has a weakness. I'll find these underground caverns, make my way into Dragonspear, and see what there is to learn of Hephernaan and his wretched mistress.~
@60896 = ~Or just kill him. That would also be an acceptable result.~ [BD60896]
@60897 = ~I am not your assassin.~
@60898 = ~Yeah. I could definitely accept that.~
@60899 = ~If Hephernaan crosses my path, he'll not live to cross another's.~
@60900 = ~Then yes. Find his quarters and learn what you can.~ [BD60900]
@60901 = ~That is what needs doing. Will you do it?~ [BD60901]
@60902 = ~I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't... unsettled, knowing how you came by your intelligence. But the Shining Lady is the greater danger. She must be dealt with. I will do as you ask.~
@60903 = ~You had me at "go spelunking to find a way to break into our enemy's stronghold to learn more about her and her advisors."~
@60904 = ~There is little I wouldn't do to see Caelar's light snuffed out now and for all time.~
@60905 = ~Huh?~
@60906 = ~What <PRO_HESHE>'s saying is "yes," General Stonehand.~
@60907 = ~Good. Well, be about your business, then.~
@60908 = ~Ah, a moment if ye will. We've got to wait for the third participant of this little meetin'. ~
@60909 = ~And you're certain it's stable?~ [BD60909]
@60910 = ~Am I certain it's stable? Am I CERTAIN it's stable? AM I certain it's stable?~
@60911 = ~I'm certain. Pretty certain. I mean, there's stable and there's STABLE, you know?~
@60912 = ~Looks like the hero's arrived.~
@60913 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>. Glad you came. This is Phossey Dugdeep.~ [BD60913]
@60914 = ~Good to know ya.~
@60915 = ~Pleased to make your acquaintance, ma'am.~
@60916 = ~Spoken like someone who doesn't know me. Tell me, de Lancie, what could possibly be worth delaying my journey to the caverns beneath Dragonspear?~
@60917 = ~You told me to find Dugdeep and I have. Now what do you want?~
@60918 = ~The same as you, I imagine—victory over the Shining Lady, minimizing our forces' losses as we achieve it. Your arrival and impending departure for the caverns beneath Dragonspear give us some new options in that regard. Phossey, tell them about the barrel of potion of explosion.~ [BD60918]
@60919 = ~Phossey, tell them about the potion of explosion barrel.~ [BD60919]
@60920 = ~How am I to know the right spot?~
@60921 = ~Indeed it could. Give me the barrel.~
@60922 = ~Barrel of Bwoosh! Not potion of explosion. And you needn't worry. In my entire life, I've only messed up once this year. So take the barrel, keep it safe, hide it where it'll hurt the crusade worst, and when you get back... Bwoosh! All right? Good.~
@60923 = ~What? I— Sure, I s'pose. I mean, it's my tent 'n all, but—yeah. All right. I'll just... go over here then.~
@60924 = ~The explosives are just one strategy I've formulated to undermine our enemy. I've another that you might help with. These flasks contain poison taken from a priestess of Talona we captured and interrogated. Her evil works can now be turned to the greater good.~ [BD60924]
@60925 = ~We know Dragonspear is being supplied via the caverns you'll be visiting shortly, if all goes as planned. If you put a few drops of this in the enemy food supplies and water, we would have an edge when we finally confront the Shining Lady.~ [BD60925]
@60926 = ~Poison an enemy army? You sicken me, de Lancie. Is this the honor of the Waterdhavian guard?~
@60927 = ~That would give us a significant advantage, but managing it would entail significant risk. Which means I'll want a significant reward.~
@60928 = ~I will show the Shining Lady's followers the same mercy they would have shown me. Give me the poison.~
@60929 = ~What? Explosives are one thing, but poison is too much. I'll hear no more of this.~
@60930 = ~Given a choice between victory and honor, I know which I'll choose. I can see you'll not be persuaded entirely by reason—given your reputation, I can't say I'm surprised. Perhaps you are open to compromise. Would it change your mind if I told you the poison wasn't lethal?~
@60931 = ~A victory stolen is no victory worth having. Were you anyone else I'd cut you down for even proposing such villainy.~
@60932 = ~Incapacitating an enemy without killing them is an ideal situation.~
@60933 = ~I still don't like it, but I've done a lot of things I don't like in this life. I'll be able to live with this one.~
@60934 = ~A lesser sin is a sin still. Do not speak to me of this again.~
@60935 = ~Hah! I like you, <CHARNAME>. Very well. Here is the poison. One drop in a barrel of water or three in a crate of potatoes. That's all it'll take.~ [BD60935]
@60936 = ~Damn it! Your reticence this day is going to kill people. Good men and women. I will do everything in my power to see an end to Caelar Argent. You, it seems, will not. The blood of those who fall to the crusade is on your hands.~ [BD60936]
@60937 = ~Begone. The sight of you disgusts me, I'll look upon you no more.~ [BD60937]
@60938 = ~You are doing the Sword Coast a great service, <CHARNAME>. May fortune smile upon you in your mission. Farewell.~ [BD60938]
@60939 = ~Eh. I'd rather a sword in the chest or even a knife in the back, but I'll not argue this.~ [BD60939]
@60940 = ~Do this and you'll be more than adequately rewarded, I assure you.~ [BD60940]
@60941 = ~Well said, my friend. If we sink to such depths, how are we any better than our enemy?~ [BD60941]
@60942 = ~Why couldn't you leave well enough alone? I didn't want this—you drove me to it!~
@60943 = ~Wherever we're going, let's get there fast. There's a fine line between a crowd and a mob, and I'd rather not be outside when it gets crossed. ~
@60944 = ~Where ARE we going? ~
@60945 = ~You have no sense of adventure. ~
@60946 = ~Show some backbone. You're a captain of the Flaming Fist. ~
@60947 = ~And I want to live long enough to become a colonel. Are we doing this or not? ~
@60948 = ~Where should we go? ~
@60949 = ~We are. Follow me. ~
@60950 = ~In truth, I'm not sure it's worth the effort. ~
@60951 = ~I had a sense of adventure once. Then I had some adventures. Now I just have sense. Where are we going? ~
@60952 = ~What do we have for options? ~
@60953 = ~Follow me. ~
@60954 = ~I haven't decided yet. ~
@60955 = ~You tell me. There's a couple of Rashemi adventurers we can talk to at the Three Old Kegs, that bard or the thieves at the Elfsong Tavern, or a monk at the Iron Throne building. Or we could just return to the palace.~
@60956 = ~All right, I know what I want to do. Follow me. ~
@60957 = ~You tell me. We are to acquire equipment and allies for the trip north. There's a couple of Rashemi adventurers we can talk to at the Three Old Kegs, that bard or the thieves at the Elfsong Tavern, or a monk at the Iron Throne building. Or we could just return to the palace.~
@60958 = ~Tell me about these thieves. ~
@60959 = ~A bard, you say? ~
@60960 = ~You forgot the cleric being held in the Flaming Fist headquarters. ~
@60961 = ~What can you tell me about the Rashemi pair? ~
@60962 = ~I feel safer out here than in there. ~
@60963 = ~I hadn't, actually—I just hoped you had. You really want to see that loon? ~
@60964 = ~I don't want to rule anything out. But we're getting nothing accomplished lingering here. Follow me. ~
@60965 = ~Perhaps. Tell me about this monk at the Iron Throne building.~
@60966 = ~Maybe. What do you know about the thieves at the Elfsong Tavern? ~
@60967 = ~Duke Eltan seems to think I should. He also suggested I contact a bard of some sort, didn't he? ~
@60968 = ~I'm considering it. Tell me about this pair of Rashemi adventurers. ~
@60969 = ~I can't fault you for that, given what's happened. But wherever we're going to go, let's go. ~
@60970 = ~You can count on that. Let's go. ~
@60971 = ~Well, do me a favor and make up your mind sooner than later. The crusade's wasting no time. We can't afford to, either. ~
@60972 = ~~
@60973 = ~All right, I've made my decision. Stay by me. ~
@60974 = ~And the thieves? ~
@60975 = ~Who are these adventurers from Rashemen you mentioned? ~
@60976 = ~I seem to recall someone mentioning a cleric at the Flaming Fist headquarters... Did you forget him?~
@60977 = ~And the bard Eltan suggested I contact? What do they say of him?~
@60978 = ~Coran and Safana. Not sure they're the sort of people we need in this venture, but Duke Eltan believed you might want them to join us. ~
@60979 = ~Well, we'll not learn anything useful standing here talking. Stick close to me. ~
@60980 = ~Perhaps. What about these adventurers from Rashemen? ~
@60981 = ~I understand he thought the same of a cleric in the Flaming Fist headquarters. Don't tell me you forgot about him. ~
@60982 = ~What do you think about the bard he suggested I contact? ~
@60983 = ~A good thief can be a handy thing to have. What do you think of the monk, the one at the Iron Throne building? ~
@60984 = ~Thievery—a despicable practice. Let us speak no more of it. Tell me about the monk. ~
@60985 = ~A wychlaran named Dynaheir and her bodyguard, Minsc. She might be useful, but I have my doubts about him. Word is he's taken a few too many blows to the head and it's made him... let's call it unpredictable. ~
@60986 = ~All right, let's be about our business. You'll watch my back? ~
@60987 = ~You mentioned a bard, I believe? ~
@60988 = ~Did you forget about the cleric at the Flaming Fist headquarters? ~
@60989 = ~I assume this monk at the Iron Throne building is less erratic? ~
@60990 = ~What can you tell me of the thieves at the Elfsong Tavern?~
@60991 = ~Garrick. He's become a regular at the Elfsong Tavern, which doesn't tell me much about his talent but does make me question his intelligence. It's not a venue that welcomes most singers.~
@60992 = ~That's the tavern which only allows the ghost to sing, yes? Well, that's Garrick's concern, not mine. Let's be about our business. Stay close to me and watch my back. ~
@60993 = ~That is odd. But we've other matters to attend to. Follow me. ~
@60994 = ~The Iron Throne wasn't always welcoming to friendly monks, yet there's one there now, is there not? ~
@60995 = ~Tell me about the Rashemi adventurers staying at the Three Old Kegs. ~
@60996 = ~You mentioned some thieves...? ~
@60997 = ~Are you trying to avoid the cleric at the Flaming Fist headquarters, or did you just forget about him? ~
@60998 = ~What have we here?~ [BD60998]
@60999 = ~Captain Schael Corwin, allow me to introduce Dynaheir and Minsc of Rashemen. ~
@61000 = ~This is Minsc of Rashemen. ~
@61001 = ~Captain Schael Corwin of the Flaming Fist, allow me to introduce Dynaheir, wychlaran of Rashemen. Take a few minutes, get acquainted. ~
@61002 = ~You know exactly what we have here—you brought me here to get them. ~
@61003 = ~You can meet them on your own time. I've more important things to do. ~
@61004 = ~And this is Boo. Say hello, Boo.~ [BD61004]
@61005 = ~It's a long way to Dragonspear, <CHARNAME>. Are you sure you want to bring the hamster along? ~
@61006 = ~I am sure Minsc will prove invaluable, as will Boo. ~
@61007 = ~The hamster and the ranger are a package deal, I'm afraid. ~
@61008 = ~You question me, Captain Corwin? Don't. ~
@61009 = ~All right, if that's the way you want it. I'll follow you out when you leave.~
@61010 = ~I am. ~
@61011 = ~Not just yet. ~
@61012 = ~If I were, we wouldn't be standing here talking. ~
@61013 = ~Surely we should depart immediately? Who knows what mischief Caelar might get up to while we dither? ~
@61014 = ~The wychlaran has her priorities straight—I like that. <CHARNAME>, are you sure you don't want to go yet? ~
@61015 = ~Very well. Let us leave this place. ~
@61016 = ~Don't push me, Captain. When I'm depart, I will let you know. ~
@61017 = ~Let's go. ~
@61018 = ~Nice to meet you. I'll follow you out when you leave.~
@61019 = ~Well met, <CHARNAME>. And even more well met, my lady...? ~
@61020 = ~This is Safana. Safana, this is Captain Schael Corwin of the Flaming Fist. ~
@61021 = ~Captain Schael Corwin of the Flaming Fist, meet Safana of no particular allegiance. ~
@61022 = ~Captain Schael Corwin, Safana. I believe our business here is concluded, Corwin. ~
@61023 = ~Good to meet you, Safana. I look forward to working together. ~
@61024 = ~Do you now? We'll see how long that lasts.~ [BD61024]
@61025 = ~Are you ready to move on, <CHARNAME>? ~
@61026 = ~I am. ~
@61027 = ~No, not yet. I would spend a little more time in the Elfsong yet. ~
@61028 = ~I'd not be standing here otherwise. ~
@61029 = ~Then let's go. Stay close to me, Safana. The streets aren't safe for anyone, especially not a woman of your beauty. ~
@61030 = ~All riiight...~ [BD61030]
@61031 = ~Canst thou think of nothing better to do this night than lounge around some tavern?~ [BD61031]
@61032 = ~If you insist. I'll await you here. ~
@61033 = ~Apparently, <PRO_HESHE> can't. When you do, <CHARNAME>, let me know. I'm not going anywhere, apparently. ~
@61034 = ~Out after curfew, boys. Not a smart thing for noble fellows like your esteemed selves to be doing. ~
@61035 = ~There's a curfew? With all the rabble filling the streets, you could've fooled me.~
@61036 = ~There's a curfew? With all the rabble filling the streets, you could've fooled me.~
@61037 = ~Please just leave us alone. We're not doing any harm.~
@61038 = ~Nothing to see here. Be on your way. ~
@61039 = ~What're you lookin' at? ~
@61040 = ~What's going on here? ~
@61041 = ~From the sound of things, I'm looking at a gang of thugs engaged in a serious crime. ~
@61042 = ~Nothing of any interest. ~
@61043 = ~You there! Yes, you! I'll give you a purse of gold for each one of these Flaming Fist thugs you run off! ~
@61044 = ~What's going on here? ~
@61045 = ~These men and women protect this city and your fathers, boy. Show some respect. ~
@61046 = ~I'll just take the gold, I don't really need a purse. ~
@61047 = ~You'll need to give me more than that to cross the city's protectors. ~
@61048 = ~Two purses, then! ~
@61049 = ~Agreed. Be on your way, mercenaries. ~
@61050 = ~Enjoy your beating, boys. ~
@61051 = ~Help us! Help us, please! We weren't doing anything and these mercenaries attacked us! ~
@61052 = ~Is that true, officer? ~
@61053 = ~Calm yourself, lad. Tell me what's happening here. ~
@61054 = ~I fail to see how that's any concern of mine. ~
@61055 = ~The Flaming Fist has this matter in hand. Be on your way. ~
@61056 = ~Awright, then. Sounds like it's time for us to register our displeasure with the lords 'n ladies o' the city—via some smug, prinkin' noblespawn faces! ~
@61057 = ~That's no business of yours. ~
@61058 = ~You aren't going to let them beat these kids, are you, <CHARNAME>? ~
@61059 = ~Of course not. Begone, you sadistic lackwits! You've had your fun, now it's over. ~
@61060 = ~That's precisely what I intend to do. ~
@61061 = ~If I had more time to spare, I'd help them beat the spoilt brats. ~
@61062 = ~We were just out having a little fun, not really doing anything, just taking in the sights, you know, and we weren't doing anything wrong other than being out after curfew, you know, but then these thugs came along, and you've got to help us; please, please, please, you're the hero of Baldur's Gate; please, you've got to help us.~
@61063 = ~Steady on, Rolff. This lot is nothing to be afraid of. They're mercenary scum. Our fathers eat people like this for breakfast. ~
@61064 = ~The Flaming Fist protects this city and your fathers, boy. Show some respect. And you, mercenaries. You do yourself a disservice, harassing children thus. Be on your way.~
@61065 = ~Enjoy your beating, boys. ~
@61066 = ~Unfortunately for you, your fathers aren't here right now. They're all yours, mercenary. ~
@61067 = ~Yeah—yeah, awright. C'mon, lads. Let's go find us some beggars to punch. Nobody cares what happens to them.~
@61068 = ~Me mum, me commanding officer, and Lathander. Those are who I answer to, in order. Ye're not any o' them. Which is unfortunate fer you, 'cuz if you were, you wouldn't be about to get the thrashing of yer bloody life. Get <PRO_HIMHER>, boys!~
@61069 = ~Thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. We are in your debt. ~
@61070 = ~It was nothing. In future, take care where you wander and what you wear when doing so. Hard times can drive even the noblest soul to evil.~
@61071 = ~That's true. I believe your friend mentioned something about some gold in exchange for saving you? ~
@61072 = ~So you are. Hand over all your money and we'll call it even. ~
@61073 = ~Not for long. Give me everything you've got. ~
@61074 = ~What? You can't do this! ~
@61075 = ~You're right. I can't. But I hope you've learned a lesson here this <DAYNIGHTALL>. ~
@61076 = ~I'd suggest you call the Flaming Fist, but you seem to have gotten on their bad side somehow. Now, your gold, please.~
@61077 = ~I rather think I can. ~
@61078 = ~Fine. But my father will hear of this, you can be sure of that. Come on, Rolff. Let's get out of here. ~
@61079 = ~Here, please, take this gem as a token of our appreciation for your help. ~
@61080 = ~What help? We had those louts right where we wanted them! ~
@61081 = ~Shut up, Kieran. Just shut up. ~
@61082 = ~Rolff~
@61083 = ~Kieran~
@61084 = ~Of course, Torsin de Lancie. I will leave immediately.~
@61085 = ~Good. Off with you, then.~
@61086 = ~I've heard of the Order of the Aster. They are holy warriors in service to Lathander. You say Caelar belongs to this group?~
@61087 = ~I seek a young woman I'm told recently wandered out of the camp. She'd be wearing Flaming Fist livery, but carried herself with a noble's poise.~
@61088 = ~We are each called to serve in our own way. If you've a problem with your assignment, take it up with your commanding officer.~
@61089 = ~I seek a young woman I'm told recently wandered out of the camp. She'd be wearing Flaming Fist livery, but carried herself with a noble's poise.~
@61090 = ~What do you want, "hero"?~
@61091 = ~I seek a young woman I'm told recently wandered out of the camp. She'd be wearing Flaming Fist livery, but carried herself with a noble's poise.~
@61092 = ~I want nothing from you. Give me any more lip and I may take some teeth, though.~
@61093 = ~I'll not spend a month in chains on your account. Come find me in Daggerford when this is all over and we'll have us a little talk, you and I. Now be on your way.~
@61094 = ~Enough! We've better things to do than aggravate our own people. Come on, let's go.~
@61095 = ~Stupid. Nothin' good comes from people knowing you.~ [BD61095]
@61096 = ~Turn the wheel, you primitive brute. Raise me up into Dragonspear.~
@61097 = ~What do you want?~
@61098 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate. I come to punish Caelar for her crimes.~
@61099 = ~You fools! What have you done? The Bhaalspawn's no use to us dead!~ [BD61099]
@61100 = ~A fire burnt out cannot be restored, nor can a dead child of Bhaal be revived. Ashes are all that is left of either.~
@61101 = ~Glint Gardnersonson~
@61102 = ~And if I like being the featured character in these tales of wonder and adventure?~
@61103 = ~That's the most sensible thing I've heard in a tenday. Something has clearly gone very, very wrong in my life.~
@61104 = ~Adamantine equipment crumbles to dust in the sunlight.~ [WAL_07D]

@61109 = ~Is everything all right here? ~
@61110 = ~I'm reasonably sure I'm looking at someone I don't like. What's going on here? ~
@61111 = ~Someone whose attitude will cost him dearly if it doesn't improve soon. Very soon. You seemed upset with this gentleman here. Why? ~

@61115 = ~Is this mercenary bothering you? ~

@61117 = ~It's nothing you need to worry about. Isn't that right, Byzon?~ [BD61117]
@61118 = ~Officer Riggs was just, uh, helping me. My, er, my cat got lost, and he's helping me find it.~ [BD61118]
@61119 = ~That's right. I'm helping him find his kitty. I'll see you soon as you've got something—I mean as soon as I've got your cat, Byzon. It'll be real soon.~ [BD61119]
@61120 = ~Sure, no problem. I'll leave. But I'll be back, Byzon. I'll be back real soon.~ [BD61120]
@61121 = ~Have a, uh, have a good day, Officer Riggs.~ [BD61121]

@61123 = ~Are you all right, sir? ~
@61124 = ~Done what, exactly? Does this involve that Fist soldier that was bothering you? ~
@61125 = ~I'll leave you to continue doing it, whatever it is.~
@61126 = ~What? Oh, I—I'm fine. I'm fine.~
@61127 = ~You seem... distraught. Would this have anything to do with that Flaming Fist mercenary who was bothering you? ~
@61128 = ~Forgive me for saying so, but you don't SEEM fine. ~
@61129 = ~If you insist. Enjoy the rest of your <DAYNIGHTALL>. ~

@61131 = ~*sigh* I'm not fooling anyone. I'm NOT all right. That—that—that Flaming Fist THUG Riggs has taken everything I've got—and it's not enough. If I can't find more gold, he'll beat me worse than he did poor Yossten... I'm doomed. DOOMED!~ [BD61131]
@61132 = ~What? This perfidy will not stand. Your persecutor's name is Riggs, is it? We will have words, he and I.~
@61133 = ~Calm yourself, friend. I'll take care of this—I have some sway with the Council of Four.~
@61134 = ~We are all doomed, in the end. Farewell. ~
@61135 = ~Yes, yes. I—yes. Good. Farewell.~
@61136 = ~Truly? Oh, thank you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, thank you and bless you. If you can rid me of that plague Riggs, you'll be doing all who seek refuge in Baldur's Gate a service.~ [BD61136]
@61137 = ~I'll return when I've finished with him. ~
@61138 = ~I am the hero of Baldur's Gate. Dealing with people like Riggs is what heroes of Baldur's Gate do, right? I think so. ~

@61142 = ~Clearly, there is something going on here. Unburden thyself, Byzon. Tell us what troubles thee.~ [BD61142]
@61143 = ~He seems to be crying. Boo says this is not a sign of all right. No, no, no... There is definitely something wrong here—of this I am certain.~ [BD61143]
@61144 = ~What is it you want now?~ [BD61144]
@61145 = ~You've been stealing from the people you were assigned to protect. There will be a reckoning for that. ~
@61146 = ~Let's talk about corrupt Flaming Fist officers assigned to look after these refugees.~
@61147 = ~I've heard that a Flaming Fist officer lines his pockets with the refugees' gold. You know anything about that?~
@61148 = ~There is nothing you can do for me, scum. ~
@61149 = ~Boo says something here stinks of evil. We will find it, and then, oh, there will be a reckoning for its backside, I tell you this!~ [BD61149]
@61150 = ~A clever man like you, Officer. Surely you've seen something—or perhaps you're the clever one who's been wetting his beak in these peoples' misery?~ [BD61150]

@61152 = ~If you're smart, you're the one who'll start showing respect. The hero of Baldur's Gate is talking to you. And I'll be doing more than talk if you don't keep a civil tongue. ~
@61153 = ~Ah, sorry, Captain. It's just—well, you know how it is out here. ~
@61154 = ~We've been working our fingers to the bone keeping this scum safe. So what if I'm taking a little bonus? I earned it.~ [BD61154]
@61155 = ~You sicken me, Riggs. Give me what you took and I'll let you go. Don't, and we'll have a problem, you and I.~
@61156 = ~A higher power sees you and all your sins. Change your ways. Return what you have stolen. Kneel before those you have wronged. Humble yourself in the gods' eyes, or pay the price!~
@61157 = ~You've got a good thing going here, Riggs. The problem is, it's not YOUR good thing. ~
@61158 = ~I admire your drive, friend. I really do. It's inspired me to do something similar. Give me your purse. ~
@61159 = ~By that logic, I will have earned what I take from you. What would you rather be: a dead fool, or a breathing wise man?~
@61160 = ~The Fist needs every able-bodied person it can get to stay on top of things in the city. Even if I were taking a little bonus, Duke Eltan can't afford to dismiss a loyal fighter with fifteen years' service.~ [BD61160]
@61161 = ~Miscreants like you are no benefit to the Flaming Fist. Return what you have stolen, or pay the price. ~
@61162 = ~You're probably right about that. Unfortunately for you, Duke Eltan isn't here. ~
@61163 = ~But he can afford to dismiss a chicken. ~
@61164 = ~Having met Duke Eltan, I can assure you he will have no problem in dismissing a corpse. Are the fruits of your crime worth dying for?~
@61165 = ~What the hells does that mean? ~
@61166 = ~It means you have a choice. Return what you have stolen, or pay the price. ~
@61167 = ~Give me what you stole from these people and you'll never have to find out. ~
@61168 = ~Hells is exactly what it means for you, sinner! Repent, lest you spend life everlasting in unimaginable torment! How much is your life worth?~
@61169 = ~It means the Five Fingers owns this territory now. Hand over the purse and do your job like a good little thug, all right?~
@61170 = ~It means return what you've stolen or spend the rest of your life as a chicken. Given how hungry these people are, I don't think that life would be very long. ~
@61171 = ~There are some questions you don't really want answered, Officer Riggs.~
@61172 = ~You can't do this to me! I serve the Flaming Fist!~ [BD61178]
@61173 = ~And the Flaming Fist serves the people. Return what you've stolen and I may not speak to your commanding officer about this breach of the public trust. ~
@61174 = ~Oh hells... Here, here's everything I got from them. Take it. Please. Just—don't do nothing to me. I got two girls to take care of, and a wife. And my kids too.~
@61175 = ~And you have to care for the refugees as well. Do not fail them a second time.~
@61176 = ~Take care of them, Riggs. And yourself—I don't want to have to do this again, understand?~
@61177 = ~Enjoy the rest of your <DAYNIGHTALL>, officer. ~
@61178 = ~You can't do this to me! I serve the Flaming Fist!~ [BD61178]
@61179 = ~You dare make that claim after what you've done? You serve nothing but your own avarice. And I'll not stand for it. ~
@61180 = ~Wise up, Riggs. You know how things are in Baldur's Gate right now. No one will notice if you just disappear.~
@61181 = ~I can't do this to you and yet somehow, I am. Hand it over. ~
@61182 = ~I don't. How much is your life worth to you, Officer Riggs?~
@61183 = ~Worth fighting for, I'll tell you that much! ~
@61184 = ~Enough! You made your point. Here, here's everything I took from those lice-ridden beggars. Do with it as you will—just call your god off. I've enough problems in my life without some deity poking their nose into it...~
@61185 = ~Then it looks like we got a problem. But I don't think we'll have one long! ~
@61186 = ~I worked hard for what I got. You want it? Try and take it! ~
@61187 = ~Yeah, right. Not much chance of that now... ~
@61188 = ~Yeah, yeah, I got it. I'm on the straight and narrow now, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. You've put me right, I swear it. Now just—leave me be, yeah?~ [BD61188]
@61189 = ~Just leave me alone. I've had enough of you for one <DAYNIGHTALL>. More than enough.~
@61190 = ~Ah, gods, it never ends with you people. What is it you want now?~ [BD61190]
@61191 = ~Is this the Iron Throne building? ~
@61192 = ~Little enough. Certainly nothing that calls for such acrimony. ~
@61193 = ~Don't take that tone with me, mercenary. ~
@61194 = ~It was. Now it's home to the worthless scum that've overrun the city. ~
@61195 = ~Try to put yourselves in their shoes, my friend. Don't be so quick to judge. ~
@61196 = ~As opposed to the worthless scum that run the city? ~
@61197 = ~They are not without value. The weak always have need of the strong, and the wise strong <PRO_MANWOMAN> can profit greatly from that. ~
@61198 = ~Half of 'em don't even have shoes. The Council of Four should never have let them come here. They'll be the ruin of this city, mark me on that.~ [BD61198]
@61199 = ~I serve the Flaming Fist—I'll take whatever tone I want. Be on your way before I lose my patience.~

@61201 = ~Best show some respect, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. I serve the Flaming Fist. Be on your way. ~
@61202 = ~Aye. You're right about that, I suppose. Have a good <DAYNIGHTALL>. ~
@61203 = ~Oh! It's you—oh, it's YOU! Have you, er, have you had a chance to speak with Riggs about—you know, about what he's been doing yet?~ [BD61203]
@61204 = ~You won't have to worry about him anymore. Here is the gold he stole from you and your fellow refugees. I hope I can trust you to return it to its rightful owners? ~
@61205 = ~I dealt with him, and I got the gold he stole. And by a lucky coincidence, that was the exact amount of gold I'd have asked of you to retrieve it, so we can call it even. You're welcome. ~
@61206 = ~I had words with him. Unfortunately, I was unable to convince him to return what he stole from you. I am very sorry. ~
@61207 = ~I haven't yet, but I will, I assure you. Be patient, my friend. ~
@61208 = ~Speak with whom about what...? ~
@61209 = ~When I do, I will tell you. Until then, pester someone else. ~
@61210 = ~Is this what Baldur's Gate calls a hero, then? We should have taken our chances with Caelar! ~
@61211 = ~Oh, all right. If that's how you're going to be, here, take the gold. I trust you will see it returned to its rightful owners? ~
@61212 = ~Ow. That—that really hurts. It's a good thing I've all this gold I recently acquired to cheer me up. Without it, I might be moved to tears. Or extreme violence. ~
@61213 = ~You have your life, Byzon. But you'll not have it long if you fail to show your superiors the proper respect. ~
@61214 = ~You're nothing more than a common thief, a thug. Well, you've gotten all you can get from us! Be on your way! Find some new victims!~
@61215 = ~Very good, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I'll just—I'll just do that, then. Farewell.~
@61216 = ~Officer Riggs—you know, the Flaming Fist mercenary who's been, uh, taking my money—all of our money—for "protection"...?~
@61217 = ~Ah, yes. No, I haven't had a chance to speak with him yet, but I will, soon. I promise. ~
@61218 = ~Damn me to all Nine Hells, I'd forgotten all about that. Right. I'll get on it immediately. Stay strong, friend. ~
@61219 = ~All your money, you say? And his name is Riggs. I'll speak with him directly. ~
@61220 = ~Show some backbone, man. Fight your own battles. I'll not fight them for you. ~
@61221 = ~Thank you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, thank you and bless you for your help. May Lathander look kindly upon you in all things. ~
@61222 = ~What...? But I—I thought—I guess I don't know what I thought. I thought you—but I was wrong, obviously. Forgive me, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I'll not bother you again.~
@61223 = ~I see. Well, I suppose I shouldn't really have hoped for better. Thank you for trying, <PRO_SIRMAAM>—really. Now please, I'll—I'll need some time to consider what to do now. Farewell.~
@61224 = ~Oh, this is wonderful—wonderful! Thank you so much, <PRO_SIRMAAM>—you've done a great thing this <DAYNIGHTALL>. Bless you! Bless you!~

@61248 = ~You don't say... Huh. There was more to him than I realized. Give me that wineskin. Let's have us a toast to our fallen friend.~
@61249 = ~The tosspot went and got drunk again, didn't he?~
@61250 = ~I'm afraid so, sir.~
@61251 = ~I couldn't say for sure. He was too unconscious for me to tell.~
@61252 = ~I don't ask questions, sir. I just do as I'm told.~
@61253 = ~Do you want the report or not?~
@61254 = ~That wretched sot. Mark my words, recruit, there's no place in the crusade for that kind of weakness. As soon as I finish drink—I mean, reading the report, Sallo and I are going to have a conversation about this, you can believe that.~
@61255 = ~That wretched sot. Mark my words, recruit, there's no place in the crusade for that kind of weakness. As soon as I finish drink—I mean, reading the report, Sallo and I are going to have a conversation about this, you can believe that.~

@61257 = ~Let's see the report—and the wineskin, please. Good. All right, recruit. You're dismissed.~
@61258 = ~He was a good man, Sallo. All right, you've done your job. Dismissed.~
@61259 = ~Good.~
@61260 = ~Damn the report, I want my wine! Go, get it now!~
@61261 = ~It seems to me that Ferrusk is attacking you because you're interfering with his plans. ~
@61262 = ~Of COURSE we're interfering with his plans. He's twisting the forms of innocent creatures! Will you help us stop him?~
@61263 = ~I'm just getting that, sir.~
@61264 = ~Oh, right, the wine. Forgot about that. I'll go fetch it now, shall I?~
@61265 = ~You'll get your wine when I'm good and gods damned ready to get you your bloody wine, you wretched sot.~
@61266 = ~What did you just say to me?~
@61267 = ~Nothing, sir.~
@61268 = ~Uh, forgive me, sir. It's just—with the siege and all, I know Caelar watches over us, but I'm having trouble holding myself together.~
@61269 = ~You heard what I said, you wine-soaked degenerate.~
@61270 = ~It's not easy for any of us, recruit. But when we feel our resolve failing, when we feel we cannot go on, there is always something from which we can draw strength.~

@61277 = ~I was going to say our Shining Lady, Caelar Argent—but a little wine never hurt anyone. Now go fetch mine. It makes reading these gods damned reports tolerable.~
@61278 = ~Um. Yes. Sure. Why not? You have enthusiasm for battle, recruit. That's good, but you need to also have enthusiasm for your assigned duties. Now get me some wine—I think I need a drink.~
@61279 = ~Be quick about it. Reading morning reports is thirsty work.~
@61280 = ~Aye. It better be. Now go do your bloody job and get me my wine.~

I need to get some wine and a report from Deneld and then bring both items to Commander Dreon.

A crusader named Sallo is too drunk to bring the morning report to his commander, Dreon. I have to find a flask, fill it with wine, fetch the report from Morale Officer Deneld, then take both wine and the papers to the Commander.~

I should bring the morning report and a bottle of wine to Commander Dreon.

You know that Jaheira and her husband, Khalid, belong to the secretive order known as the Harpers. Though Jaheira insists she and Khalid were merely taking a vacation near Bridgefort when the crusade arrived and violence ensued, it seems more likely that the Harpers positioned the pair in the area.

Everyone has their own reason for joining the coalition. Vigilant Halasan wants to protect her troops, even if it means fighting an old friend who's joined the crusade.

A man deep in his cups insisted there's an old underground tunnel beneath the Flaming Fist building. He must have been seriously drunk to think the Flaming Fist would permit such an escape route to exist!~
@61557 = ~Duke Entar's daughter has grown up to be quite a handful, I hear.~
@61558 = ~Skie's Grand Plan

Skie Silvershield's name is being bandied about in taverns. Everyone seems to know the duke has trouble controlling his daughter. She's certainly a headstrong young woman who knows what she wants, even if what she wants isn't very wise.~
@61559 = ~Fight broke out here last night. We were able to handle it, and a good thing too. Took hours for the Flaming Fist to arrive, and they only sent one officer! The situation on the streets is getting worse and worse.~
@61560 = ~I've heard tales that Caelar, the leader of this so-called crusade, is really another of those Bhaalspawn! Maybe she was Sarevok's sister. Or his lover!~
@61561 = ~All these refugees are great for business. Everyone needs more of everything for their relatives or people they've taken in. The inns are full to bursting with those that can pay.~
@61562 = ~Seems that faithful of many different religions have joined under the crusade's banner. This Caelar woman claims to be working for the light, but what does that mean? Selûne maybe? No one knows what her plan is.~
@61563 = ~Important Events

Caelar, the leader of the crusade, claims to be on the side of good and backed by the divine, but espouses no particular faith. She makes frequent reference to the "light" but hasn't shared her ultimate plan.~
@61564 = ~I heard a rumor from a peddler who'd come all the way from Aglarond. He said Thay's been pulling their forces in and massing them up. Maybe they're preparing for an attack?~
@61565 = ~They're saying a bunch of barbarians from up north decided to march on Hellgate Keep. What do they hope to accomplish, I wonder? Old haunted places full o' fiends should be left alone, I tell you.~
@61566 = ~Is it possible the crusade will make it all the way to Baldur's Gate? Many of the citizens are worried that we could be facing an attack. The dukes had better come up with a plan to stop this crusade before it gets much farther.~
@61567 = ~Former Flaming Fist members are coming out of retirement to help with the crowds. I heard the Fist might even start hiring mercenaries to help control the chaos in the city. We live in troubled times.~
@61568 = ~Halbazzer Drin at Sorcerous Sundries is completely swamped, I hear. People crowding into his shop day and night. He even had to hire a guard to watch the door and keep the crowds under control!~
@61569 = ~The Sorcerous Sundries Caper

All the businesses in Baldur's Gate are doing a brisk trade, but Sorcerous Sundries seems to be particularly swamped.~
@61570 = ~A traveler stopped in and told us of strange goings-on in Zhentil Keep. He hinted that death and destruction were visiting the Keep's inhabitants. Best stay well away from that dark place.~
@61571 = ~The dukes have appointed the old Iron Throne building as housing for the refugees coming into the city. Some monks have taken over the task of running the shelter, but they're getting overwhelmed by the number of refugees needing a place to sleep.~
@61572 = ~They say the killer of Sarevok is helping the dukes. Is <PRO_HESHE> really on their side, or does the hero of Baldur's Gate have <PRO_HISHER> own agenda? Guess we won't know until it's too late. Say, you look familiar...~
@61573 = ~I heard this "Shining Lady" or whatever she calls herself isn't a servant of good at all. She's a fiend in disguise is what she is. Or she serves a fiend. Perhaps several fiends! There are definitely fiends involved, at any rate. I'm sure of it.~
@61574 = ~Important Events

No one seems sure who Caelar of the crusade really is or what her motivation is. Some now claim that she is, or is allied with, fiends.~
@61575 = ~Word from Chondath is that Garagos, the Reaver, has reappeared! Most thought him killed by Tempus long ago. Seems it's hard to kill a god for good.~
@61576 = ~A crazy elf hangs out in the taproom of the Elfsong Tavern. No one can make sense out of anything he says. So long as he pays fairly, I suppose there's no trouble.~
@61577 = ~Zaviak's Vision Quest

The Elfsong Tavern has acquired an eccentric patron, an elf who talks nonsense.~
@61578 = ~Recruitment Drive

Corwin will wait for me at the entrance to the Three Old Kegs.

Captain Corwin knows the city well. With the streets as crowded as they are, I thought it would take far longer to reach the Three Old Kegs than it did with her guiding me. She's waiting for me at the Three Old Kegs front doors while I look around. When I'm ready to go, she'll follow me out the door.~
@61579 = ~Schael Corwin

I thought I'd have a drink with Captain Corwin.

I would know more of Captain Schael Corwin. Hopefully, a drink or two will soften her disposition.~
@61580 = ~My Missed Fortune

I should meet the treasurer outside the palace main door.

I've just learned from the palace's treasurer, Ophyllis, that the gold I gave him for safekeeping has been lost. He claims he can repay me. I hope he's right. He'll meet me outside the palace with my gold once he recovers it.~
@61581 = ~My Missed Fortune

I should meet the treasurer outside the palace main door.

I've just learned from the palace's treasurer, Ophyllis, that the gold I gave him for safekeeping has been lost. He claims he can repay me. He'd better be right, for his sake. He'll meet me outside the palace with my gold once he recovers it.~
@61582 = ~My Missed Fortune

I should meet the treasurer outside the palace main door.

I've just learned from the palace's treasurer, Ophyllis, that the gold I gave him for safekeeping has been lost. I've sent him to Duke Belt to receive proper punishment for his negligence. After that, he'll meet me outside the palace with my gold once he recovers it.~
@61583 = ~My Missed Fortune

I should search the Three Old Kegs for the people who attacked Ophyllis.

The palace treasurer, Ophyllis, battered and bloody, intercepted me outside the High Hall. He was assaulted by thieves, who made off with the gold he owed me. He believes his attackers can be found in the Three Old Kegs.~
@61584 = ~My Missed Fortune

I should search the Three Old Kegs for the people who attacked Ophyllis.

The palace treasurer, Ophyllis, intercepted me outside the High Hall. He claimed he was assaulted by thieves, who made off with the gold he owed me, and further claimed I can find those who attacked him in the Three Old Kegs inn. If he is lying, the blood he's shed thus far will seem like mere droplets from the lightest smattering of rain—I shall unleash upon him a storm, a typhoon of agony and death.~
@61585 = ~My Missed Fortune

I should search the Three Old Kegs for the people who attacked Ophyllis.

The palace treasurer, Ophyllis, intercepted me outside the High Hall. He was assaulted by thieves, who made off with the gold he owed me. He believed his attackers can be found in the Three Old Kegs. Whether that is true or not, my patience with him was at an end. He paid the ultimate price for his failures.~
@61586 = ~My Missed Fortune

It seems my gold is lost to me.

I found the band of ruffians who robbed Ophyllis on the second floor of the Three Old Kegs. They apologized but explained that the gold had been put to use feeding and sheltering those taking refuge from Caelar's campaign in the city. I could not in good conscience ask them to return the gold—not that they had it anymore, anyway.~
@61587 = ~My Missed Fortune

It seems my gold is lost to me.

I found the band of ruffians who robbed Ophyllis on the second floor of the Three Old Kegs. The scum had used my gold to feed and shelter those taking refuge from Caelar's campaign in the city. In the end, I may have lost my money, but those fools lost far more.~
@61588 = ~My Missed Fortune

I should watch for Ophyllis, in case he tries to repay me again.

Ophyllis, one of the treasurers at the Ducal Palace in Baldur's Gate, is determined to repay me for the gold of mine he lost. To that end, he's given me a bust of my own head, cast in gold. I told him to stop attempting to repay me. I hope he takes my words to heart.~
@61589 = ~My Missed Fortune

I should watch for Ophyllis, in case he tries to repay me again.

Ophyllis, one of the treasurers at the Ducal Palace in Baldur's Gate, is determined to repay me for the gold of mine he lost. To that end, he's given me a bust of my own head, cast in gold. He's trying, I have to give him that.~
@61590 = ~My Missed Fortune

It seems my gold is lost to me for good.

Ophyllis, one of the treasurers at the Ducal Palace in Baldur's Gate, was determined to repay me for the gold of mine he lost. To that end, he gave me a bust of my own head, cast in gold. I killed him. Some folk are better off dead; those who annoy me rank highly among them.~
@61591 = ~My Missed Fortune

I should watch for the crusaders that slew Ophyllis.

Ophyllis has died trying to return my gold. If I wish to regain my lost fortune, I must seek out the crusaders who slew him.~
@61592 = ~The War at Home~
@61593 = ~The War At Home

I should try to cheer Jospil up.

A man named Jospil asked me to give him a moment before speaking to him. He seems very depressed. Perhaps I can do something to improve his morale.~
@61594 = ~The War At Home

I've learned something of the crusade from Jospil.

Jospil told me about the crusade and the Shining Lady, Caelar Argent. I was able to turn his attitude around. He gave me a shield and a quarterstaff as thanks.~
@61595 = ~The War At Home

I've learned something of the crusade from Jospil.

Jospil told me about the crusade and the Shining Lady, Caelar Argent. I was able to cheer him up a bit. He gave me a quarterstaff as a token of his appreciation.~
@61596 = ~The War At Home

I've learned something of the crusade from Jospil.

Jospil told me about the crusade and the Shining Lady, Caelar Argent. He is a melancholy man, with a bleak view of our chances to defeat the crusade.~
@61597 = ~Bar Fight~
@61598 = ~Bar Fight

I could talk to the bartender or one of the captains if I want to put a stop to this fight.

Seems like a bar fight is brewing in the Three Old Kegs. I could talk to the barkeep, or try to intervene between the two parties if I want.~
@61599 = ~Bar Fight

I managed to defuse a potential bar fight in the Three Old Kegs. 

Nantrin Bellowglym, the owner of the inn, usually doesn't permit fighting and more than one rowdy patron's been thrown out of the bar. When he saw me, though, Bellowglym asked me to intervene and said he'd trust me to handle the situation. My face is more well known than I thought.~
@61600 = ~Bar Fight

I should ask Lucilla about a reward.

A bar fight was brewing in the Three Old Kegs, but I stepped in before things got too out of hand. I sided with Lucilla, the navigator of the "Amnian Delight." I should ask her about a reward.~
@61601 = ~Bar Fight

I should ask Autinn about a reward.

A bar fight was brewing in the Three Old Kegs, but I stepped in before things got too out of hand. I sided with Autinn, first mate of "Chiondar's Son." I should ask him about a reward.~
@61602 = ~Bar Fight

I stepped in to settle a bar fight and was rewarded for my actions.

Lucilla rewarded me with an enchanted cudgel for assisting her in the bar fight. I consider myself repaid.~
@61603 = ~Bar Fight

I stepped in to settle a bar fight and was rewarded for my actions.

Autinn rewarded me with an enchanted scimitar for assisting him in the bar fight. I consider myself repaid.~
@61604 = ~Meeting of the Minds~
@61605 = ~Meeting of the Minds

I should talk to Corwin to have the nobles arrested.

I managed to convince three nobles plotting against the city I shared their views. Now I'll get Corwin and have her arrest them.~
@61606 = ~Meeting of the Minds

I uncovered a seditious plot and used it to my advantage. 

I've extorted what I could from the traitorous nobles. They should learn to be more careful when they plot.~
@61607 = ~Meeting of the Minds

I uncovered a seditious plot and executed justice on the traitors. 

I've put an end to the traitorous nobles' plot. They will not undermine the security of Baldur's Gate.~
@61608 = ~Meeting of the Minds

I need to trick the nobles into saying something treasonous.

Corwin's bringing a Flaming Fist team to wait in the hallway outside the nobles' room. I must trick the plotters into discussing their seditious plans again.~
@61609 = ~Meeting of the Minds

I uncovered a seditious plot and put an end to it.

Corwin got the evidence she needed. The seditious nobles have been arrested.~
@61610 = ~Meeting of the Minds

I uncovered a seditious plot, but the best I could do was to scare away the plotters.

I couldn't get the nobles to implicate themselves. Corwin had to let them go.~
@61611 = ~What? Get Out!~
@61612 = ~Zaviak's Vision Quest~
@61613 = ~Zaviak's Vision Quest

A creature called an Endless Watcher appeared and said I had released its prisoner, Zhadroth. 

I explained to the Endless Watcher that Zhadroth was dead, and the creature left me in peace.~
@61614 = ~Zaviak's Vision Quest

I used the spectacles to draw a deva into Avernus. 

It was quite amusing to watch the angel flop around in a panic. When her antics grew tiresome, I ended her.~
@61615 = ~Zaviak's Vision Quest

I used the spectacles to draw a deva into Avernus. 

I didn't realize the damage I was doing, and the deva was understandably horrified at finding herself in Hell. I swore I had no intention to harm her, and the deva was magnanimous about the situation, even helping me fight off some demons.~
@61616 = ~Zaviak's Vision Quest

The Spectacles of Spectacle are out of charges. 

The creatures I did see were unusual, dangerous, and fascinating. Zaviak may be a strange character, but his glasses worked and they did open my mind to some degree.~
@61617 = ~Days of Wine and Stealing~
@61618 = ~Tome of Great Value~
@61619 = ~Recruitment Drive

Corwin tells me the bard Garrick has spent much time in the Elfsong Tavern of late. 

I'm not sure why Garrick is at the Elfsong Tavern. It's a strange place for a bard to frequent; only the ghost of the elf for which the tavern is named may sing within its walls.~
@61620 = ~Recruitment Drive

Unfortunately—or perhaps fortunately—the bard Garrick is too smitten with the Elfsong Tavern's owner to accompany me on the trek to Dragonspear.~
@61621 = ~Recruitment Drive

Tiax will not join me.

Tiax declined my invitation to leave his cell at the Flaming Fist headquarters and join me in confronting Caelar. This is regrettable... but not that regrettable.~
@61622 = ~Recruitment Drive

Tiax will not join me.

I can't believe I considered bringing that ranting lunatic Tiax on my journey to Dragonspear. What was I thinking? Was I thinking? Why wasn't I thinking? I've got to think if I'm to end Caelar's reign of terror.~
@61623 = ~Recruitment Drive

Rasaad will not join me.

Rasaad, currently working at the Iron Throne tending to refugees, has rejected my invitation to accompany me on the journey north to Dragonspear. He has personal business to attend to that takes precedence even over ending the threat of Caelar.~
@61624 = ~Schael Corwin

I shared a drink with Captain Corwin. 

I didn't learn much about Corwin. She seems to keep her private life strictly private. I'm not sure if she learned any more about me, but she seems willing to work with me to end this crusade business.~
@61625 = ~Sarevok's Servant~
@61626 = ~Sarevok's Servant

I must defeat Korlasz once again.

Sarevok's servant, the mage Korlasz, is loose in the Ducal Palace. If I don't stop her, she'll take revenge on me for my role in her capture and Sarevok's death—and on the city for the torments she claims to have suffered in captivity.~
@61627 = ~Sarevok's Servant

Korlasz is finished forever.

In the Ducal Palace's basement, I once again crossed paths with the magician Korlasz, a former lieutenant of the Iron Throne. She survived our first encounter; on this occasion I was left with little choice but to kill her.~
@61628 = ~The Fist Restrained~
@61629 = ~The Fist Restrained

I need to find a way to free the imprisoned Flaming Fist officer.

A Flaming Fist officer has been accidentally locked in a cell in the Ducal Palace. I must free him.~
@61630 = ~The False Fist~
@61631 = ~The Fist Restrained

I've slain a doppelganger impersonating a Flaming Fist soldier.

The "officer" I freed from the cell was a doppelganger! I managed to slay the creature.~
@61632 = ~The Fist Restrained

I freed the unlucky officer from his cell and sent him on his way.~
@61633 = ~The False Fist

I should rendezvous with a doppelganger in the Iron Throne building basement.

The doppelganger I freed from the Ducal Palace has promised me a reward if I meet it in the basement of the Iron Throne building.~
@61634 = ~The False Fist

The doppelganger I freed has rewarded me.

The doppelganger I freed from the Ducal Palace dungeons was as good as its word. I have let it go and in exchange have acquired a significant cache of gold, weapons, and potions.~
@61635 = ~The False Fist

The doppelganger I freed rewarded me and is now dead by my hand.

The doppelganger I freed from the Ducal Palace dungeons was as good as its word. I acquired its cache of gold, weapons, and potions, then slew the beast, preferring to not have a changeling at large that might bear me ill will.~
@61636 = ~Back on the Streets~
@61637 = ~Back on the Streets

A fallen paladin named Dauston accosted me, but I went on my way.

Outside the Flaming Fist jail, I met a fallen paladin of Lathander, Dauston, formerly of the Order of the Aster. He's naught but a pathetic drunkard now. I bid him leave me to my own devices.~
@61638 = ~Back on the Streets

A fallen paladin named Dauston told me a bit about Aun Argent.

Outside the Flaming Fist jail, I met a fallen paladin of Lathander, Dauston, formerly of the Order of the Aster, He told—started to tell—the tale of his master, one Aun Argent. Once a great paladin, Aun somehow fell from grace. It seems to have had something to do with Caelar, but before I could hear the whole of the tale, Dauston collapsed.~
@61639 = ~Caelar will fall, and all her crusaders with her. I'll see to that. As for you, you'll be hanged for treason.~
@61640 = ~You've really drunk the wine she's pouring, haven't you? ~

@61643 = ~Tongue of Acid +3~
@61644 = ~This infernal longsword, forged to resemble a devil's tongue, has a blade "sharper than any scream" according to the writing on the hilt. Its edge cuts easily through armor and bone and leaves acid sizzling in the wounds it inflicts. The pain its wounds inflict is so severe that its victims have difficulty functioning, even walking, due to the agony.

@61652 = ~Breaking Curfew

I should talk to this Byzon about his problems.

@61655 = ~Shakedown in Shantytown

I should talk to this Byzon about his problems.

In the shantytown that's sprung up around the former Iron Throne building, I encountered a Flaming Fist mercenary talking with a refugee who claimed to have lost his cat in the chaos that's filled Baldur's Gate since Caelar's crusade began to march. He was clearly lying; there is more going on here, though finding out what may prove difficult.~
@61656 = ~Shakedown in Shantytown

I could talk to Byzon about his problems, if I wanted to.

In the shantytown that's sprung up around the former Iron Throne building, I encountered a Flaming Fist mercenary talking with a refugee who claimed to have lost his cat in the chaos that's filled Baldur's Gate since Caelar's crusade began to march. He was clearly lying about the cat, but I've little interest in another's problems. I've enough of my own to contend with.~
@61657 = ~Shakedown in Shantytown

I should look for Flaming Fist officer Riggs.

I must find a Flaming Fist officer named Riggs and convince him to cease extorting money from those seeking refuge in Baldur's Gate.~
@61658 = ~Shakedown in Shantytown

I can give the gold back to Byzon now.

I have retrieved the gold the mercenary Riggs stole from the refugees around the Iron Throne building. If I give the gold to Byzon, he should be able to return it to Riggs's other victims.~
@61659 = ~Shakedown in Shantytown

I can give the gold back to Byzon now.

With Captain Corwin's assistance, I have retrieved the gold the mercenary Riggs stole from the refugees around the Iron Throne building. If I give the gold to Byzon, he should be able to return it to Riggs's other victims.~
@61660 = ~Shakedown in Shantytown

I've slain Riggs as he would not turn over his bounty.

The mercenary Riggs would not willingly surrender the gold he extorted from those refugees of Caelar's crusade he was charged to protect. I was left with little choice but to slay him.~
@61661 = ~Shakedown in Shantytown

Byzon has gotten his money back.

I gave the gold stolen from the refugees round the Iron Throne building to Byzon. He will ensure each of Riggs's victims receives their proper share.~
@61662 = ~Shakedown in Shantytown

I kept the money I retrieved from Riggs.

I retrieved the gold stolen from the refugees round the Iron Throne building from the mercenary Riggs. I considered returning it to Byzon and the rest of Riggs's victims—but I didn't consider it long. It will do me more good in my pocket than in theirs.~
@61663 = ~Refuge for the Refugees~
@61664 = ~Refuge for the Refugees

I could go to the Flaming Fist headquarters and ask about Garachen, or I could go to the Elfsong Tavern to secure more provisions for him.

Garachen, a homeowner with a large house near the Ducal Palace, has been taking everything refugees have in exchange for lodging. He claims he will open his house if I secure provisions from the Elfsong Tavern. A refugee named Perren mentioned several lodgers had left for the Iron Throne. I wonder if this is worth mentioning to the Flaming Fist?~
@61665 = ~Refuge for the Refugees

I should bring the provender to Garachen.

I secured provender enough for a week of meals for Garachen.~
@61666 = ~Refuge for the Refugees

I should go talk to the refugees outside Garachen's house.

There was no legal action I could take against Garachen, so I resorted to less savory methods. I convinced the Flaming Fist that Garachen was selling refugees into slavery. When they finish their investigation, they'll find no evidence against him, of course, but in the meantime, the refugees will be free to use his house.~
@61667 = ~Refuge for the Refugees

Garachen has been taken away and the refugees will sleep easy.

I was able to frame Garachen for slavery. He was arrested and carted off to jail. He'll be released eventually, I'm sure, but in the meantime the refugees can use his house freely. Garachen could use a little time in jail to think about his life.~
@61668 = ~Refuge for the Refugees

I brought supplies to Garachen and he will use them to help the refugees.

Garachen claimed he couldn't afford to open his house to everyone, and I have to admit it is reasonable for him to want compensation for the service he provides. I brought him supplies from the Elfsong Tavern that should keep him going for a few weeks at least.~

@61671 = ~All the Way to the Bank

I can either pay the moneylender myself or return to Teera and tell her the bad news.

A pickpocket stole Teera's earnings. I'll have to give the moneylender my own gold in replacement or return to Teera and tell her what happened.~
@61672 = ~All the Way to the Bank

I should hurry to the moneylender to deliver this purse.

A pickpocket targeted me, but I noticed her attempt and fought back.~
@61673 = ~All the Way to the Bank

I should tell Teera the good news.

I successfully deposited Teera's earnings. I should tell her that the matter is handled. Her stall was outside the Ducal Palace.~
@61674 = ~All the Way to the Bank

Teera was pleased that I deposited her money successfully.~
@61675 = ~All the Way to the Bank

Teera was very upset that I lost her money.~
@61676 = ~Rabble-Rousers~
@61677 = ~Rabble-Rousers

I should go to the Flaming Fist headquarters for reinforcements.

Officer Vida of the Flaming Fist has a group of refugees detained outside Sorcerous Sundries. She needs the Flaming Fist HQ to send reinforcements.~
@61678 = ~Rabble-Rousers

I should return to Officer Vida outside Sorcerous Sundries.

I alerted the Flaming Fist to Officer Vida's need for reinforcements. I should let her know.~
@61679 = ~Rabble-Rousers

I've asked the Flaming Fist to show the refugees leniency.

After giving the matter much thought, I decided to intervene on the detained refugees' behalf. They are under more stress than we can comprehend, and we must show them compassion.~
@61680 = ~Rabble-Rousers

I believe the refugees deserved the punishment they received.

After giving the matter much thought, I decided to side with Officer Vida and request the refugees receive a strict punishment. If everyone were to behave like them, the city would descend into chaos.~
@61681 = ~The Dry Crier~
@61682 = ~The Dry Crier

I should talk to Katheera inside the Three Old Kegs.

The crier outside the Three Old Kegs is parched. I need to ask Katheera inside the inn if she'll send out a soothing drink for the crier.~
@61683 = ~The Dry Crier

I should talk to Robel, the crier outside the Three Old Kegs.

Katheera is quite busy, but she will send a drink out to Robel when she can. I should let him know.~
@61684 = ~The Dry Crier

I should talk to Robel, the crier outside the Three Old Kegs.

I convinced Katheera to send a drink out right away, even though the inn is very busy. I should let Robel know.~
@61685 = ~The Dry Crier

I relayed Katheera's message to Robel. He's looking forward to receiving his drink.~
@61686 = ~Corpse Disposal~
@61687 = ~Corpse Disposal

I could give Aileen, behind the Three Old Kegs, 15 gold to pay for a funeral.

A woman in the alley behind the Three Old Kegs is raising money to pay for her cousin's burial. She still needs 15 gp.~
@61688 = ~Corpse Disposal

I gave Aileen the 15 gp she needed to pay for her cousin's burial. ~
@61689 = ~Corpse Disposal

I agreed not to report the corpse in the cart.

The dead man next to Aileen was her drunken brute of a husband, whom she accidentally killed during an argument. I promised to keep her secret.~
@61690 = ~Corpse Disposal

I could tell Aileen I'll keep her secret or I could report her at Flaming Fist headquarters.

The dead man next to Aileen was her drunken brute of a husband, whom she accidentally killed during an argument. I'm not sure if I should keep her secret or go to the Flaming Fist headquarters building and tell one of the officers inside.~
@61691 = ~Corpse Disposal

Aileen paid me to keep her secret safe.

The dead man next to Aileen was her drunken brute of a husband, whom she accidentally killed during an argument. I promised to keep her secret... in exchange for all the money she had accumulated to pay for his disposal.~
@61692 = ~Corpse Disposal

I reported the murder of Aileen's husband to the Flaming Fist.~
@61693 = ~The Sorcerous Sundries Caper~
@61694 = ~The Sorcerous Sundries Caper

I should go upstairs in Sorcerous Sundries and look for potion bottles.

Halbazzer Drin wants a case of empty potion bottles from the upstairs level of Sorcerous Sundries.~
@61695 = ~The Sorcerous Sundries Caper

Drin rewarded me for stopping a robbery.

I stopped a group of robbers from making off with Halbazzer Drin's goods. I let Drin know, and he was very grateful for my intervention.~
@61696 = ~Thief Among the Refugees~
@61697 = ~Thief Among the Refugees

I lacked the evidence to pronounce Lon guilty.

Lon, a refugee, was accused of stealing an amulet. The evidence was insufficient to convince me of his guilt, though.~
@61698 = ~Thief Among the Refugees

I should talk to Berta about this horrible experience.

Lon, a refugee at the Iron Throne building, stole a holy symbol of Selûne. When his crime was exposed, Lon transformed into a werewolf. I was forced to dispatch him.~
@61699 = ~Thief Among the Refugees

I should talk to Berta about this horrible experience.

Lon, a refugee at the Iron Throne building, was a werewolf hiding in human form. I discovered his true nature and dispatched him before he could hurt anyone.~
@61700 = ~Thief Among the Refugees

Berta gave me her holy symbol in thanks for protecting the refugees from Lon, the werewolf.~
@61701 = ~Unexpected Allies

Rasaad has joined my company.

Rasaad is with me after all. It's good to have another ally at my side. I have a feeling I'll need all I can get. If I dismiss Rasaad, he will wait for me at the Flaming Fist camp.~
@61702 = ~Unexpected Allies

Rasaad waits at the Flaming Fist camp.

Rasaad changed his mind about joining me, but I also changed my mind about wanting him in my party. I told him I would press on without him. He will wait for me at the Flaming Fist camp.~
@61703 = ~Unexpected Allies

Baeloth now travels with me.

Baeloth, the flamboyant drow sorcerer, has offered to be my ally. I'm not sure I can trust the drow—actually, I'm fairly certain I can't trust him—but I can't deny his utility. If I dismiss Baeloth, he will wait for me at the Flaming Fist camp.~
@61704 = ~Unexpected Allies

Baeloth will wait near the arena to the northwest.

Baeloth, the flamboyant drow sorcerer, offered to be my ally. I turned him down. It's important that I'm able to rely on my allies, and Baeloth is patently unreliable. I can find him again at the pit-fighting area to the northwest.~
@61705 = ~M'Khiin Grubdoubler

M'Khiin has joined my company.

This is indeed unexpected. I met a goblin named M'Khiin fighting in Baeloth's "pit." She seemed a tenacious sort, and so I asked her to join my party. I wonder what consequences this will have. Most goblins don't travel openly. I'll have to watch out for her. If I dismiss M'Khiin, she'll wait for me at the Flaming Fist camp.~
@61706 = ~M'Khiin Grubdoubler

M'Khiin waits at the arena to the northwest.

This is indeed unexpected. I met a goblin named M'Khiin fighting in Baeloth's "pit." She seemed a tenacious sort, but I decided it was too risky to have her in my party. Most goblins don't travel openly because they are so hated and feared. I can find her in the pit-fighting area to the northwest.~
@61707 = ~Halfling Treasures~
@61708 = ~Isabella and Ikros~
@61709 = ~Isabella and Ikros

I should talk to Isabella about the vampire.

I almost had him! The vampire seemed defeated—then he turned into a cloud of mist and escaped through the trees. It appears I have more hunting to do. I should talk to Isabella about Tsolak's escape.~
@61710 = ~Isabella and Ikros

I should watch for the vampire's messenger.

I was set to hunt the vampire when it started explaining its position. Its arguments were compelling. In the end, I sided with Tsolak against the hunters. I'm to watch for its messenger and a reward.~
@61711 = ~Isabella and Ikros

Isabella and Ikros are dead, as is their vampire prey.~
@61712 = ~Isabella and Ikros

I should find the vampire's cave and stake the creature.

I need to find the vampire Tsolak's body and drive a stake through his heart. Traps line a path to the west, and it seems likely that the vampire lairs beyond this dangerous zone.~

@61714 = ~Isabella and Ikros

If I return to the hunters' camp, I may gain a reward.

With a single swift motion, I impaled the vampire's corpse. All the vitality leached out of it at once, and what was left of the body sagged in upon itself. I should return to the hunters' camp.~
@61715 = ~Isabella and Ikros

I have received my promised reward from the vampire.

I expected the vampire Tsolak might betray me and was prepared to battle him after all. My suspicions proved unfounded, though. A messenger just arrived with a reward from Tsolak. It's a strange world where a vampire can be so trustworthy.~
@61716 = ~Isabella and Ikros

I've finished my dealings with the vampire hunters.

I aided the hunters as I promised I would. The vampire Tsolak is no more, and I have my reward. It feels good to have rid the world of such evil.~
@61717 = ~Isabella and Ikros

I've finished my dealings with the vampire hunters.

I aided the hunters as I promised I would. The vampire Tsolak is no more, and I have my reward. which is the only reason I bothered in the first place. This was a job well done.~
@61718 = ~Ancient Menhirs~
@61719 = ~Ancient Menhirs

I need to find all six ancient menhirs in the area.

To unlock the mystery of the musical menhirs and discover what their purpose is, I must first find all the ancient menhirs in the area, then sing to them until they emit a pleasing tone.~
@61720 = ~The Vanished~
@61721 = ~The Vanished

I should talk to Teleria in the refugee camp about the missing refugees.

Several refugees have gone missing and suspicion is cast on an elf who arrived recently. I should talk to Teleria and see if she knows anything about the missing refugees.~
@61722 = ~The Vanished

I should go to the clearing to the west to meet Teleria.

Teleria is going to meet me in a clearing nearby and tell me what she knows.~
@61723 = ~The Vanished

I need to find a soldier and a nobleman and lure them to Teleria's clearing. 

Once I find the missing subjects for Teleria, her art collection will be complete and she will reward me.~
@61724 = ~The Vanished

I should restore the petrified statues, if I can, and then return to Herod at the refugee camp.

Teleria was so obsessed with her "art" that she was willing to sacrifice innocent lives. Now she has been stopped; the refugee camp is safe. I'll return to Herod and tell him what I've learned.~
@61725 = ~The Vanished

I need to find a nobleman for Teleria.

I need to find a soldier and a nobleman and lure them to Teleria's clearing. I've already found a soldier.~
@61726 = ~The Vanished

I should return to Teleria in the western clearing.

Now that I've secured both a soldier and a nobleman, I should return to Teleria.~
@61727 = ~The Vanished

I need to find a soldier for Teleria.

I need to find a soldier and a nobleman and lure them to Teleria's clearing. I've already found a noble.~

I should return to Teleria in the western clearing.

I should return to Teleria now that I've secured both a soldier and a nobleman.~
@61729 = ~The Vanished

I provided Teleria with acceptable subjects and obtained a reward.~
@61730 = ~The False Fist

I should go to the Iron Throne basement in three hours.

A doppelganger masquerading as a Flaming Fist officer has promised me a great reward for freeing it. I must meet it in the basement of the Iron Throne building in three hours.~

I spoke to Wynan Hess and now I must find and speak with Jegg Hillcarver.

I found Wynan Hess within the walls of Bridgefort. He relays that our troops are small; most of the people trapped inside the keep are merchants and travelers. We need to coordinate with the Flaming Fist if we're to attack the crusade with a hope of success. I still need to talk to the smith, Jegg Hillcarver.~
@61739 = ~The Creeping Darkness

Once I destroy this dark wraith, Bridgefort will be safe from the spellstone.

Vichand left a trap on the spellstone. Neutralizing its dark energy released a terrifying wraith. If I can destroy it, Bridgefort will be safe—as safe as it can be, considering.~
@61740 = ~The Fear~
@61741 = ~The Fear

I could talk to Elandro and try to calm him down.

I encountered two magicians in Bridgefort's courtyard. They seem to be here by chance more than anything. One mage, Elandro, is terrified of crusader attacks and death. The other mage, Thirrim, cautioned me that Elandro's fear could draw in evil creatures, especially if Elandro panics at night. I should keep this in mind.~
@61742 = ~The Fear

I could talk to Elandro and try to calm him down.

I met the magicians Thirrim and Elandro in the Bridgefort courtyard. If they're a fair representation of those who seek refuge here, then fear festers within these walls. In time, it will do the crusade's work for them. I hope the morale of this place can still improve.~
@61743 = ~The Fear

I should talk to Elandro tonight and try to calm him down.

The mage Thirrim asked me to speak to the mage Elandro at night. He seems to think Elandro's fears might be amplified in the darkness and might call unwanted creatures to our encampment. I should talk to Elandro tonight and be prepared for danger.~
@61744 = ~The Fear

I've defeated the feyr that formed in the courtyard.

The magical energy enveloping Bridgefort combined with the anxieties and fears of those within it, spawning a hideous monster I had little choice but to slay. If only personal anxieties were so easy to defeat.~
@61745 = ~The Fear

I've defeated the feyr that formed in the courtyard.

The magical energy enveloping Bridgefort combined with the anxieties and fears of those within it, spawning a hideous monster that would have slain all around it were I not present. These cowards are their own worst enemy.~
@61746 = ~The Fear

I've helped Elandro deal with his anxieties.

Elandro's fears almost overtook him, but I was able to calm him down. Now that he has gotten a handle on his emotions, any danger is over.~
@61747 = ~Food Fight~
@61748 = ~Food Fight

I should talk to the people inside Bridgefort and try to determine who stole food from the stores.

Morale among Bridgefort's defenders is understandably low. Bad enough they face an overwhelming foe, but now they're turning on themselves. I witnessed two defenders accuse a third of stealing food from the stores. I forestalled violence by promising to investigate the theft, but I don't know how long it will be before someone in these walls breaks.~
@61749 = ~Food Fight

I should talk to the people inside Bridgefort and try to determine who stole food from the stores.

Morale among Bridgefort's defenders is understandably low. Bad enough they face an overwhelming foe, but now they're turning on themselves. It is most entertaining—and possibly quite lucrative.~
@61750 = ~Food Fight

Someone has been stealing food from the Bridgefort stores.

Morale among Bridgefort's defenders is understandably low. Bad enough they face an overwhelming foe, but now they're turning on themselves. It is most entertaining.~
@61751 = ~Food Fight

I should continue investigating the missing food and talk to the suspects when I know whom to accuse.

I spoke with Harth, one of those who accused Mattroun of stealing food from Bridgefort's stores. Though he clearly has an axe to grind, preferably in Mattroun's skull, he makes a compelling case for the man's guilt.~
@61752 = ~Food Fight

I should continue investigating the missing food and talk to the suspects when I know whom to accuse.

I spoke with Harth, one of those who accused Mattroun of stealing food from Bridgefort's stores. He gave me the gift of some gold and potions; I gave him the gift of not accusing him of being the thief he accuses Mattroun of being.~
@61753 = ~Food Fight

I should continue investigating the missing food and talk to the suspects when I know whom to accuse.

Taryl of Bridgefort is completely convinced Mattroun is guilty of stealing the missing food. I'm not so sure, but I'm also not so sure that she'll await my judgmentbefore acting on her beliefs.~
@61754 = ~Food Fight

I should continue investigating the missing food and talk to the suspects when I know whom to accuse.

Taryl of Bridgefort knows how this game is played. She didn't blink when I threatened to accuse her of theft, paying me what I demanded without hesitation. She is a formidable woman by almost any measure.~
@61755 = ~Food Fight

I should continue investigating the missing food and talk to the suspects when I know whom to accuse.

In retrospect, trying to extort money from a highly volatile person like Taryl of Bridgefort might not have been the wisest of ideas. A fight broke out and I had to end her life.~
@61756 = ~Food Fight

I should continue investigating the missing food and talk to the suspects when I know whom to accuse.

Mattroun of Bridgefort insists on his innocence, despite of seemingly overwhelming evidence against him—evidence he freely admits to, even while maintaining his innocence. A curious situation.~
@61757 = ~Food Fight

I should examine this area for clues.

Wessel, the guard watching over Bridgefort's supply room, had little insight to offer me in the matter of Mattroun and the missing ham. I'm going to examine the area, in the hopes of uncovering some evidence of Mattroun's innocence or guilt.~
@61758 = ~~
@61759 = ~Food Fight

I should return to Harth, Taryl, or Mattroun to put the matter of the thief to rest.

I've discovered that the culprit behind the theft of the ham was a mongrel that Frair Tajik adopted. Tajik was terified that I'd turn the dog in and that the others would kill the beast. I promised to find a way to help the dog.~
@61760 = ~Food Fight

I should return to Harth, Taryl, or Mattroun to put the matter of the thief to rest.

A stray dog that Frair Tajik has adopted was the culprit behind the ham theft. I'm sympathetic to the man's plight but a single animal cannot be given more consideration than the hard-pressed defenders of the fort.~
@61761 = ~Food Fight

I should return to Harth, Taryl, or Mattroun to put the matter of the thief to rest.

A stray dog that Frair Tajik has adopted was the culprit behind the ham theft. I agreed to keep his secret in exchange for payment.~

@61765 = ~Delicious Horsels

The situation in Bridgefort is dire. I encountered a half-elf teamster, Senderin, and her son. Both are clearly feeling the ravages of hunger. But their concern is for their horses, who have fallen sick in the confines of the fort's courtyard. I need to find the cleric Frair Tajik and convince him to heal the horses.~
@61766 = ~Delicious Horsels

The situation in Bridgefort is dire. I encountered a half-elf teamster, Senderin, and her son. Both are clearly feeling the ravages of hunger, but care more for the health of their horses. I shall attempt to cure the beast.~
@61767 = ~Delicious Horsels

After all the effort it took to convince Frair Tajik to heal the half-elf Senderin's horses, I learn that she and her son plan to butcher them for meat. I'm not sure how I feel about this.~
@61768 = ~Delicious Horsels

After all the effort it took to heal the half-elf Senderin's horses, I have learned that she and her son plan to use them for meat, rather than transportation. I did receive a rather handsome helm, though. It wasn't a complete waste.~
@61769 = ~Glint Gardnersonson

The gnome, Glint, waits at the Flaming Fist camp.

A most interesting fellow has insinuated himself in the Flaming Fist caravan, apparently with no one in the caravan noticing. His name is Glint "Three-Eyes" Gardnersonson. He's heading into crusade territory seeking news of his relatives. If I need him, I can find him at the Flaming Fist camp. ~

@61771 = ~Beetles and Spiders

I've collected spider eggs in case I need them later.

I have collected a few of the eggs spread throughout the cavern. Spiders have no familial bond, so the eggs' mother will not miss them overmuch. I'm not sure what I will do with these things—only certain species of giant insect find them desirable as foodstuffs. But nature provides nothing that is without purpose. I will find a use for them in time, I'm sure.~
@61772 = ~Beetles and Spiders

I'd better find the source of the noise in the spider cave.

Something has entered the spider cave. It sounds like something big. I should find the source of the noise.~

I discovered a giant rhino beetle was making all the noise in the caverns.~
@61774 = ~The Irregulars~
@61775 = ~The Irregulars

I'm to pick a fight with half-orc mercenaries in the area.

A member of the Flaming Fist, Lieutenant Otilda, asked me to pick a fight with a group of mercenary half-orcs. Otilda thinks the half-orcs can't be trusted, and by fighting them, I'll get them banished from camp.~
@61776 = ~The Irregulars

I should return to Lieutenant Otilda and tell her what I've done.

@61819 = ~Kanaglym: The Abandoned City~
@61820 = ~Around 722 DR, three clans of dwarves united ventured below the High Moor, where they discovered a series of caverns well-suited for founding a new town. The dwarves chipped away the walls between the smaller caverns, creating a large new space for the town they named Kanaglym. The clans enjoyed little peace in their new home, for only a few months after they began construction, they were attacked by a drow force. The drow opened a portal from their home city of Zanhoriloch, hoping to catch the dwarves off-guard. The dwarves of Kanaglym proved a tougher enemy than the drow had anticipated, though. Not only did the dwarves force the drow back through the portal, but a force of dwarves followed and slaughtered the drow, claiming Zanhoriloch for their own. The dwarves who settled in Zanhoriloch set out after a year to visit Kanaglym and establish a safe route between the two cities, but found their old home empty and abandoned.~
@61821 = ~The Fugue Plane~
@61822 = ~When mortals die in Faerûn, their souls travel first to a bleak, gray place called the Fugue Plane. A pocket of the Astral Plane, the Fugue Plane exerts an irresistible pull to mortal souls. Though spirits have been known to lose their way to the Fugue, and though some are intercepted by necromancers or creatures that prey on souls, the majority of souls immediately travel to the Fugue upon their body's death. In the center of the Fugue Plane stands the City of Judgment, where the gathered souls will eventually travel to learn their final fate.~
@61823 = ~The Nine Hells~
@61824 = ~The source of law and evil in the multiverse, the Nine Hells are home to the evil devils known to scholars as baatezu. Each of the nine layers of this foul plane is ruled by a powerful devil who holds absolute sway over the denizens of their realm. Mortals who practice depraved acts of evil in life, or who foolishly barter away their souls, find themselves sent to the Nine Hells for eternal torment upon death. Souls awaiting judgment in the Fugue Plane may be tempted by baatezu, who offer to make the waiting souls agents of the Nine Hells. Some souls accept this evil bargain rather than take their chances with an unknown fate.~
@61825 = ~Commander's Chain Mail +3~
@61826 = ~Though the dents and dull spots of this chain mail show its use, someone has taken good care of the armor. Patches of bright new links show where the armor has been carefully mended. The lack of ornamentation or gilded patterns on the suit give it an honest look, as if this were the armor of a soldier who served well and honorably.

@61827 = ~The Nine Hells: Avernus~
@61828 = ~The first layer, or circle, of the Nine Hells is Avernus, a hellscape of choking smoke, exploding fireballs, blackened earth, and lava pools. Astral travelers who enter the Nine Hells always appear in Avernus, which is why this layer is sometimes referred to as the "topmost" level of Hell. The pit fiend Bel rules this layer from his fortress, the Bronze Citadel, where he trains legions of devil soldiers to fight in the Blood War.~
@61829 = ~The Nine Hells: Dis~
@61830 = ~The second circle of Hell, Dis, shares its name with the enormous iron city in the center of the plane. Dispater, the ruler of Dis, is known to be faultlessly obedient to the terms of contracts, but always writes his complex bargains to be in his favor. Beyond the city of Dis, flat plains crossed by foul, still rivers stretch endlessly.~
@61831 = ~The Nine Hells: Minauros~
@61832 = ~The archduke Mammon constructed the third level of Hell, a festering morass known as Minauros. Minauros is an endless plain of decaying bogs filled with rotting bodies and decomposing plant matter. The polluted air is impossible to breathe and oily rain constantly falls on the plain. Occasionally acidic blizzards or hailstones as big as boulders pound down on the surface of this fetid plane as well.~
@61833 = ~The Journal of Kelef Rhon, Knight of the Everwatch, serving guardian of Bridgefort, per the command of Guardian Harkin~
@61834 = ~The number of travelers crossing Boareskyr concerns me. The usual stream of traders threatens to become a flood of refugees from this "crusade." The refugees talk of this Caelar as though she's a basilisk—those that see her are rarely seen again, and those who are seen again are found serving under her banner.
__________

A half-elf girl Shello Khal hired to help with the cooking nearly burnt the fort down. I asked the girl how one burns down a stone fort, and she answered, "By accident." Frair Tajik asked her how many accidents she's had in her time. She said a couple, then allowed that it might be a few more than that.
__________

The girl, Neera, is obviously a wild mage. I'd throw her in the moat, but Shello isn't having any of it. He wants to be compensated for his losses. I've put the girl in a cell, warded by Wynan Hess, for the time being. That will cost someone a fine copper, I'm sure, and I'm just as sure I'll be the one they complain to when it does.
__________

A contingent of four score warriors under the Flaming Fist's banner is spending the night here before continuing across Boareskyr Bridge to Dragonspear Castle. "The Shining Lady" has pushed her luck too far. The Council of Four and the Lords of Waterdeep want to see an end to this chaos.
__________

A half-elf couple, Khalid and Jaheira, arrived shortly before the Fist. They claim they're here for some rest and relaxation—they chose the wrong place for that, or at least the wrong time to look for it! Though I suppose tensions have been eased with the wild mage behind bars.
__________

The day dawned, and with it came the realization that Caelar's crusade has grown beyond anything I imagined. Troops under her banner, led by the Barghest—the Barghest, by Tyr's right hand!—marched across Boareskyr and took up position round the fort. Those camped on our side sought refuge within our walls. Looking at the enemy's armament, I don't know how much refuge there is to be had here anymore.
__________

Khalid is beside himself. His wife was in the forest, doing some druid thing I imagine, when the crusade arrived. Being parted from Jaheira does not suit him, not at all. He stutters at the best of times—now he's all but incomprehensible. An alchemist new to our walls, Elandro, brewed a concoction that calmed him somewhat. If things continue going the direction they have been, I'll need every sword I can get.
__________

This is madness! The crusade has offered us the opportunity to walk away from this alive if we surrender the fort. Those who have actually made this place their home seem willing to accept the terms. But those refugees who've taken shelter here the past weeks refuse to listen to reason. They've lost their lands to Caelar Argent's mercenaries and their families to her charm. They refuse to lose anything else. They are determined to stand against the Barghest come what may. I am bound by honor and by Helm's will to protect them, and so I must.
__________

For a moment, all seemed lost. With Wynan Hess distracted by a mystic assault on the Fort's gate, the crusaders breached the eastern wall and surged over the moat. In desperation, Khalid let Neera out of her cell. She may not be able to control her magic, but fire burns the crusaders as well as anyone else. The crusaders pulled back. With Neera's help, Wynan has further strengthened his magical shields, though the effort cost him greatly.

One night at camp Kitsana's party each took a turn trying to master the unusually thin bowstring and uniquely curved grip of the weapon. None shot as poorly as the fighter, a braggart named Tirrel, who not only missed his target by a foot but who snapped the bowstring down the length of his forearm and tore off a strip of skin. Kitsana and her party faded into obscurity decades ago but her bow still circulates.

The dwarves burrowed down into the rock, freeing the waters beneath, but discovered their new well contained strange properties. The waters glowed with a violet light, originally thought to be the faerzress which suffuses the Underdark with its energy. But after dwarves began forgetting their names and families, the shamans investigated further. They found a swirling portal to the Fugue Plane churning at the bottom of the shaft. They named the well the Fountain of Nepenthe and began casting about for a new location in which to dig. Records at this time grow spotty, but it is known that not long after the dwarves abandoned their town.~

I should look for the icon fragments in the rubble to the north, or talk to Morale Officer Deneld.

Though Caelar has a hold of her followers' hearts, some need some extra reassurance. Two recruits, Kjarvan and Qing, are desperately praying to an old icon of Tempus that is missing two pieces. The fragments may be in the rubble to the north, or Morale Officer Deneld might have seen them.~
@61874 = ~Foehammer's Blessing

I need to find a priest of Tempus to bless these shards.

I've recovered the two missing shards from the broken icon of Tempus. Ideally a priest of the Lord of Battles would bless the pieces. There are no priests of Tempus in the crusader camp, so far as I can tell. Perhaps I can find one among my allies.~
@61875 = ~Foehammer's Blessing

Once I have both icon pieces I can return to recruits Kjarvan and Qing in the northwest corner of the courtyard.

I recovered one of the broken icon's missing pieces.~

Mizhena, a priest of Tempus, agreed to bless the fragments of the icon for me. I will return to Kjarvan and Qing and let them know.~
@61877 = ~Foehammer's Blessing

I've restored the icon of Tempus.

I restored Tempus's icon and was challenged by the god. I declined the challenge. Anything the Lord of Battles considers challenging is better off avoided.~

I've restored the icon of Tempus.

I restored Tempus's icon and was challenged by the god. I accepted the challenge and was victorious in the battle that ensued.~

@61884 = ~Murs and the Brigands

I can either fight the two ogres on my own, or I can fight them as Murs's champion.

The crusaders drove a band of ogre brigands from the underground caverns and captured the band's leader, Slug. His "widow," Murs, is trying to take control of the band. I can challenge for leadership fighting two ogre contenders alone, or I can fight them as Murs's champion.~
@61885 = ~Murs and the Brigands

I've become the leader of the ogre tribe.

I successfully challenged the ogres hoping to lead the tribe. Now I have my very own group of ogre brigands. ~
@61886 = ~Murs and the Brigands

Murs has become the leader of the ogre tribe.

I successfully challenged Murs's challengers as chief of the tribe. Now she leads the ogres and seems willing to help me.~

@61900 = ~The Wychlaran and the Berserker

I should watch for evidence of the crusade's corruption when I enter the underground caverns.

I must find evidence of the crusade's corruption that will convince Julann of Rashemen not to join Caelar. If I fail, the Shining Lady will gain some powerful allies.~
@61904 = ~The Wychlaran and the Berserker

Rigah seems bolstered by my speech.

Rigah has spent many years away from his home, guarding his very unusual witch. I told him that without his help, Julann would be lost in her wanderings. Reminding him of his obligation to protect her calmed him somewhat.~
@61905 = ~The Wychlaran and the Berserker

Our talk seems to have depressed Rigah.

Rigah has spent many years away from his home in Rashemen, guarding the witch Julann. I told him her flightiness and irresponsibility would extend his dajemma forever. I think he saw the truth in my words.~
@61906 = ~The Wychlaran and the Berserker

I've concluded my dealings with Rigah and Julann.

I brought Julann proof of Hephernaan's corruption. Rigah helped convince her the crusade was not worthy of her support. As thanks for helping Julann, Rigah gave me his sword.~
@61907 = ~The Wychlaran and the Berserker

I've concluded my dealings with Rigah and Julann.

I brought Julann proof of Hephernaan's corruption but still she wasn't convinced. Rigah recognized his witch's corruption was complete and helped me slay her.~
@61908 = ~The Wychlaran and the Berserker

I've concluded my dealings with Rigah and Julann.

I brought Julann proof of Hephernaan's corruption, but she refused to accept the truth. I slew her and her bodyguard.~
@61909 = ~The Wychlaran and the Berserker

I've concluded my dealings with Rigah and Julann.

I brought Julann proof of Hephernaan's corruption, but she is willfully blind to the mage's villainy. She and her bodyguard, Rigah, left the area, headed in the direction of Dragonspear Castle.~

Now I'm supposed to move the grain back to where I found it.

Ladle, a gnome at the crusader depot, now wants me to move the grain back to its original location.~
@61913 = ~Moving Crates

I've finished moving all of Ladle's crates.

Moving the crates was Ladle's way of giving me busywork. He admitted such labor keeps crusaders from getting antsy and fighting amongst themselves. It is sound management technique, I suppose, but a complete waste of my time.~

I found the missing drow teenagers, only to see them slain by an ankheg. I suppose I should inform Shapur of their deaths.~

I should bring these badges to Shapur.

I found the drow teenagers—star-crossed lovers who begged me not to return them to their families. I agreed to pretend they were dead. They gave me their house insignias to show Shapur.~
@61921 = ~Drow Runaways

I should return to Shapur for my reward.

I found the drow teenagers and convinced them to return home. They will meet me where their drow kinsfolk face off against the crusaders.~

The drow adolescents have escaped.

I found the drow teenagers and told them Shapur was dead. They were delighted and headed for the surface.~

I informed Shapur of the drow teens' deaths. She was not pleased and a battle ensued.~

The drow returned to Shapur. Rather begrudgingly, Shapur thanked me before withdrawing her search party from the area.~

A motley collection of ghosts are trapped between worlds, lost in the caverns beneath Dragonspear. If I find a way to the Fugue Plane, I should bring their remains there to lay their spirits to rest.~
@61930 = ~The Lost

I came across an ettin ghost who I believe lingers in the Prime Material Plane searching for a missing club. If I find it, he might be able to move on.~

Now that the ettin's ghost is at rest, I need to find the Fugue Plane where I can put these other remains.

I encountered the shade of an enormous dragon, Halatathlaer, guarding a pair of doors. The dragon offered vague threats of death should I attempt to pass it, but its wording makes me believe some other force compels it. I believe I can pass safely by the ghost dragon; after that, I should try to find whoever holds its "essence" and free Halatathlaer from servitude.~
@61934 = ~Ghost Dragon Guardian

@61938 = ~Ghost Dragon Guardian 

The ghost dragon is gone.

The dragon ghost Halatathlaer has told me all it knows of the dark magicians who bound it in service. It appears Caelar's adviser Hephernaan is not what he seems. The dragon's spirit has now departed, transported to the Fugue Plane via the Fountain of Nepenthe.~
@61939 = ~Ghost Dragon Guardian

The ghost dragon is gone.

The dragon ghost Halatathlaer has told me what little it knows of Caelar. The Shining Lady does the bidding of another, though perhaps not knowingly. The dragon's spirit has now departed, transported to the Fugue Plane via the Fountain of Nepenthe.~

The dragon ghost Halatathlaer has departed, its spirit transported to the Fugue Plane via the Fountain of Nepenthe. Before it left, it bid me tell its old friend, Daeros, where it can be found. Assuming it meant Daeros Dragonspear, I think it unlikely we shall cross paths, as the lord of Dragonspear Castle died decades ago.~
@61942 = ~Find Daeros

I should watch for the presence of Daeros Dragonspear, though he must be long dead.

The dragon ghost Halatathlaer has departed this world. Before it left, it asked that, should I encounter its old friend, Daeros, I inform him that Halatathlaer awaits him in the Fugue Plane.~

This particular weapon has been enhanced magically to complement the skill of the wielder.

Later that evening, the witches were exhausted after a hard day of slaying innocents and desecrating the palace, so they called for the court bard to play them a song. Methild the bard was loyal to his king and the king's family and so he used the special powers of his magic harp.

As he played, he focused his attention first on the king. As the song played on, the spell of holding upon the king dissipated, and the noble liege slowly crept away. One by one Methild freed his patrons, being careful to keep the witches' attention drawn his way. Finally, once all the family was free, the bard could play no longer and the witches saw his treachery. Poor Methild, unlike his lieges, did not escape and was served on the supper table in their place.

Ophyllis died an agonized, painful death, but not before he gave the sword to a <PRO_MANWOMAN> to whom he owed a deep personal debt. His mournful voice can still be heard by those who wield the blade.

"Dear <CHARNAME>, 

It took longer to collect the proper amount of gold than it should have, and far too long to return it to you. I cannot tell you how sincerely grateful I am for your patience in this matter. Here you should find all the monies owed you, plus an additional 17 gold pieces. I realize this small token in no way makes up for my my failure, but to try and find more would have been to delay repaying you even longer than I have already. I hope this finds you in good spirits and health. Thank you once again.

@62672 = ~Look at all these refugees hangin' about. Put 'em to work, I say. Have 'em clear the beasties out of the sewers. ~
@62673 = ~No time to talk. Many errands to run today.~
@62674 = ~Too much rain this year, not enough rain last year. Gods must be annoyed with us again.~
@62675 = ~Do you own a boat? You look like you'd make a good captain.~
@62676 = ~Been saving my gold for a special treat. Heading to the Three Old Kegs tonight for a tankard of mead. ~
@62677 = ~Have a good day, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Someone ought to.~
@62678 = ~Two friends of mine up north have joined this crusade. I can see why. Nothing else for them since the farm failed.~
@62679 = ~The city's fit to burst with all these refugees. Took me three hours to get from the harbor to the temple this morning.~
@62680 = ~My joints are acting up. Storm's a-comin', mark me on that.~
@62681 = ~A chicken farmer came into the city this morning to sell some eggs. I love fresh eggs. You look like someone that could use a few good eggs.~
@62682 = ~Hey! Watch where you're going. Bloody heroes, think we should worship the ground they walk on...~
@62683 = ~So many have lost their homes and loved ones. I feel bad for all the refugees. Wouldn't give 'em a single copper, but still.~
@62684 = ~You're the one they say has Bhaal's blood in <PRO_HISHER> veins, aren't you? Yeah. You move along now.~
@62685 = ~They've stuffed hundreds of those refugees in the Iron Throne building. I might put on some rags and hang around the building, see if I get a free dinner.~
@62686 = ~Were you talking to me? I've got nothing to say to you.~
@62687 = ~Have we been introduced? I feel I would remember someone of your, er... mien. ~
@62688 = ~One simply CAN'T walk on the streets nowadays. A carriage is the only way to travel, but the Fist wants them off the streets for the duration of this crisis. Ridiculous!~
@62689 = ~What sort of life does Caelar Argent give her followers? Scrabbling around in the mud with orcs and other ne'er-do-wells... eugh!~
@62690 = ~Getting people to notice your good deeds can be challenging.~
@62691 = ~It turns out Amnian diamond-water causes a terrible rash. I shall never take a traveling apothecary at his word again!~
@62692 = ~Is THAT what people are wearing these days? Oh dear.~
@62693 = ~The Grand Dukes are going to receive a sternly worded letter about this.~
@62694 = ~In my day, one didn't speak to one's betters without permission. ~
@62695 = ~The latest fashions in Waterdeep are simply too—too much.~
@62696 = ~Away with you, beggar.~
@62697 = ~Do I look like I have time for idle conversation? Begone!~
@62698 = ~I'm expected to help support these refugees? I lose enough in taxes. ~
@62699 = ~The Council must end this ridiculous "crusade." It's straining our fair city's resources to the limit.~
@62700 = ~I couldn't decide whether to wear my sapphires or my rubies this morning. Life truly is a trial some days.~
@62701 = ~Excuse me, I'm late for an important meeting.~
@62702 = ~Well... How did I get here?~
@62703 = ~I can't believe it. You're really the hero of Baldur's Gate!~
@62704 = ~Sarevok never stood a chance against someone like you! ~
@62705 = ~We're all safer for having you in our city.~
@62706 = ~Will you kiss my baby? He's at home, but if you stay here I'll go get him.~
@62707 = ~From the moment I saw you, I knew you were a real hero.~
@62708 = ~It's good to know there are still people like you in the world.~
@62709 = ~You'll deal with that Caelar creature in no time! "Shining Lady" my backside!~
@62710 = ~When my child grows up, I hope <PRO_HESHE> is just like you.~
@62711 = ~I know what you did for Nashkel. You have my thanks.~
@62712 = ~You're not as tall as I thought you'd be. Bit wider, though.~
@62713 = ~Your name will go down in history. You are a great <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@62714 = ~Are you single? Hah! I knew it.~
@62715 = ~We could use a few more people like you around here.~
@62716 = ~You saved our city! Three cheers for the hero of the Gate!~
@62717 = ~The city still stands thanks to you, and doing better than ever.~
@62718 = ~I've heard what they say about you. How are we trust someone with Bhaal's blood in their veins?~
@62719 = ~I've nothing to say to the likes of you.~
@62720 = ~You're not fooling anyone. We're watching you.~
@62721 = ~Sarevok lives and you're his stooge! I have proof!~
@62722 = ~Blood will tell. You can't fight your nature. The rumors about you are all true, I say!~
@62723 = ~The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. If the whispers are true, your apple falls from a twisted tree indeed.~
@62724 = ~Sarevok's journal claims you're as his kin! What do you say to that, child of murder?~
@62725 = ~Why should we believe anything you say?~
@62726 = ~Silvershield's a fool, putting his trust in you. He clutches a viper to his breast.~
@62727 = ~If I were in the Flaming Fist, I'd be more worried about you than some crusade.~
@62728 = ~A dark god's stench is upon you! The rumors are true!~
@62729 = ~Stop staring at my child. Don't look at her—get away!~
@62730 = ~You're taller than I thought you'd be.~
@62731 = ~You're a twisted sort, aren't you? I can tell just by looking at you.~
@62732 = ~Get out of our city! Baldur's Gate doesn't need another Sarevok!~
@62733 = ~How long do you think we'll be camped here? Caelar's on the move—we should be too.~
@62734 = ~The next trick is to reach Coast Way Crossing before the crusade.~
@62735 = ~We'll take care of things here while you scout ahead.~
@62736 = ~My blisters have blisters. Want to see them? Here, look at them. Look at my blisters.~
@62737 = ~I hope the crusaders like the taste of flaming knuckles. They're about to get a face full of them.~
@62738 = ~There's a column of black smoke rising from the northeast? Wonder what's going on there.~
@62739 = ~Sorry, can't talk. Duty calls behind yonder tree.~
@62740 = ~I thought I'd have a drink at Coast Way Inn tonight, but it's burned down. Gods! Why is my life so difficult?~
@62741 = ~They say an army marches on its stomach, but I march on these new boots my mum bought me.~
@62742 = ~We've got a lot of good people out here. Waterdeep and Daggerford's people better be equal to ours—I don't want to carry our "friends."~
@62743 = ~I can't wait to meet this so-called crusade. We're going to give them an unholy hiding.~
@62744 = ~Well met. I'm glad to have the hero of Baldur's Gate on our side.~
@62745 = ~I can't be seen talking with you. No offense, but we've all heard the rumors and I've got to work with these people.~
@62746 = ~Cover the supplies with tarps in case it rains. The weather out here is unpredictable.~
@62747 = ~If the crusade thinks they can hold the trade way, they'd best think again.~
@62748 = ~Don't give any items to the prisoners. No physical contact.~
@62749 = ~Half of these scum are refugees from up north. No money and no manners. They deserve to be locked up.~
@62750 = ~Stay on the straight and narrow if you don't want to wind up here.~
@62751 = ~Good day, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@62752 = ~Finish your business and be off. This isn't a zoo.~
@62753 = ~Half the Fist is spread between here and the Cloudpeak Mountains trying to restore order after the iron crisis. We're woefully understaffed.~
@62754 = ~That Tiax fellow is mad. Completely off his rocker. I can't stand him, but some in here have started treating him as a mascot.~
@62755 = ~A pleasure to meet you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@62756 = ~I've heard a lot about you. It wasn't all good. I've got my eyes on you.~
@62757 = ~The cell locks are unpickable. Designed and constructed by Halbazzer himself. ~
@62758 = ~Let me know if there's anything I can help you with, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@62759 = ~We'll run out of room in the cells if the refugees keep pouring into the city. They're desperate, and desperate people do desperate things.~
@62760 = ~We've made more arrests this month than any other month, but what do we get for it? Nothing, that's what.~
@62761 = ~I feel bad for a few of these prisoners. Very few. Most of them are where they ought to be.~
@62762 = ~I recognize you! You killed Sarevok. Nice work, that.~
@62763 = ~I'm innocent I tell you. Innocent! Just ask me fence!~
@62764 = ~It wasn't me, it was the one-legged man!~
@62765 = ~Yeah, I did it. You'd've done the same.~
@62766 = ~Is it day or night? So long since I've seen the sun...~
@62767 = ~The food here is awful, but it's better than I usually get. I get thrown in here often as I can.~
@62768 = ~You can't keep me locked up forever!~
@62769 = ~Step closer. Closer still. Just a little closer...~
@62770 = ~I did the crime, now I'll serve the time. But he shouldn'ta mouthed off like that.~
@62771 = ~Get me out of this hells-hole!~
@62772 = ~What do you want? I'm a bit tied up at the moment.~
@62773 = ~Don't stare at me.~
@62774 = ~When I get out of here, I'm going to give up this life of crime and become a bard. ~
@62775 = ~I offered the judge a bribe and he gave me MORE time in the clink. What's the world coming to, I ask you?~
@62776 = ~Leave me alone.~
@62777 = ~I've heard the rumors, kin of Sarevok. Get outta here, I got nothing to say to you.~
@62778 = ~Keep back! No shoving!~
@62779 = ~The Council's heard your pleas. Now clear out!~
@62780 = ~Where did all these people come from? The crusade must be moving faster than we thought.~
@62781 = ~If the crowd doesn't settle down, we'll have to start making arrests.~
@62782 = ~They may be refugees, but that doesn't give them leave to disrupt others' lives.~
@62783 = ~The Iron Throne building's been set up as temporary housing, but we're running out of places to put the refugees.~
@62784 = ~I hear six different bards are collaborating on a song to raise money for the refugees.~
@62785 = ~Step back now!~
@62786 = ~Calm down. The dukes are working on resolving the situation. They just need time, so give them some, gods damn it!~
@62787 = ~The crowd just keeps growing, like flies on a corpse.~
@62788 = ~You can hardly move through the streets, they're so packed.~
@62789 = ~The dukes can't leave the palace without getting mobbed.~
@62790 = ~You shouldn't see crowds this size outside of festival days.~
@62791 = ~Who'll help us start new lives?~
@62792 = ~I lost everything when crusade mercenaries took my village. They took what they wanted and burned the rest.~
@62793 = ~I barely escaped the crusade with my life.~
@62794 = ~The Council of Four is supposed to protect us. Where is our protection? Where?~
@62795 = ~Shall we take what we need, as the crusade did? The Council's not leaving us much choice!~
@62796 = ~I've nothing to live for. The dukes need to step up and show us there's still hope in the world.~
@62797 = ~The Fist can't keep us from the Council forever! We will be heard!~
@62798 = ~Do the dukes even know we're out here?~
@62799 = ~Why do the dukes get to live in the palace while we're sleeping on cobblestones, huh? Answer me that!~
@62800 = ~Why isn't the Flaming Fist marching on the crusade right now? Those fanatics need to be stopped!~
@62801 = ~I don't understand what the crusade wants. They said their grand plan would be revealed. I don't care what they're up to—ran the first chance I got.~
@62802 = ~Someone needs to listen to us! Someone needs to help!~
@62803 = ~It was a long march to Baldur's Gate. Now we're here and no one wants to help us. The Iron Throne's filled to bursting; we have nowhere to go.~
@62804 = ~I have no relatives who can take me in. Where am I supposed to sleep tonight?~
@62805 = ~Someone needs to stop the crusade!~
@62806 = ~Where are we supposed to sleep?~
@62807 = ~The dukes are doing nothing to protect us!~
@62808 = ~The Fist needs to march on the crusade!~
@62809 = ~Stop hiding inside your fancy palace!~
@62810 = ~You can't hide forever, dukes!~
@62811 = ~Those fanatics need to be stopped! The crusade does more damage every day!~
@62812 = ~I've been waiting for over an hour!~
@62813 = ~I heard this is the best shop in Baldur's Gate. Since the crusade drove me to the city, I thought I'd check it out.~
@62814 = ~I managed to hold onto most of my gold on the road. I've earned this spending spree.~
@62815 = ~If I think about my situation, I'll cry. Time to go shopping.~
@62816 = ~What's taking so long? People need to make up their minds.~
@62817 = ~I hope they haven't run out of potions of stone giant strength. Potions of storm giant strength won't do. That's TOO much strength.~
@62818 = ~I wish my friend was here. The crusade "recruited" him.~
@62819 = ~Come on, keep the line moving! No cutting in!~
@62820 = ~I'm holding this place for someone.~
@62821 = ~You're da hero of Baldur's Gate? Yeah, well, ya still can't cut in line.~
@62822 = ~I hope they have some robes in my size left.~
@62823 = ~I need a wand of sleep. I get terrible insomnia.~
@62824 = ~My legs are going to give out if I have to stand much longer.~
@62825 = ~Halbazzer should hire a bard to sing for us while we wait. Or at least some courtesans.~
@62826 = ~To cook a fantastic meal, you need absolute silence. ABSOLUTE silence. You see where I'm going with this?~
@62827 = ~I don't allow others to assist me. I wouldn't let my own mother try to dice this celery. The celery's the most important part.~
@62828 = ~Sometimes, I get special meal requests. I ignore them. Say "yes" to one and soon people will want no mushrooms in their mushroom soup.~
@62829 = ~I rely on my refined palate to create complex flavor profiles.~
@62830 = ~No one appreciates how hard it is to do what I do. I am an artist, a slave to my craft.~
@62831 = ~ONE MORE complaint about the food and I pack up my knives and go.~
@62832 = ~Some day I'd like to open up my own restaurant. Imported ingredients, lots of big flavors, and even bigger prices!~
@62833 = ~I hired an assistant once, but he only lasted a few weeks. Had to chop him after he burned a roast.~
@62834 = ~I use shallots instead of onions wherever possible. Who wouldn't, right?~
@62835 = ~The worst thing about being a chef is the long hours. The best part? I'd have to go with the hat.~
@62836 = ~I'm glad I'm not with that army up north. Camp cooking is the worst.~
@62837 = ~Just don't touch anything, please. I have my kitchen organized exactly how I like.~
@62838 = ~Fancy a bit of company for the evening?~
@62839 = ~Sorry, love, I'm all booked up.~
@62840 = ~I like to see the gold up front, just so's you know.~
@62841 = ~The curve is more powerful than the sword.~
@62842 = ~I may be a courtesan, but I deserve to be treated well.~
@62843 = ~I set the price and the place. You don't like that, you can be on your way.~
@62844 = ~Anything worth doing is worth doing slowly.~
@62845 = ~Like what you see, darlin'? You've got expensive tastes.~
@62846 = ~It's tough right now, with all these refugees in town. Most have no money, and only one thing to sell.~
@62847 = ~If an army marches on that crusade, they're going to need some company to go along and boost morale, don't you think?~
@62848 = ~You're funny looking.~
@62849 = ~I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, but you look real interesting.~
@62850 = ~They say you're a hero. Can I be a hero too?~
@62851 = ~When I grow up, I'm going to own a candy store!~
@62852 = ~I wish every day was my birthday.~
@62853 = ~The city's so crowded now. And it smells like feet.~
@62854 = ~Do you have a sword? I'm not allowed to play with swords.~
@62855 = ~Momma says I can't go out alone anymore because there are so many people about.~
@62856 = ~I saw a dragon once. Daddy said I was just dreaming, but I know what I saw.~
@62857 = ~If you want to get bigger and stronger, you should try eating vegetables.~
@62858 = ~If you could choose, would you rather ride a unicorn or a griffon? I'd pick the griffon. They can fly.~
@62859 = ~My mommy says those sad-looking people lost their homes. The kids too. I wish I could give them my home. They can't have my toys, though.~
@62860 = ~I wish I could have a pet rat. Daddy says they're too dirty, but I'd bathe mine every day!~
@62861 = ~Let's play knights and dragons! I'll be the knight, you be the dragon.~
@62862 = ~I'm hungry.~
@62863 = ~We had to walk for so long. Mommy carried me sometimes, but I walked as much as I could.~
@62864 = ~This is going to be our new home. I want my old home back.~
@62865 = ~I wish we could go back to our old house. My stuffed tarrasque there.~
@62866 = ~There's too many people here. I hate the noise.~
@62867 = ~Daddy says not to worry, we'll have something to eat tonight.~
@62868 = ~You can't see the stars at night here like you can at the farm.~
@62869 = ~I like having other kids to play with!~
@62870 = ~I hope I see my friends again someday.~
@62871 = ~When I sleep, sometimes I dream my house is burning down again.~
@62872 = ~At night when we camped, I could hear wolves howling and all sorts of scary noises. I didn't like that part.~
@62873 = ~Are we safe now? Forever?~
@62874 = ~I don't understand why we had to leave our home. Mommy said mean people made us do it.~
@62875 = ~My feet hurt.~
@62876 = ~I just want to sleep in a bed tonight.~
@62877 = ~We can't be on the street all night. Does the Council expect us to sleep on cobblestones?~
@62878 = ~At least a monk came out a few hours ago and gave us some bread.~
@62879 = ~My legs are so tired they feel ready to fall off.~
@62880 = ~The crusade has robbed us of our homes and stolen some of our families away. Now we don't even have a place to lay down our heads.~
@62881 = ~Let us in! The people inside have rested enough, it's our turn!~
@62882 = ~If this place has no room for us, maybe we'll find one of those big fancy houses to sleep in. Whether the owners like it or not.~
@62883 = ~Can't someone talk to the people inside and get them to let us in?~
@62884 = ~I suppose we should be grateful it's not Deepwinter. Still, they could pass some blankets around.~
@62885 = ~"You'll find refuge in Baldur's Gate." Load o' horse nuggets, that was.~
@62886 = ~What I'd give to spend a night in my own house. Caelar's mercenaries burned it to the ground.~
@62887 = ~Let us inside! This is no way to treat people!~
@62888 = ~Hey you! Yeah, you, hero of Baldur's Gate. You see what the crusade did to us? What're you gonna do about it?~
@62889 = ~It's so noisy in here. I'd like a little peace and quiet.~
@62890 = ~It's a roof over our heads and we're grateful, but it's still not home.~
@62891 = ~I can scarce believe we made it after all that walking.~
@62892 = ~I wore a hole right through my boot getting here.~
@62893 = ~I left my whole life behind when I came to Baldur's Gate. No, that's not right. The crusade TOOK my whole life away.~
@62894 = ~Are you the hero of Baldur's Gate? Are you going to stop this horrible crusade?~
@62895 = ~This bedroll is all I have to call my own now.~
@62896 = ~At least the monks take care of us.~
@62897 = ~Why do the gods try us like this? Why?~
@62898 = ~Whenever I close my eyes, I see the crusade destroying our town. That image that will haunt me for all my days.~
@62899 = ~My feet are soaked. Fetch me a rag, will you?~
@62900 = ~They'd best get some washbasins in here or it's going to get real smelly.~
@62901 = ~I can't believe my life has come to this.~
@62902 = ~The crusade's dug in deeper than we thought. They've seized Boareskyr Bridge and are laying siege to Bridgefort.~
@62903 = ~When are we going to see some action? We should move against the crusaders besieging Bridgefort!~
@62904 = ~Bridgefort seems to be holding the crusaders off, but that can't last forever.~
@62905 = ~We have to break this siege. We need to cross Boareskyr Bridge if we're to march west and join our allies.~
@62906 = ~Rat stew for dinner AGAIN?~
@62907 = ~I broke my lucky bowstring. That's it for me, then. I'm doomed.~
@62908 = ~Have you made any progress with the Bridgefort siege? We're ready to help however we can.~
@62909 = ~With you on our side, we're sure to win the day.~
@62910 = ~They say Boareskyr Bridge is where Cyric slew the Lord of Murder. The water downstream's been poisoned ever since.~
@62911 = ~That crusader camp makes me nervous. What are they plotting?~
@62912 = ~We've some of the Sword Coast's finest soldiers with us. Give us the word, we'll smash through the crusade's defenses!~
@62913 = ~Since the iron crisis I always carry a backup sword, just in case the first one breaks. ~
@62914 = ~I hear the man leading the crusaders round Bridgefort is near legendary for his deeds in the last Dragonspear War.~
@62915 = ~A pleasant day to you, and a cursed one to the crusade!~
@62916 = ~I've got enough to do without wasting my time talking to you.~
@62917 = ~Caelar will lead us to victory! Those who were lost will be reclaimed!~
@62918 = ~We are on the right side of history, <PRO_RACE>. Our enemies just don't undestand what it is we seek to do.~
@62919 = ~My feet hurt. I'm not used to marching so much, but it will all be worth it if I can rescue my beloved.~
@62920 = ~I used to be a sewer cleaner. This is better.~
@62921 = ~Have you seen Caelar yet? They say she shines like the sun.~
@62922 = ~The divine protection granted Caelar and her acolytes will allow us to triumph. Never forget, the gods stand beside us.~
@62923 = ~Some of the crusade's commanders have... troubling pasts. But I trust the Shining Lady's judgment. She knows what is best.~
@62924 = ~We will take this fort or die trying! All who defy our righteous crusade must be punished!~
@62925 = ~I miss my family, but I'm out here doing good work. They understand.~
@62926 = ~You look familiar. Have we met?~
@62927 = ~Good day, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@62928 = ~Whatever Caelar needs, we will do. ~
@62929 = ~Forgive me, I cannot speak to you now. I've much to do.~
@62930 = ~You look lost. If you need something to do, talk to one of the commanders.~
@62931 = ~Our crusade will be remembered for centuries to come. This will be the turning point in a great war against evil!~
@62932 = ~As long as I get paid, I'll fight anyone you point me at.~
@62933 = ~Just pass the orders down and I carry 'em out.~
@62934 = ~Everyone here seems hypnotized by this Caelar. ~
@62935 = ~Sure I like the crusade. They pay up front.~

@62941 = ~Any new face is a pleasant one around here. Greetings to you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@62942 = ~Be honest, what do you think our chances are? Good? Terrible? I'd say middling. ~
@62943 = ~You have nothing to fear with me on watch. The crusade will get our supplies over my dead body!~
@62944 = ~The refugees are frightened by the crusade. I'm more worried about the soldiers who share their feelings. ~
@62945 = ~Our supplies are holding out. By the time the crusade seizes Bridgefort, we'll have eaten through everything they wanted to take from us.~
@62946 = ~This fort wasn't built to last, but the moat has been successful in holding the enemy at bay.~
@62947 = ~No movement from the crusader camp yet, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I'd like to see them try and get across that moat!~
@62948 = ~I'm happy to follow Khalid. He's a strong warrior.~
@62949 = ~I killed a crusader trying to come over the wall yesterday! Actually, it was a squirrel. But I THOUGHT it was a crusader, and they say it's the thought that counts.~
@62950 = ~Fine weather for a siege. Be finer weather if a tornado ripped through the crusader camp.~
@62951 = ~I have to pay attention to my task. Excuse me.~
@62952 = ~We're doing a lot better now that the keep isn't on fire. Bloody mages.~
@62953 = ~There are many of us who believe you're here to help. I'm not so sure. I was present in Baldur's Gate not long ago, and I've heard unsettling rumors about you.~
@62954 = ~Yes? Is there something you'd like? You're just kind of... staring at me.~
@62955 = ~Greetings, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@62956 = ~The crusaders can't take the fort, can they? When I lost the farm, I thought I would be safe behind these walls. But now...~
@62957 = ~Arrows rain down on the daily, and spies are constantly creeping upon the walls. It's enough to drive me mad!~
@62958 = ~Would that I could lift a sword... I would defend this place to my dying breath!~
@62959 = ~Cheer up. The <DAYNIGHTALL> can only get better from here.~
@62960 = ~It's good to get some fresh air from time to time, though I worry about the stray arrows fired by the crusaders.~
@62961 = ~You might as well admit it, we're all doomed. We were doomed the minute the crusaders set forth from the ruins of Dragonspear.~
@62962 = ~I heard that the crusaders are protected by one, or perhaps all of the gods. The rumors say that none of their soldiers can be truly killed, for they will simply rise again.~
@62963 = ~Pardon me, I have no wish to bother you. ~
@62964 = ~There's something about a woman in uniform that drives me wild.~
@62965 = ~I hoped I'd find safety here. A place to start a new home. Instead there's more danger... more death. ~
@62966 = ~The crusaders burned my house to the ground after they ransacked it. What god would allow this? How can they claim to be on the side of the divine?~
@62967 = ~I'd better see if I can make myself useful around here. I can haul a mean sack.~
@62968 = ~I don't know where I'll go from here. Assuming any of us survive. Soubar is to the east, but banditry plagues the roads these days.~
@62969 = ~How long can we endure this siege? Khalid claims that we have ample supplies, and that in fact this is why the crusaders wish to topple our fort. But his fearful stuttering does not inspire much confidence.~
@62970 = ~How's it going out there? Tensions seem to be running higher than normal.~
@62971 = ~It's almost time for my shift. Excuse me.~
@62972 = ~We're the last line of defense if the crusaders breach the walls. If we don't keep them out, we'll be drawn and quartered for sure.~
@62973 = ~Those crusaders better hope they don't meet the edge of my blade.~
@62974 = ~My own brother helps to lay siege to this place. I have tried to speak to him from afar, but his eyes... they look possessed. How could he turn on me like this? Our mother was slain in the last Dragonspear War, but... I refuse to believe he would go this far.~
@62975 = ~Greetings, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@62976 = ~If we don't stop the crusade here, there's no telling how far they'll go. Our supplies could fuel the crusade for weeks, or months. ~
@62977 = ~I know some say you can't be trusted, but I think you're here to help us. I refuse to believe the rumors.~
@62978 = ~I'd like to stay and talk to you, but my duties won't wait.~
@62979 = ~I know who you are and I'd rather not speak to you. ~
@62980 = ~I had a dream last night that Khalid was talking to me, but everything he said came out backwards. Do you think it's an omen? ~
@62981 = ~Outside you can see the sky, but death can rain down from above at any time. In here there are only shadows. I'm not sure which option is worse.~
@62982 = ~I serve the memory of those lost to the crusade.~
@62983 = ~Join a caravan, they said. See Faerûn, they said. I'd rather be sailing.~
@62984 = ~It's starting to smell like sweaty bedrolls in here.~
@62985 = ~Ughhh... my leg...~
@62986 = ~I tried scouting some of the crusaders' positions. Got a crossbow bolt in the shoulder for my trouble.~
@62987 = ~I want to fight, not laze about in a bunk all day.~
@62988 = ~Ooooh... Too much chokeberry.~
@62989 = ~I feel sick. Where's that bucket? No, the other bucket.~
@62990 = ~At least I'm still alive. Better than some.~
@62991 = ~The cleric says it'll be a miracle if I can walk without a cane again. Miracles is what clerics do, right?~
@62992 = ~I'm burning up. Water, please!~
@62993 = ~Greetings, hero. It's good of you to visit us.~
@62994 = ~Get out of my face.~
@62995 = ~Does the siege go on? I've been stuck on my back for days.~
@62996 = ~I used to be an adventurer like you. Then a horse kicked me in the head. Now I'm an adventurer like me. One with fewer teeth.~
@62997 = ~I need to get well so I can rejoin the fight!~
@62998 = ~If we're lucky, the siege will be over soon.~
@62999 = ~Mother? Is that you, Mother?~
@63000 = ~How fare the fort's defenders?~
@63001 = ~Excuse me. I promised to help Frair Tajik clean bandages.~
@63002 = ~Will this siege never end? I suppose it doesn't matter. All my belongings were outside the fort when the crusade descended upon us.~
@63003 = ~I'll help the defenders however I can.~
@63004 = ~Pleased to meet you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. How much longer will we be trapped here?~
@63005 = ~I know you. I came from Baldur's Gate. People there say you bring bad luck wherever you go.~
@63006 = ~You must have more important things to do than talk to me. I know I do.~
@63007 = ~I saw a dog running around earlier. I hope my dog's all right.~
@63008 = ~I don't see why the soldiers get the cots and WE have to sleep on the floor.~
@63009 = ~When I get outta here, the first thing I'm going to do is cook up a delicious rabbit.~
@63010 = ~There's something about a man in uniform that makes me nervous.~
@63011 = ~This is still better than life on the road. Of course, I sleep in ditches.~
@63012 = ~We need a bard here to spin a tale of the brave defenders of Bridgefort!~
@63013 = ~We are reasonably well stocked and well armed. But morale falters with every passing day.~
@63014 = ~If it weren't for this old discus-throwing injury of mine, I'd be out there defending the fort.~
@63015 = ~Take them down!~
@63016 = ~I'm wounded!~
@63017 = ~To me!~
@63018 = ~Defend the fort!~
@63019 = ~Guard the drawbridge!~
@63020 = ~Don't let them in!~
@63021 = ~Drive them back!~
@63022 = ~Defend Khalid!~
@63023 = ~Rally, defenders!~
@63024 = ~Hold your ground!~
@63025 = ~Target their mages!~
@63026 = ~I'm hit!~
@63027 = ~Form up!~
@63028 = ~Bottleneck 'em!~
@63029 = ~For Bridgefort!~
@63030 = ~For Baldur's Gate!~
@63031 = ~Help the defenders!~
@63032 = ~Rally to the fort!~
@63033 = ~Aargh!~
@63034 = ~The archers! Get the archers!~
@63035 = ~Hit 'em hard!~
@63036 = ~Face the Flaming Fist!~
@63037 = ~Let's show them our steel!~
@63038 = ~The crusade ends here!~
@63039 = ~Attack!~
@63040 = ~Take them down!~
@63041 = ~I'm hurt!~
@63042 = ~Find a weak spot!~
@63043 = ~To me!~
@63044 = ~Drive them back!~
@63045 = ~For the Shining Lady! Victory for the crusade!~
@63046 = ~We will triumph!~
@63047 = ~Attack!~
@63048 = ~Take the fort!~
@63049 = ~Caelar preserve us!~
@63050 = ~Help!~
@63051 = ~A righteous battle!~
@63052 = ~For the crusade!~
@63053 = ~Glory and honor!~
@63054 = ~We fight for right!~
@63055 = ~I'm injured!~
@63056 = ~Kill the defenders!~
@63057 = ~The fort is ours!~
@63058 = ~Remember your training!~
@63059 = ~Press on!~
@63060 = ~A grim battle. It's over now, but I fear there are worse trials ahead.~
@63061 = ~My wounds I got are nothing compared to the ones I gave.~
@63062 = ~Thank the gods you were with us out there! ~
@63063 = ~The fort is secure. I knew we were the superior force. Well, I was pretty sure.~
@63064 = ~The crusade retreats, they've left all manner of useful equipment behind.~
@63065 = ~You certainly turned the tide of battle out there. Thank you.~
@63066 = ~My sword broke during the battle! Fortunately, I had a spare blade on me.~
@63067 = ~I'll tell my grandchildren the story of the day I fought at Bridgefort.~
@63068 = ~I guess it's useful having a skilled adventurer on your side in battle.~
@63069 = ~I'm injured, but I'll survive.~
@63070 = ~Victory! Victory for Bridgefort!~
@63071 = ~Khalid led us to victory. Well, I suppose you helped too.~
@63072 = ~The Flaming Fist came through for us during the battle. It almost makes up for their arrogance.~
@63073 = ~That was over more quickly than I expected.~
@63074 = ~No time to chat—I have to help with the wounded.~
@63075 = ~We're saved!~
@63076 = ~Now we can leave this fort and find a new place to start over.~
@63077 = ~You dealt the crusade a blow, to be sure, but they're far from defeated. I fear I may never be able to return home.~
@63078 = ~I never want to witness a battle again. What I experienced will haunt my dreams the rest of my days.~
@63079 = ~I'm staying at the fort until I figure out where to go next. The roads aren't safe now, anyway.~
@63080 = ~Is the road to Baldur's Gate safe, do you think?~
@63081 = ~I hid under my bed for the entire battle. Who won?~
@63082 = ~If I can find a farm in need of another hand, I might be able to save up some money. Then I can start my own farm again one day.~
@63083 = ~Thank you for your aid, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. ~
@63084 = ~I've been hearing stories of your bravery, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@63085 = ~Battle's over. We celebrate now, right? We should tap a keg of dwarven ale! Or elven cider. No, no, definitely the ale.~
@63086 = ~So much killing. I fled here to escape it, and it followed me. I dare not travel to a major city.~
@63087 = ~I wonder what the crusade's next move will be. I hope they leave us common folk alone for a time.~
@63088 = ~You probably enjoyed that. I've heard tales of your bloodthirstiness.~
@63089 = ~As far as I'm concerned, everyone in this fort deserves a barrel of gold.~
@63090 = ~I don't see why the City of Splendors is involved with this. Let the Flaming Fist handle it, I say.~
@63091 = ~Greetings, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@63092 = ~We Waterdhavians know how to get the job done.~
@63093 = ~Torsin de Lancie knows what he's doing. He'll push Caelar's rabble back to Dragonspear and snuff them out for good.~
@63094 = ~I've many duties to attend to. Excuse me.~
@63095 = ~The Flaming Fist is a bunch of thugs from a city of thugs. We don't need them here.~
@63096 = ~This waiting is tedious. While we sit, Caelar grows ever stronger.~
@63097 = ~Have you ever been to Waterdeep? A grand city. Someone like you wouldn't last a day.~
@63098 = ~Lovely <DAYNIGHTALL>, isn't it? It'll be lovelier still when we march on Dragonspear.~
@63099 = ~Once we're on the battlefield, you'll see some real fighting. ~
@63100 = ~I'd kill for a dinner from the Friendly Flounder right about now.~
@63101 = ~What this camp needs is a top-notch minstrel act. Something with tumblers.~
@63102 = ~It's an honor to meet you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@63103 = ~The crumbling walls of Dragonspear Castle are no match for our forces. We should strike now!~
@63104 = ~Two of my family members joined the crusade. If I face them in battle, I don't know what I'll do.~
@63105 = ~Nederlok is a great officer. I'd follow him into a dragon's lair. I bet he could have taken care of Sarevok by himself.~
@63106 = ~Greetings, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Watch yourself around these parts, I don't trust those Daggerfordians. Bunch of bumblers, they are.~
@63107 = ~The Daggerford militia better be ready to deal with a real battle. We're not dealing with chicken thieves or diseased gibberlings here.~
@63108 = ~My children will love to hear how I met the hero of Baldur's Gate. I'm not so pleased. I've heard rumors about you.~
@63109 = ~I have many duties to attend to. Excuse me.~
@63110 = ~I've a bottle of winter wine in my pack. I'm saving it for after we crush the crusade. ~
@63111 = ~Hurry up and wait, as we say in the Fist.~
@63112 = ~Good to see Captain Corwin here. She's a good officer. Won't be long before she's running the Fist herself.~
@63113 = ~Lovely <DAYNIGHTALL>, isn't it?~
@63114 = ~I'll not turn my back on you when we march on Dragonspear. I know what you're capable of.~
@63115 = ~We'll do Baldur's Gate proud. Would that the same could be said of the Waterdhavians, or Daggerford's militia.~
@63116 = ~Once we've crushed this crusade, we can all go home.~
@63117 = ~It's an honor to meet you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@63118 = ~Tempus smiles upon us. Victory will be ours!~
@63119 = ~Marching on Dragonspear Castle will settle my jitters. All this waiting grates on the nerves.~
@63120 = ~Haither Stonehand will lead us to victory! The militia will prove we're equal to the Flaming Fist and the Waterdeep guard.~
@63121 = ~Greetings, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Watch yourself around these parts; I trust the Fist and the Waterdhavians about as far as I can throw them.~
@63122 = ~Waterdhavians think they're special because they come from the City of Splendors. Daggerford's blades are just as sharp. Maybe sharper.~
@63123 = ~Camp food gives me terrible indigestion, but I still can't get enough of it.~
@63124 = ~I got things to do. Excuse me. ~
@63125 = ~What I wouldn't give to be having a drink at the Happy Cow right now. And some sharpcrumble cheese. I suppose that's what I'm fighting for.~
@63126 = ~Bored, bored, BORED. This waiting's driving me mad. Ain't nothing to do but sit back and feel our arses get soft.~
@63127 = ~I heard wolves howling last night, and some other animal noises I couldn't place. Be careful if you leave camp.~
@63128 = ~Better we fight the crusade here that Daggerford's gates.~
@63129 = ~A warm bedroll and a dry pair of socks are a soldier's best friends.~
@63130 = ~Drills and more drills. I suppose that's better than being held at spearpoint by a bunch of bloodthirsty crusaders.~
@63131 = ~I just want the battle over with. Let's get to the fighting!~
@63132 = ~An honor to meet you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@63133 = ~Some say Caelar's forces have divine protection. Her people fall easy enough, but I heard tell of her priests doing weird resurrection ceremonies.~
@63134 = ~Dragonspear will fall; Daggerford will be saved. I've seen it.~
@63135 = ~Not all of us trust you. I don't.~
@63136 = ~Just keep walkin'.~
@63137 = ~You know what people say of you. How are we supposed to trust you?~
@63138 = ~I don't like the look of your eyes. There's something in you makes me shiver.~
@63139 = ~I don't know why the Council of Four puts so much faith in you.~
@63140 = ~You can't wait to get out there and start killing people, can you?~
@63141 = ~I don't want to be seen talking to you.~
@63142 = ~I, uh... I have to go.~
@63143 = ~Some say you're a hero. We'll see.~
@63144 = ~"Hero." Right. You give Baldur's Gate a bad name.~
@63145 = ~We can win this battle without you.~
@63146 = ~The way I see it, you being here causes more problems than it solves.~
@63147 = ~I've more important things to do than talk to you. I wouldn't want to talk to you even if I didn't.~
@63148 = ~Pardon me, I didn't see you there.~
@63149 = ~It takes a lot of effort to keep a camp this size running smoothly.~
@63150 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@63151 = ~The trick to serving soldiers is to give the food interesting names: It's not squirrel soup, it's "Woodland Surprise."~
@63152 = ~Some say you're a hero. I say soldiers who do their own laundry are the real heroes.~
@63153 = ~If you think you might die tomorrow, you'll probably spend more today.~
@63154 = ~Never a lack of things to do around camp, I can tell you that much.~
@63155 = ~I'll be glad when this ill-fated crusade is ended.~
@63156 = ~War may be bad for people, but it's great for business.~
@63157 = ~Soldiers can requisition supplies at the quartermaster's tent.~
@63158 = ~A well-supplied camp keeps troop morale high.~
@63159 = ~Thank goodness there's no cavalry units here. Then we'd have some real cleaning up to do.~
@63160 = ~Where'll we put all the prisoners if the crusade surrenders? To the sword, I say. Put them to the sword.~
@63161 = ~I'm glad we're not marching in winter. That's a trial.~
@63162 = ~I lost everything... everything.~
@63163 = ~Our home is gone. Where will we live now?~
@63164 = ~The crusade took what they wanted and left me in the dust.~
@63165 = ~It's good to see three strong forces working together. Well, two strong ones and the Daggerfordians.~
@63166 = ~Once the roads are clear, I'm going to Daggerford with the militia. Maybe I can start over there.~
@63167 = ~At least we're alive. That's the important thing.~
@63168 = ~Make the crusaders pay for what they did to us.~
@63169 = ~This battle will be one for the history books.~
@63170 = ~I was thinking of moving anyway.~
@63171 = ~If we lose do you think the crusaders will take us prisoner? Not that we're going to lose. But if we DID lose... Prisoners? You think?~
@63172 = ~Greetings, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@63173 = ~Fine <DAYNIGHTALL>, isn't it?~
@63174 = ~The hero of Baldur's Gate? Thank the gods. We could use a hero right now.~
@63175 = ~You've better things to do than talk to me, I'm sure.~
@63176 = ~Good day, <SIRMAAM>.~
@63177 = ~Greetings, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@63178 = ~I don't recognize you. You must be new.~
@63179 = ~Have we met before? I feel like I've seen your face before.~
@63180 = ~The Shining Lady's enemies will be crushed against the gates of Dragonspear!~
@63181 = ~I've never been in battle before, but the gods will shield me. Caelar has promised it.~
@63182 = ~Caelar is an inspiration. I could listen to her speak for a tenday. Longer, even.~
@63183 = ~Our victory is inevitable. We have a righteous cause and the Shining Lady on our side.~
@63184 = ~We make our stand here. Dragonspear Castle is ours!~
@63185 = ~Those trolls will come in handy. Those fools outside won't know what hit them.~
@63186 = ~A good <DAYNIGHTALL> to you.~
@63187 = ~All glory to Caelar! Victory for the Shining Lady!~
@63188 = ~No time to talk, lots to do. Walk ever in Caelar's light.~
@63189 = ~Is there something I can help you with?~
@63190 = ~An attack could come at any moment. Keep your weapon close at hand.~
@63191 = ~Morale Officer Deneld knows how to get the best out of his people. His speeches are the best part of my day.~
@63192 = ~This here is a critical location. We can't let anyone but crusaders in. The others depend on us!~
@63193 = ~Ogres lived here when we arrived. Some died, some fled. Running them off's the most fun I have in the last ten tendays.~
@63194 = ~Hello, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@63195 = ~I like it out here. It's more peaceful than the castle.~
@63196 = ~The squirrels here like to filch your dinner when you're not looking. I kill 'em if I see 'em. You'd be wise to do the same.~
@63197 = ~What do you need, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?~
@63198 = ~Keep your eyes peeled. Enemy forces could use the trees as cover.~
@63199 = ~We will hold the caverns or die in the attempt.~
@63200 = ~I swore to serve Caelar. Whatever she commands, I will do.~
@63201 = ~These caverns belong to the Shining Lady.~
@63202 = ~I hear those working in the caverns don't have much to do. Wouldn't that be nice?~
@63203 = ~Be cautious if you wander the woods. There are wolves out there. And worse than wolves.~
@63204 = ~I'm so bored.~
@63205 = ~Hope I get to go on patrol soon. Least it's something to do.~
@63206 = ~Say, you look... kinda familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?~
@63207 = ~Hello, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@63208 = ~I hate being underground. Never know if the sun's up or not.~
@63209 = ~This is the life. Nothing to do but relax and wait for battle.~
@63210 = ~I've won the last twelve games of "rock, parchment, dagger." I'm unstoppable!~
@63211 = ~I might try to find something to do later on, if I feel like it.~
@63212 = ~Ladle sure likes to yell. Not our fault there's nothing to do round here.~
@63213 = ~Thanks to the fish-men blocking the passage, we're stuck here. Guess I'll take another nap.~
@63214 = ~Since I have so much spare time, I've been composing a poem.~
@63215 = ~There's so much to DO now.~
@63216 = ~Work work work, that's all we do now.~
@63217 = ~Begging your pardon, but I'm very busy at the moment.~
@63218 = ~With the fish-men gone, we can get back to work. That's good, I guess.~
@63219 = ~My back hurts. Too much lifting.~
@63220 = ~Why'd you have to go and get rid of the sahuagin, huh?~
@63221 = ~Ladle's giving out jobs left and right. Just our luck.~
@63222 = ~I signed up to fight, not to haul supply crates.~
@63223 = ~Something I can do for you?~
@63224 = ~I hate being underground. Can't tell noon from night down here.~
@63225 = ~I heard you got rid of those fishfolk without half trying. You must think you're something special. Well, guess what? You are. You're pretty special, friend.~
@63226 = ~You look kinda familiar. I could swear I've seen—maybe just heard about—someone that looks just like you...~
@63227 = ~Out of the way, please. Supplies coming through.~
@63228 = ~At least I'm not bored anymore.~
@63229 = ~No time to talk, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I have duties assigned to me.~
@63230 = ~It's so dark down here. Dark and creepy.~
@63231 = ~There are a lot of strange creatures down here. Be careful.~
@63232 = ~Keep watch for intruders. Don't let anyone who's not a crusader through these tunnels.~
@63233 = ~I thought I heard something screaming in the walls. Maybe it was a ghost...~
@63234 = ~Watch your step. There are a lot of slimy things down here.~
@63235 = ~All our work is for Caelar's glory, not our own.~
@63236 = ~It's nice and cool down here. I like it.~
@63237 = ~How much longer will we be down here, you think? The battle can't come soon enough for me.~

@63580 = ~If any of the priests survived, maybe they'll have something to offer. If not, Coldhearth had a chest he kept a close eye on. He was first t'fall—doubt he'd mind me takin' it as payment for my troubles.~
@63581 = ~ 'Course, if someone ELSE wanted to go in there an' try for the chest while I recover, I could be convinced to split the take with 'em.~
@63582 = ~There may still be people alive in there and all you can think of is gold?~
@63583 = ~So I do the work and you reap the rewards? Think again, friend.~
@63584 = ~I will go explore this dig—but whatever I find will be mine and mine alone.~
@63585 = ~Burn yer bones, y'wretched clutchcoins! Fine. I'm in no state t'stop you. But if y'go in there, keep yer axe high an' Haela be with you—you'll need her.~
@63586 = ~Well, it was worth a try. Listen, it's possible some o' the order is still alive in there. If you can do anything for 'em, I'd appreciate it. As soon as I'm fit t'fight, I'll be goin' back in, but that may be a while. Either way, y'did me a good turn an' I hope the best for ya. Axes high, friend.~
@63587 = ~See that cavern there? The clerics, an' Coldhearth too, they were, y'know that thing...? Adamant. They were adamant no one who happened along see anything suspicious, 'specially if that no one served whatsername, Caelar.~
@63588 = ~They were so worried about someone coming along outside. Shoulda been more concerned about what they'd find inside.~
@63589 = ~What exactly happened in there?~
@63590 = ~They had you to assist with whatever they might encounter... At least they thought they did.~
@63591 = ~I am concerned about neither.~
@63592 = ~Aye? Well, that's prob'ly the healthiest position t'take on things. Fer myself, I'm gonna rest, recover my strength, an' head back into yon caverns. The wizard Coldhearth had a chest I'd like a closer look at, y'know what I mean.~
@63593 = ~Oy! I do my job, and I'm good at it. Pile all the things I killed up in a stack, an'—well, it'd be a big stlarnin' pile, that's all I'm saying.~
@63594 = ~An' you can bet when I've got my strength back, I'll be going in there to add to it. If the Luckmaiden smiles, I might find one o' them priests still alive an' actually get paid for this mess.~
@63595 = ~If not, the wizard, Coldhearth, had a chest he kept a close eye on. He was first t'fall—doubt he'd mind me takin' it as payment for my troubles.~
@63596 = ~The clerics were diggin' down—fifth, sixth tunnel they started, lookin' for whatever it was Deepvein was lookin' for, some kinda metal he had a vision about. Vision, feh, he was probably just in his cups... But Coldhearth came along. He doesn't strike me as the sort t'waste time on flights o' fancy.~
@63597 = ~Anyway, they dug down an' they hit... something. It weren't some vein of ore, either, it was fulla them things you helped me with an' more besides.~
@63598 = ~Coldhearth went down first. Couldn't turn undead the way the clerics could, not that it helped them long—two blinks of a deaf man's eye an' half the order was gone. Me an' the others fell back. I told 'em to leave it an' come out, but Auchlin Deepvein, he wasn't goin' anywhere, not if it meant lettin' those beasties loose on th'surface.~
@63599 = ~He couldn't help it, though. Couple got out—y'saw me fightin' 'em. There's more where they came from. Soon as I get my strength back, I'll be goin' in, seein' if anyone's still alive. If not, I'll uh, look for a way t'make this mess worth my while, if you know what I mean.~
@63600 = ~There are dwarves of good faith in need and all you're interested in is gold?~
@63601 = ~I know what you mean.~
@63602 = ~I'll leave you to rest, then.~
@63603 = ~Nah, nah. I'm also interested in gems, an' items of value. An' if any of 'em're still alive, I'll do what I can, o' course.~
@63604 = ~I'm not makin' any apologies for doin' what I got to. It's a hard world. Gotta be a hard man to live in it. Now if you'll give me some time, I need to rest—build me strength back up. Axes high, friend.~
@63605 = ~Aye. Aye, y'do that. Take care, friend, an' keep yer axes high.~
@63606 = ~Ye're back, good. I heard some screams comin' from the dig. I think some o' the clerics may still be alive. ~
@63607 = ~If they are, I'll find them and do everything in my power to keep them that way.~
@63608 = ~That's good for the clerics, I suppose. Why is it good for me?~
@63609 = ~And I'm to care about this because...?~
@63610 = ~Project like this isn't cheap. A friend o' Deepvein's, the wizard Gurn Coldhearth, he sunk more'n a little gold into the venture. Had a chest with 'im—bet there's plenty in it that'd be good for you.~
@63611 = ~I care little for material wealth, but I'll not ignore a call to adventure. You stay here and regain your strength—I'll venture into the dig.~
@63612 = ~It's worth checking out, at least. All right, I'll see what there is to see in yon caves.~
@63613 = ~I'll consider the matter.~
@63614 = ~Yeah, you do that. I'd come with ya, had I the strength. Watch yer back in there, an' keep yer axe high. Luck to ya.~
@63615 = ~You do that—but do it quickly. If there is anyone alive in there, I got a feeling they won't be much longer.~
@63616 = ~What're y'doin'? Y'said you'd see if anyone was alive inside the dig. Get to it! ~
@63617 = ~Well? What did y'see inside?~
@63618 = ~Your cleric friends. Some are alive, and they could probably use your help.~
@63619 = ~Your employers, fighting off an undead horde.~
@63620 = ~So many things. Undead, more undead, a giant, I think there were a couple salamanders in there, a dwarven lich—that's something you don't see everyday. Quite the adventure.~
@63621 = ~Nothing of any consequence.~
@63622 = ~Did you help them? ~
@63623 = ~I did. Auchlin Deepvein survives. He could probably use your help.~
@63624 = ~I tried. There was nothing I could do for them.~
@63625 = ~Why would I do that?~
@63626 = ~Their lives mean nothing to me.~
@63627 = ~Oh, aye? Yeah, awright. I'm good enough t'go. 'Scuse me.~
@63628 = ~If simple decency ain't enough reason t'help, you should know the clerics always paid me well, and on time to boot.~
@63629 = ~I'll do what I can to help them.~
@63630 = ~Then maybe you should be helping them.~
@63631 = ~Very well. I'll do what I can, but if they don't have the gold to make it worth my while, it's your hide.~
@63632 = ~An' the clerics? Any left alive? ~
@63633 = ~Auchlin Deepvein yet lives. He'd probably like to speak with you.~
@63634 = ~None.~
@63635 = ~If you want to know, go find out for yourself.~
@63636 = ~Hammer me flat. What a waste. Well, you've done me a good turn and I thank you for that. Haela be with ya. Keep yer axe high.~

@63652 = ~Ye've returned. What did ye find? Any sign o' Gurn Coldhearth?~ [BD63652]
@63653 = ~None. But the search continues.~
@63654 = ~I found his journal. Gurn Coldhearth is not the man you thought he was.~

@63656 = ~Gurn Coldhearth is no more. The lich that replaced him bid me kill you.~
@63657 = ~I found him—what he'd become, at least. Your friend was transformed into a lich. I had no choice but to destroy him.~
@63658 = ~Who?~
@63659 = ~I thank ye and bless ye fer th' effort. Let me know should anythin' turn up, aye?~
@63660 = ~Gurn Coldhearth—? Me dearest friend these past forty years? Don't tell me ye fergot who ye was lookin' for in there.~
@63661 = ~Fear not, Brother Deepvein. I will find your friend, I swear it.~
@63662 = ~Oh. Him. Yes. No, haven't seen him. Sorry.~
@63663 = ~I was looking for things that interest me, and will continue to do so. If you've any thoughts about that, keep them to yourself.~
@63664 = ~Be away wi' ye, then, an' don't bother talkin' tae me again 'less ye got Gurn's body fer me.~
@63665 = ~Gurn Coldhearth—me dearest friend these past forty years. He sacrificed 'imself to save me and me fellows. I canna return tae the hold wi'out his body.~

@63667 = ~Finding him—what's left of him—won't be easy. And the longer you wait, the harder the task will become.~
@63668 = ~If I find his corpse, I may return it to you should I see fit.~
@63669 = ~What're ye talkin' about, y'wee empty-headed nunce? ~
@63670 = ~Gurn manipulated you, tricked you into traveling here that he might enrich himself.~
@63671 = ~Nothing. Nothing at all.~
@63672 = ~You think you serve your god? Fool. You serve no one but Gurn Coldhearth. He used you.~
@63673 = ~Gurn Coldhearth was a good man—one o' the best. I'll not have ye talk about him this way!~
@63674 = ~Read his journal yourself. You'll see I speak the truth.~
@63675 = ~I'll talk about him—about anyone—however I choose.~
@63676 = ~Let's see this "journal," then. Gurn's own words will show us whit's true. ~
@63677 = ~Here, take it.~
@63678 = ~You'll have to take my word for it.~
@63679 = ~Ye smear the name o' me friend an' want me tae take yer word for it? Nay, nay, we'll no' be havin' that. I'll read that journal one way or t'other. Defend yerself!~
@63680 = ~Were ye no' a dwarf, I'd be crushin' yer skull like an eggshell by noo. Hand over the journal, lest I ferget we share blood.~
@63681 = ~Here, then. See the evidence of Coldhearth's perfidy writ by his own hand.~
@63682 = ~Blood you'll shed in very short order if you don't mind your tongue.~
@63683 = ~Oh no, no, no, nooo... This can no' be! Coldhearth, ye ill-spawned bastert, how could ye do this tae me?~
@63684 = ~He is a disciple of Abbathor. You and your fellows were a sacrifice made in the name of greed.~
@63685 = ~I'll ask him when I see him.~
@63686 = ~You were weak. He took advantage of that weakness.~
@63687 = ~An' now he'd see himsel' transformed—give up his mortal life and become a lich! This cannae happen. It cannae!~
@63688 = ~It won't. I'll see to it.~
@63689 = ~It will—if I don't stop it. I want 500 gold and any treasure I find in yon caverns and beyond. Are we agreed?~
@63690 = ~It can and it will, if it hasn't already. Accept that fact and move on.~
@63691 = ~Aye. Aye. Whitever it takes t'see this falsebeard dead. Here, take this. Ye'll need it if ye're tae battle a lich.~

@63693 = ~We call it the Secret Revealed. Its light blinds an' burns all creatures o' unlife. It may help ye defeat the lich, but use it sparingly—it'll no' last long.~
@63694 = ~Now go—find Coldhearth an' lay the traitor low, before he gets what he seeks!~
@63695 = ~Move on, <PRO_HESHE> says. Aye, I'll move on, all right. When I've got me strength back, I'll move on intae those caves an' whatever's beyond an' Coldhearth will face a Deepvein's vengeance. If ye're no' willin' tae help, begone. I need tae rest an' gather me strength fer the comin' battle, an' yer face bugs me.~
@63696 = ~Coldhearth a lich? Och, ye lie, ye lyin' liar, ye! ~
@63697 = ~May the gods strike me down if I am. Coldhearth is no friend of yours—he came here to be transformed into a lich, and he succeeded.~
@63698 = ~As one person of faith to another, I swear to you what I say is true.~
@63699 = ~This is one dwarf talking to another, Deepvein, and I'm telling you, the Coldhearth you knew is no more.~
@63700 = ~Believe me or don't, it matters little to me. But were I you I'd pray never to see your friend Coldhearth again.~
@63701 = ~You'll be dead in a few seconds, so what you think of me is of little consequence.~
@63702 = ~Dumathoin take me eyes if ye're no' tellin' it true. Coldhearth betrayed me...~
@63703 = ~Physically, spiritually, emotionally, you're in no condition to face what your friend has become. Stay here. I'll try to deal with him.~
@63704 = ~Lich happens.~
@63705 = ~A betrayal enabled by your own carelessness.~
@63706 = ~Indeed he did—repeatedly. And I am the instrument of his final betrayal. Prepare to die.~
@63707 = ~The gods'll no' have a chance tae strike ye down—I'll be doin' it first, y'base treacherous deceiver! In Gurn Coldhearth's name, die!~
@63708 = ~An' ye'd best pray no' tae see me agin. Another day's rest an' I'd knock yer teeth from yer skull fer disrespectin' me friend so!~
@63709 = ~Ye've got tae help me. Though he betrayed me an' mine, I cannae fight Coldhearth. He's—he WAS—me oldest friend...~
@63710 = ~I'd not see friend slay friend, even under such dark circumstances as these. Stay here. I'll deal with the Coldhearth lich.~
@63711 = ~I'll take care of the problem—for a price. 1,000 gold when the deed is done. Agreed?~
@63712 = ~If you lack the mettle to face Coldhearth even after what he did, begone from this place. Move on with your life.~
@63713 = ~You'll not have to fight him—you'll be dead at my hands long before it comes to that.~
@63714 = ~Ye think ye've got the steel tae kill a servant o' the Keeper, eh? Well, bring whit ye got, then. Let's see an end tae this once an' fer all!~
@63715 = ~Coldhearth a lich? Begone wi' ye, aye, get ootta here! Ye lie!~
@63716 = ~I am truly sorry, Brother Deepvein. There's nothing I'd not have done to save him—but there was naught there to save. He betrayed you, plain and simple.~

@63718 = ~This is one dwarf talking to another, Deepvein, and I'm telling you, the Coldhearth you knew is no more.~

@63722 = ~That proves nothin' but that he's dead, at yer hand, most like. Had I the strength, I'd strike ye down TWICE, once fer insultin' me friend an' again fer killin' him, ye treacherous dung beetle!~
@63723 = ~Dumathoin keep me secrets. Ye speak the truth, don't ye? Tha' great mince prattletongue Coldhearth betrayed me...~
@63724 = ~I'm sorry you had to find out like this.~

@63795 = ~The disciples of the Secret Gleam carried with them a relic in five parts—the amulets of the Keeper of Secrets under the Mountain.~
@63796 = ~I am kind to those who do me a kindness—generous to those who serve my needs. Bring the five Keeper's amulets to me and I shall bestow upon you an item of great power. What say you?~ [BD63796]
@63797 = ~Amulets, you say? I believe I have them already—here, you see?~
@63798 = ~I'd crawl through a pit of maggots before doing your bidding, fiend. Die!~
@63799 = ~An intriguing proposition. Give me some time to consider it.~
@63800 = ~Yeah, all right. But for all the effort it better be an item of GREAT power. I'll not waste time on items of moderate to fair power.~
@63801 = ~It shall be done.~
@63802 = ~Take what time you need—it is one of many things I now have in abundance.~
@63803 = ~Go. Do not return here until you have all five of the amulets, or you will feel the wrath of Abbathor's greatest minion. GO!~
@63804 = ~Of course he does. Far be it from Deepvein to make anything easy. ~
@63805 = ~I said I needed all five amulets and this is what you give me? You try to cheat Coldhearth, Abbathor's hand on Toril? You will pay for this, mortal—pay for it with your life!~
@63806 = ~Let me have those! Yes, yes, they're perfect, they're—no! What treachery is this?~
@63807 = ~Let me see those! Yes, yes! The Keeper's secret becomes Abbathor's treasure! HAHAHAHA!~
@63808 = ~I'm happy you're happy.~
@63809 = ~I believe you mentioned something about an item of great power?~
@63810 = ~They are my treasures, lich—at least until you've fulfilled your end of the bargain.~
@63811 = ~You'll be happier still, I promise you that.~
@63812 = ~Here then: a reward for your service. Take it and your leave, before I change my mind.~
@63813 = ~After we leave this place, we go to face the Shining Lady, Caelar Argent. Perhaps you could assist us in this?~
@63814 = ~I know of her crusade. My journey here took months rather than weeks thanks to her followers' interference.~
@63815 = ~They'll cost you more than that if she moves beyond the Winding Water—and she will. She'll not allow something like you to operate without interference.~
@63816 = ~You go to fight her, you say? Very well. When the hour comes, you'll not do so alone.~
@63817 = ~This is too much, <CHARNAME>. We're not so desperate that we need to treat with liches.~ [BD63817]
@63818 = ~I told you to leave this place. There is nothing here for you but death. Begone! ~
@63819 = ~Hm? Oh. You've returned. Have you considered my offer? ~
@63820 = ~Considered and rejected it. Prepare to meet your end, foul one.~
@63821 = ~Uh, what offer was that again?~
@63822 = ~You want the amulets of the Keeper of Secrets Under the Mountain, correct? I have them here.~
@63823 = ~You would have the Keeper's amulets held by the disciples of Dumathoin, correct? I will fetch them for you.~
@63824 = ~Really? *sigh* The lich seeks five amulets held by his former colleagues, the dwarven clerics of the Talhund Order of Dumathoin's Secret Gleam. If I can be bothered to remember this, you should be able to manage the same.~ [BD63824]
@63825 = ~This evil's butt used to belong to a dwarf, Boo. I must aim my boot a little lower than usual.~ [BD63825]
@63826 = ~Thou givest this abomination that which it seeks? Thou'rt mad!~ [BD63826]
@63827 = ~The Rashemi witch has a point. We should be paid before we give up the amulets.~ [BD63827]
@63828 = ~That is not what I meant, and thou knowest full well it is not.~ [BD63828]
@63829 = ~Ah, you have returned. Did you do as I bid? ~
@63830 = ~I have brought you the Keeper's Amulets. Here.~
@63831 = ~I don't believe so. What was it you wanted again?~
@63832 = ~These things take time.~
@63833 = ~You don't bid me to do anything, lich. I am not some dog, ready to fetch at <PRO_HISHER> master's command.~
@63834 = ~My time is without end, but the same cannot be said of my patience. Come here again without the amulets of the Keeper of Secrets and you will pay a heavy price. Now GO!~ [BD63834]
@63835 = ~You bloody great lackwit! If you'll not serve me in life, I see that you do in death!~
@63836 = ~Robel~
@63837 = ~Ye have me thanks, stranger. Deepvein's me name, Brother Auchlin Deepvein of the Talhund Order o' Dumathoin's Secret Gleam—what's left of it. Ach, I shouldna complain, we'd none of us have survived that onslaught without yer aid.~ [BD63837]
@63838 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate. How did you come to be here?~
@63839 = ~I met another of your number, a Daran Highhammer, outside the cavern.~
@63840 = ~You're right. And one good turn deserves another, does it not?~
@63841 = ~I aided you. I've no wish to speak with you.~
@63842 = ~It's a reward ye're wantin' then? Ye earned one, sure enough, but there's little I have t'offer. What we didn't lose when the undead beasties stole Coldhearth is deep wi'in the dig, wi' all manner of horror 'round it. ~
@63843 = ~The undead stole your hearth?~
@63844 = ~How deep within the dig is "deep wi'in the dig"?~
@63845 = ~I've seen some of the horror. Now tell me, where's the profit?~
@63846 = ~Ye're like a dog wi' a sarkin' bone, aren't ye? Well, ye'll find ample treasure wi'in these caverns, assumin' ye don't die—which I'd not be assumin' were I in your boots.~
@63847 = ~Not a hearth, ye daft scullion! I speak o' Gurn Coldhearth—me oldest an' dearest friend an' what did I do—? Cost 'im his life is all.~
@63848 = ~By the grace o' Dumathoin and the gold o' me friend, Gurn Coldhearth. Ach, Gurn, forgive me...~
@63849 = ~He believed in me... When I told 'im the Keeper'd sent me a vision of a vein of ore runnin' through this ground, one I could forge into chains tae bind me tae great Dumathoin for all time, he didn't hesitate. He pulled 'is chest out an' he said, "How much do ye need tae find it, Auchlin?"~
@63850 = ~I gather you did not find the ore you sought?~
@63851 = ~Dumathoin? Who is that? What's so great about him, her, or it?~
@63852 = ~In addition to being god of mining and underground exploration, Dumathoin is guardian to the dwarven dead, is he not?~
@63853 = ~The Keeper of Secrets Beneath the Mountain watches over our dead—yet you were nearly overrun by undead.~
@63854 = ~I'm sure scrabbling in the dirt is endlessly fascinating to you, but it means nothing to me. Begone.~
@63855 = ~Aye, ye got that right. We worked an' worked, us buttressin' one tunnel while Semahl dug another. Eventually we hit somethin' but it weren't no ore, I'll tell ye that much.~
@63856 = ~Ye're a wise <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@63857 = ~Ye noticed that, did ye?~
@63858 = ~Dumathoin is guardian o' the dead, but the dark power we disturbed below didna care aboot that. We tunneled an' tunneled, an' eventually we hit something, but it weren't no ore.~
@63859 = ~It was a room full o' books—books an' the monsters ye saw us fightin'.~
@63860 = ~You tunneled into another cavern complex, this one inhabited?~
@63861 = ~Books, you say? I should like to see these books.~
@63862 = ~I encountered one of your brothers outside—a man named Daran Highhammer.~
@63863 = ~I've heard enough of this tale. More than enough, if truth be told.~
@63864 = ~T'weren't nae cavern. A buildin' o' some sort, buried gods know when, filled wi' death. The vile creatures poured out, killin half our number or more. Me friend Gurn Coldhearth sacrificed 'imself, holdin' 'em back while we tried t'seal the entrance—tried an' failed.~
@63865 = ~An' I'd like to see me friend Gurn Coldhearth again, but there's a sea o' livin' death 'twixt us an' that which we seek.~
@63866 = ~We've seen ye in battle, and we're in no shape tae fight. Leave us in peace and we'll do the same f'r ye.~
@63867 = ~Gurn Coldhearth falls an' that coward lives? Where's the justice in that, I ask ye? He was s'posed tae keep the beasties away from us—that was 'is job! Och, well, ye see him again, tell him tae get his biscuit-arse in here an' help us.~
@63868 = ~What will you do now?~
@63869 = ~I didn't say he was alive.~
@63870 = ~Tell me of this Coldhearth.~
@63871 = ~That's the way of it, eh? As ye wish it. We've seen ye in battle, and we're in no shape tae fight. Leave us in peace, and we'll do the same f'r ye.~
@63872 = ~Ye lost him, did ye? Well, we did no better. May Dumathoin keep him always, him an' Gurn Coldhearth both...~
@63873 = ~Me fellows an' I need time t'rest—tae heal. Once that's done, we'll venture back intae the caverns, slay the slain one one final time, an' find Gurn's body. I'll no' return tae the 'hold wi'out it.~
@63874 = ~Stay here and ensure no other undead escape. I'll venture into the caverns and find your friend.~
@63875 = ~Finding him—what's left of him—won't be easy. And the longer you wait, the harder the task will become.~
@63876 = ~If I find his corpse, I may return it to you should I see fit.~
@63877 = ~Ye're goin' deeper intae the caverns, then? Well, luck to ye wi' that. Ye'll surely need it in this pit o' darkness. We'll be here a time, makin' sure no other corpse-beasties escape this place.~
@63878 = ~I wish we were in any kind o' shape tae help ye out, but we're no'. Watch yer back in there.~
@63879 = ~Aye, ye're right about that an' no question. Tell ye what, though—before we began the dig, we buried some gold and stones above. Ye can never be too careful, aye? Find Gurn Coldhearth for us an' the treasure's yours. What do ye say?~
@63880 = ~I cannot take such a reward from one who's lost so much already. I will find your master for you, I swear it.~
@63881 = ~When you put it like that, I can't say no.~
@63882 = ~You said all you had was lost in the cavern.~
@63883 = ~Should I see fit to bother, I'll return his remains to you.~
@63884 = ~Aye, well, now ye know why they call Dumathoin the Keeper o' Secrets Under the Mountain. An' if ye wish t' benefit from those secrets, ye'd best be about findin' us Gurn's remains. We'll wait fer ye here an' make sure no other corpse-beasties escape this place.~
@63885 = ~Just make no promises as to the condition we'll find him in. Dwarves are not renowned for the grace with which they receive ill tidings.~ [BD63885]
@63886 = ~Really? Have we nothing better to do with our time than roll around in the dirt seeking a dead dwarf?~ [BD63886]
@63887 = ~Dumathoin will see us through this nightmare.~
@63888 = ~I fear the Keeper does not look kindly upon this venture.~
@63889 = ~What're you lookin' at? Er, I mean, Dumathoin bless 'n keep you.~
@63890 = ~Axes high, friend.~
@63891 = ~Heads up, hammer hard.~
@63892 = ~Holy metal, me holy arse...~
@63893 = ~How's the weather up there? HAW!~
@63894 = ~I cannae believe this happened tae Coldhearth. No' tae Coldhearth...~
@63895 = ~Dumathoin steel my soul, but I could use a drink.~
@63896 = ~Nuh! Nuh! Leave Semahl alone!~
@63897 = ~Please! Leave Semahl be! S-semahl...~
@63898 = ~...SEMAHL HURT YOU NOW.~
@63899 = ~Don't! Don't hurt Semahl! You hurt Semahl—Semahl hurt YOU!~
@63900 = ~You—you save Semahl...?~
@63901 = ~You looked like you could use saving.~
@63902 = ~I slew the monsters attacking you. Now just one monster remains, but you won't for long, I assure you.~
@63903 = ~I did. Are you going to make me regret that?~
@63904 = ~It was clear you couldn't save yourself. Have you no capacity for shame, beast?~
@63905 = ~All Semahl's little friends dead. Semahl all alone now. ~
@63906 = ~Little friends? You mean the dwarves? They're not all dead, Semahl. I talked to one named Auchlin at the cavern's entrance.~
@63907 = ~Do not tarry in this place, Semahl. You are too gentle a soul to stay in darkness. Seek out your own kind and perhaps you'll find some peace.~
@63908 = ~A creature such as you has no friends. You are an abomination, and I'll not suffer you to live a moment longer.~
@63909 = ~All things die—including you if you don't get out of my sight.~
@63910 = ~They alive. Semahl's friends alive! Oh, oh, oh, Semahl go, go see them now. Thank you, little <PRO_GIRLBOY>, thank you from Semahl!~
@63911 = ~A gentle giant. I've never seen the like.~
@63912 = ~I believe we've done a good deed this night. We should go find some more giants!~ [BD63912]
@63913 = ~Oh, let's not, please.~ [BD63913]
@63914 = ~Semahl go, Semahl go...~
@63915 = ~Though the air remains still and stagnant in the chamber, the pool atop the pedestal ripples and begins to swirl. You find yourself thinking of the people who have affected you most of late, of one especially...~
@63916 = ~Imoen...~
@63917 = ~Caelar Argent...~
@63918 = ~The Hooded Man...~
@63919 = ~No, I don't. I focus and clear my mind of thought until the pool's water goes still once again.~
@63920 = ~Concentrate, girl. Clear your mind of all thoughts.~ [BD63920]
@63921 = ~That should be easy. A lot of people say there isn't much thinking going on in there to begin with.~ [BD63921]
@63922 = ~You are not without wit, Imoen—but that will only take you so far. What you need... and currently lack... is focus.~ [BD63922]
@63923 = ~Forgive me, Duke Jannath. It's just—it's hard. My best friend is charging into a dragon's mouth, and I'm just—sitting here, thinking about magic and stuff.~ [BD63923]
@63924 = ~If you were truly thinking about magic, you'd not be talking so much.~ [BD63924]
@63925 = ~I made a mistake. I should never have let them go face Caelar without me.~ [BD63925]
@63926 = ~In your current state, you'd be nothing but a burden. If you truly want to help your friend, you must focus your mind and your energies on your studies.~ [BD63926]
@63927 = ~You're right. I know you're right.~ [BD63927]
@63928 = ~All right, what am I supposed to do again?~ [BD63928]
@63929 = ~Clear your mind...~ [BD63929]
@63930 = ~Clear my mind. Right. I can do that. Clearing my mind. Clearing my mind. Mind being cleared. Clear. Mind. Cleared mind. Cleeearrrrr miiiiind.~ [BD63930]
@63931 = ~You came. Good. I wasn't sure you would.~ [BD63931]
@63932 = ~I was curious. I had to learn who would be so arrogant, so foolish as to summon me in such a fashion. Who are you, who thinks himself my equal—my better, even, judging by your message's tone?~ [BD63932]
@63933 = ~Me? I am naught but a servant.~ [BD63933]
@63934 = ~If you know who I am, you know that I do not deal with the servants of others. If your master would speak with me, I am happy to do so—or has he grown so weak even his words can no longer reach this plane?~ [BD63934]
@63935 = ~Do not doubt my master's power—or our allies'.~ [BD63935]
@63936 = ~You think I doubt the Umbral Accord's power?~ [BD63936]
@63937 = ~If you respected it, you would not do as you did in Baldur's Gate. The child of Bhaal belongs to my master.~ [BD63937]
@63938 = ~I've done nothing to keep the godling from you.~ [BD63938]
@63939 = ~You are trying to influence Bhaal's spawn and in doing so you interfere with my master's business. The Accord will not let this continue.~ [BD63939]
@63940 = ~Perhaps you are right. Perhaps not. You do not speak for the Accord—and I do not bow to the demands of some broken fiend's lickspittle.~ [BD63940]
@63941 = ~Well, here we are in a creepy ol' tomb again. The last of Sarevok's followers are down here, according to the Flaming Fist. All you gotta do is find their leader and bring her to justice.~ [BD63941]
@63942 = ~I'd have an easier time of it if you came with me, Imoen.~
@63943 = ~What do we know of our prey?~
@63944 = ~Sounds simple enough. Let's get to it.~
@63945 = ~I really want to! I wouldn't be much help, though. Ever since I asked Duke Jannath to teach me how to sling spells, she's had me cooped up in the stuffy ol' library, studying boring books about the Weave. She only let me come down here after I promised to bring her any arcane scrolls or tomes I could find.~ [BD63945]
@63946 = ~That's unfortunate, but it's probably best to do as Duke Jannath says. Tell me what we know of those we hunt.~
@63947 = ~I'm ready to get started.~
@63948 = ~They're mostly mercenaries, led by a wizard named Korlasz—this is her family's tomb. She aided Sarevok, and the Grand Dukes want her dead or alive. We'd better be careful.~ [BD63948]
@63949 = ~We? Will you be joining me?~
@63950 = ~Let's get to it, then.~
@63951 = ~I'll follow behind you with these Flaming Fists. If you need help with anything, just ask and I'll do what I can.~ [BD63951]
@63952 = ~There's a healer here too. Talk to her if you need any bandaging. She also knows all about fighting undead.~ [BD63952]
@63953 = ~You're too late. It's already gone.~ [BD63953]
@63954 = ~What are you talking about?~
@63955 = ~Gone? What's gone? What are your prattling on about?~
@63956 = ~You waste the last minutes of your life with idle chatter. I'm coming for you.~
@63957 = ~Tymora be with you, then. If you're fool enough to cross Korlasz, you'll need all the luck you can get.~
@63958 = ~Heya, how are things going?~ [BD63958]
@63959 = ~What can you tell me about this place?~
@63960 = ~I'm more concerned about you. How have you been doing these last few weeks?~
@63961 = ~I require healing.~
@63962 = ~Well enough. Let's continue on.~
@63963 = ~No surprise there. Talk to the Flaming Fist healer and she'll patch you right up.~ [BD63963]
@63964 = ~The dukes said this whole place is the Korlasz family tomb. All her wizard ancestors are buried here, so be sure to keep an eye out for traps and other nasty things.~ [BD63964]
@63965 = ~Looks like someone was playing cards here, but they left in a hurry. Probably because we showed up. It's nice to know we've built up a reputation!~ [BD63965]
@63966 = ~This must be one of Korlasz's ancestor's tombs. Creepy. We should look for a way down to the lower level. I bet that's where Korlasz is.~ [BD63966]
@63967 = ~These tombs are older than Winthrop! Be careful disturbing them. Old wizard ghosts are notorious for leaving traps all over the place.~ [BD63967]
@63968 = ~On the floor... that's the symbol of Bhaal! Seems like some of Korlasz's ancestors worshiped him. I could've happily gone the rest of my life without seeing THAT symbol again.~ [BD63968]
@63969 = ~That symbol on the ground, I recognize it. It's the mark of Bane, god of tyrants. He was killed in the Time of Troubles like your, uh... like Bhaal was.~ [BD63969]
@63970 = ~These braziers are strange. They're obviously magical. I wonder why they're different colors? Hm. Maybe we'll figure out what they're for as we go along.~ [BD63970]
@63971 = ~I recognize this one. The symbol on the ground is the dead god Myrkul's. He was god of the dead—makes sense Korlasz's ancestors would have his mark here. It looks like they worshipped the Dead Three as a group, rather than individual deities.~ [BD63971]
@63972 = ~It's strange having these new arcane powers. Back in Candlekeep, I never dreamed I might be a spellslinger like Gorion some day. Life sure has taken us to unexpected places. You more than me, I guess.~ [BD63972]
@63973 = ~We'll follow behind you. I've got your back.~ [BD63973]
@63974 = ~Hey—you feel a breeze? I feel a breeze.~ [BD63974]
@63975 = ~Wow, look at the size of that door! There must be a lever or something to open it.~ [BD63975]
@63976 = ~That symbol sure looks familiar. How about we keep moving?~ [BD63976]
@63977 = ~This chasm sure looks deep. Do you feel warm air coming up from below? I do. Wonder what's down there?~ [BD63977]
@63978 = ~The braziers in here must be magical. The different colors really liven up this drab ol' place.~ [BD63978]
@63979 = ~To the death!~
@63980 = ~Kill the slayer of Sarevok!~
@63981 = ~Destroy <PRO_HIMHER>!~

"Dearest Karella,

Our journey to the Shadow King's outpost has been long and treacherous. Trolls, hobgoblins, gnolls, xvarts, and even a gargoyle stood 'twixt us and our goal, but we have finally made it across Coast Way Crossing. If the map purloined from the Netherese vampire steers us true, we cannot be far from our goal.

Even if this venture proves as profitable as Walkins believes it will be (I'll believe that when I see it and perhaps not even then), there are many more dangers ahead. No property of the Shadow King will be left undefended. At a minimum, we are told to expect resistance from a small army of minor undead, which do not concern me overmuch, and a lich under the influence of the King's Overmind, which concerns me greatly.

Once these threats are dealt with, the going should become much easier. Along with the map, the vampire 'supplied' us with a key it claimed opens the door to the Shadow King's Inner Sanctum. It spoke of a treasure room hidden within, loaded with items of great power and value.

I send this letter to you in the hopes that it finds you in good health and that we will be together again soon—but however soon that may be, it cannot be soon enough for my taste. Until then, I remain yours,

Agda Coldhearth"~
@64106 = ~Journal of Gurn Coldhearth~
@64107 = ~An inscription on the inside cover of this small leather journal identifies its owner as one Gurn Coldhearth. The lettering beneath the name is only legible after several seconds of study. Written by the same hand as Coldhearth's name, it read "Devoted of Dumathoin" before it was violently crossed out, tearing the paper in several places.

Gurn Coldhearth valued his secrets; the bulk of the journal's entries written in a complex code beyond your ability to decipher. The latest entry, however, was scrawled quickly across the page in the common language of the realms:

"Must record this quickly, before the memory fades. Last night as I slept, the mind of the Shadow King's lich touched mine. It confirmed that we will soon reach the outpost if we continue the dig. When we do, I will go to him and perform a ritual severing him from the Overmind. In exchange, he shall grant me what I seek—no longer need I live in fear of the sickness ravaging this body. I must push Deepvein and the others all the harder to continue digging until at last what I so richly deserve is finally mine."~
@64108 = ~Volume MCXII of the History of the Netherese Empire~
@64109 = ~Mud and mishandling have rendered this once-handsome volume all but unreadable. Judging from those few snippets that remain legible, the book appears to detail the life of a young boy who would one day rise to become Sorcerer-King of the Netherese enclave Jiksidur.

@64110 = ~Mortal to Lich Notes~
@64111 = ~Inside a leather folder embossed with the word LICH are several pieces of parchment written in a variety of languages, most of them foreign to you. Two sheets are legible, though. The first, written in a spidery hand, reads as follows:

"To complete the Ritual of Becoming, the subject's soul must be placed into their desired phylactery, either by the subject or the magician performing the ritual. After the etheric self has been safely stored, the physical changes required by the subject's impending state can begin. Magical energy absorbs much of the body's moisture; skin shrivels and often changes colour, giving the subject a corpse-like appearance. The subject may experience some physical or emotional discomfort as the changes take hold, but so long as their spiritual self is bound to its phylactery, there is no danger of it physically perishing. In fact, once the transformation is complete, the subject's continued physical existence can only be ended via the phylactery's destruction."

The writing on the second parchment, neater and more easily read, is quite possibly a professional scribe's work, presumably a copy or transcription of another's words:

"On the matter of Phylacteries
The phylactery is simultaneously the source of the lich's greatest power and its greatest, indeed its only significant physical weakness. Any independent lich should take pains to ensure its phylactery is kept secure at all times. Though not strictly necessary, the transition from mortal to lich is more easily achieved if the item which will store the transformee's soul (ie, the phylactery) is something with which they are familiar. This is particularly the case in Rituals of Becoming that are performed by a party other than the one undergoing transformation."~

@64117 = ~This moth-eaten volume describes the physical, spiritual, emotional, and moral dimensions of the lich in such aggrandizing terms that any conclusions it reaches are dubious at best. A passage underlined in red ink catches your eye. It reads:

"For inherent in undeath, and particularly in the state of Lichdom, is a reversal of nature's order. The winter that is the end of mortal life is a rebirth for the undead. The autumnal deterioration of life energy that precedes the mortal winter follows the rebirth in undeath, as the fragmenting of mind and body are sewn back together, resulting in a period of illumination during which the undead sees the world in all its brilliant facets. Finally, there is the Lich's spring, a season of growing power and vitality that can and will be sustained for an eternity, so long as their phylactery and physical vessel endure."~

@64130 = ~I used the murder as cover to distract my enemies from my REAL activities in Candlekeep. I was in control the whole time.~
@64131 = ~What about the attack in the Ducal Palace durin' the iron crisis? They say hundreds of doppelgangers attacked, with foot-long claws and giant fangs and the only thing that saved the dukes from being ripped apart was you.~
@64132 = ~Perhaps ten shapeshifters in all. The Flaming Fist protected the dukes, but I assisted. Sarevok escaped, though I put up a good fight.~
@64133 = ~Truth! The doppelgangers' fangs dripped poison; their claws could take a man's head with a single stroke. If not for me, the Council of Four would surely have died.~

I've learned all I can in the city. While my plans for the Iron Throne gain traction, I go to visit a temple of Bhaal overtaken by the faithful of he who murdered my father—leaving the way clear for ME to take his place. There I shall find out more regarding my dark heritage and the prophecy. If I have time, I shall also look into a hidden room rumored to have been constructed by Mask. The Lord of Shadows is cunning. The marks he has left behind number 3, 1, and 4.~
@64295 = ~Sarevok's Secret

I should watch for an old temple of Bhaal on my travels.

In the Korlasz family tomb, I found old research notes regarding the prophecy of Bhaal written by my half-brother Sarevok. He must have stayed here a time while developing his plans. The notes mention a secret room in an old temple of Bhaal and reference the "marks" left by the Lord of Shadows: 3, 1, and 4. Perhaps the numbers' significance will become clearer in time.~
@64296 = ~In the Time of Troubles, the god Mask, Lord of Shadows, hid himself within a blade of terrible power. Called Godsbane, the blade was sharp enough to bleed even a divine being. Cyric took up Godsbane when he faced Bhaal, Lord of Murder, on the mortal plane. Mask laughed from within the blade's steel as Cyric slew Bhaal and cast his body into the river below. The waters turned foul and tainted, poisoned evermore as the Lord of Murder's corpse sank beneath the surface.~

Thieves broke into a sarcophagus and stole a staff. A spirit now haunts the sarcophagus, looking for its lost staff. The weapon wasn't magical, and the thieves must have abandoned it in the tomb, as the original owner can sense its presence. If I find the staff, I should return it to the sarcophagus and put the spirit to rest.~

1360 DR
We have seized the temple of the Lord of Murder. We killed many of Bhaal's clergy. Others escaped, but I claimed a prize for myself: the high priestess Madele. I have caged her while I decide what glorious things to do with her. Praise Cyric. Fear the Dark Sun.

1363 DR
I decided once again not to sacrifice Madele. I take too much pleasure from her madness. Instead, I removed her eyes and roasted them in a brazier as an offering to my lord Cyric. I ate them afterwards, their smoky, blistered jelly a delightful treat. The pathetic wretch continues to cry out to her dead god. I've filled her head with tales of Cyric's rise, and she believes my lord rules over all the darkened land (as someday he will!).

1365 DR
We have a pleasant routine, my Madele and I. Once a tenday I visit her, sometimes more, sometimes less. I have forgotten about her once or twice, and she's had to eat her own offerings of rats and lizards she murders in Bhaal's name. Then I spin my tales of Cyric's dominance until she works herself into a frenzy. Last week she actually collapsed in a fit, thrashing and choking. I watched her until it passed, letting her own body decide whether to kill her or not.

I line them up side by side. The Lord of Murder likes order. He will return, I know he will, and then he will see how faithful I've remained. Then I shall torment Akanna as she has tormented me. I'll take HER eyes, roast them, and feed them to her, one by one. And then regrow them! AND MAKE HER EAT THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND

Head aches so badly. I feel someone whispering to me in the dark. Is it Bhaal? Has my lord returned? The voice tells me my penance is almost at an end. Akanna's rule here is done. It MUST be the Lord of the Murder, but I hear the voice so faintly and my head... my head...~

I've reported back to Deepvein.

I told Auchlin Deepvein of his friend Gurn Coldhearth's deception. He was not well pleased.~
@64416 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I've reported back to Deepvein.

I told Auchlin Deepvein of his friend Gurn Coldhearth's deception. He would not have believed it, had not the giant I found earlier, Semahl, spoken out and confirmed my claims. Deepvein is not well pleased by this development.~
@64417 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I should seek out and destroy Coldhearth, in whatever form he now takes.

I told Auchlin Deepvein of his friend Gurn Coldhearth's transformation from mortal to lich. He was not well pleased. I have agreed to seek out Coldhearth and avenge those sacrificed in his pursuit of power.~
@64418 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I should seek out and destroy Coldhearth, in whatever form he now takes.

I told Auchlin Deepvein of his friend Gurn Coldhearth's induction into lichhood. He would not have believed it, had not the giant I found earlier, Semahl, spoken out and confirmed my claims. Deepvein was not well pleased. I have agreed to seek out Coldhearth and avenge those sacrificed in his pursuit of power.~
@64419 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I've dealt with Coldhearth and may have a deal with the dwarves.

With Gurn Coldhearth dealt with, the dwarven clerics of Dumathoin led by Auchlin Deepvein find themselves at loose ends. I suggested they join us in the battle against Caelar Argent. Deepvein will consider the matter as they consecrate the dig site and the lich's stronghold below.~
@64420 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I should return to Coldhearth with the amulets.

I have slain Gurn Coldhearth's pawns and collected that which he desires, the five Amulets of the Keeper of Secrets Under the Mountain.~
@64421 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I must search for the lost dwarf, Coldhearth.

The dwarven cleric Auchlin Deepvein has convinced me to search for his friend, Gurn Coldhearth, who was lost when the dwarves' dig intersected with a previously existing structure buried below.~
@64422 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I must seek out and destroy Coldhearth, in whatever form he takes now.

I told Auchlin Deepvein of his friend's transformation into a lich. He supplied me with a mystic weapon, the Secret Revealed, that may help me dispatch the monster.~
@64423 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I should tell the dwarves of the giant I killed.

In a remote corner of the dwarven clerics' secret dig, I encountered a giant of hideous countenance under attack by undead. I slew it.~
@64424 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I should tell the dwarves of the giant's death.

In a remote corner of the dwarven clerics' secret dig, I encountered a giant of hideous countenance under attack by undead. Though it claimed a friendship with the clerics, it was still a giant and so I had little choice but to destroy it.~
@64425 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I should tell the dwarves about the giant.

In a remote corner of the secret dwarven dig, I rescued the giant Semahl from the creatures attacking him. He claims to be a friend of the dwarves behind this dig. I sent him to the cave's entrance to rejoin those who survived the undead onslaught.~
@64426 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I should return to the dwarves and tell them what I know about Coldhearth.

While exploring the structure the dwarven clerics broke into, I located the wizard Gurn Coldhearth—just in time to see him transformed into a lich. He seems pleased with the change. He is not the man his friend Brother Deepvein believed him to be. It would be foolhardy in the extreme to try and battle any lich in its place of power. The wisest course of action now is to seek out the servants of Dumathoin and tell them what their friend has become.~
@64427 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I should return to the dwarves and tell them what I know about Coldhearth.

After making my way through the fortress the dwarven clerics inadvertently unearthed, I found the wizard Gurn Coldhearth—too late to prevent his transformation into a lich. It would be foolhardy in the extreme to try and battle any lich in its place of power. The wisest course of action now is to seek out the servants of Dumathoin and tell them what their friend has become.~
@64428 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I must find the Coldhearth lich's phylactery.

I have hurt the Coldhearth lich, but I cannot destroy it utterly until I find and destroy its phylactery. It must be somewhere in this area.~
@64429 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I must destroy the Coldhearth lich's phylactery to kill it permanently.

I located the Coldhearth lich's phylactery in a hidden room off the chamber in which its transformation occurred. Destroying the phylactery will give me the advantage I needed to end the monster's miserable existence.~
@64430 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I should look for the five amulets of the Keeper of Secrets Under the Mountain.

The Coldhearth lich made me an intriguing proposition: If I acquire several items from its former followers, the five amulets of the Keeper of Secrets Under the Mountain, the lich promises a great reward.~
@64431 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I have finished my dealings with Coldhearth.

I gave the Coldhearth lich the five amulets of the Keeper. It was as good as its word. I was well rewarded for my service.~
@64432 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

When a lich says it wants five amulets, it is wisest to give it no less than five amulets.~
@64433 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I have finished my dealings with Coldhearth.

After some deliberation, I decided not to give the Coldhearth lich the amulets it sought.~
@64434 = ~Dwarves of Dumathoin

I have finished my dealings with Coldhearth.

The Coldhearth lich did not deal well with my challenging its authority. It dealt with me destroying its phylactery, followed by its wretched existence even worse.~
@64435 = ~A Remote View of Caelar Argent

In the waters of a scrying pool, I was able to witness Caelar Argent addressing her followers. I begin to understand the regard her devotees hold her in.~
@64436 = ~A Remote View of Imoen

I witnessed a vision in a pool.

In the waters of a scrying pool, I was able to glimpse Imoen, being trained in the ways of magic by Grand Duke Liia Jannath. She is worried about me, as I am for her.~
@64437 = ~Remote View of a Hooded Man

I witnessed a vision in a pool.

In the waters of a scrying pool, I managed to catch a glimpse of the strange, scar-faced man I've encountered briefly in my travels. He spoke to a man I did not recognize, about a child of Bhaal. Did they mean me? Sarevok? Or does the Lord of Murder have even more children wandering the Sword Coast?~
@64438 = ~Remote View of a Hooded Man

I witnessed distant events in a scrying pool.

In a scrying pool's waters, I observed the scar-faced man I've encountered briefly in my travels in conversation with a man I've seen before—a servant of Caelar Argent. They spoke of a child of Bhaal. Did they mean me? Sarevok? Or does the Lord of Murder have other children wandering the Sword Coast? Whatever the case, the tone of their interaction makes me question Caelar's claims of divine sanction for her actions.~
@64439 = ~Spikes shot up from the floor and impaled these crusaders, killing them.~
@64440 = ~The Missing Patrol

I must find the missing crusader patrol in a ruined temple to the east.

According to the gate guard, the crusader camp isn't allowing any new members to join. Due to the assault against Bridgefort they don't trust potential recruits. If I want to bluff my way into the camp, I'll have to prove myself by tracking down a missing crusader patrol. One of the scouts, Keherrem, is the nephew of the crusade's recruiting officer. The missing patrol might be in a ruined temple to the east.~
@64441 = ~The Missing Patrol

I've found a way into the crusader camp.

I found and rescued the missing patrol. I've been granted access to the crusader camp. Hopefully from within I can find a way to end the siege against Bridgefort.~
@64442 = ~The Missing Patrol

I've found a way into the crusader camp.

I found the missing patrol and killed them. I told the crusaders that the patrol died at the hands of the Cyricists and they believed me. I've been granted access to the crusader camp. Hopefully from within I can find a way to end the siege against Bridgefort.~
@64443 = ~The Missing Patrol

I can free the crusaders to gain access to the camp, or use the switch on the wall to kill them.

I found the missing crusader patrol. If I can free them, I might be able to gain access to the crusader camp. Someone on this level must have a key to their cage. There's also a switch on the wall and giant spikes poised beneath the cage. If I kill the crusaders, I might be able to convince the camp guard that they were dead when I found them.~
@64444 = ~The Missing Patrol

My next task is to take the crusader leader's badge back to the crusader camp.

I found the missing crusader patrol and killed them by pulling a lever. The lever caused spikes to shoot up and impale all the crusaders in the cage. Gruesome. When I return to the crusader camp, I'll tell them that the cultists in this dungeon killed the crusaders. I should bring their leader's badge back with me as proof.~
@64445 = ~The Missing Patrol

I should return to the crusader camp to tell them I freed their missing patrol.

I found the missing crusader patrol and freed them. When I return to the crusader camp, I'll take credit for my act and hopefully gain access to the camp.~

I've found a way into the crusader camp.

I returned the dead leader's badge to the crusaders. I told them that the patrol died at the hands of the Cyricists and they believed me. I've been granted access to the crusader camp. Hopefully, from within I can find a way to end the siege against Bridgefort.~

Porios—

Gather all of your spare equipment in the supply room. We depart in two days. Since we put Sarevok's sword on the ship to Athkatla, a suspiciously high number of people have become aware of this location.

We must move quickly, before the Flaming Fist arrives. If fortune smiles upon us, we'll be in Zazesspur within the week.

@64675 = ~(This journal spans the last six months. Certain entries strike you as being important.)

S. and I had a long talk last night. Everything he says makes so much sense. I offered him my family crypt to use as a safehouse, and he accepted. The old motifs to the Dead Three seem particularly appropriate now. I often meditate by the symbol of Bhaal and think on his teachings, and on how his influence is returning to the land.

...

Today, S. mentioned that his plans are progressing quickly. He'll be gone for a week or two conducting research in an old tomb somewhere near Bridgefort. I lack his leadership capabilities, but I should be able to manage the followers while he's gone.

...

Last night, S. told me the groundwork has been laid for the next phase of his plan. He's moving into new quarters in the Iron Throne. I'll miss our talks, but I'm glad he's gaining the recognition he deserves. He'll change the face of the Sword Coast when he claims his birthright. All will know the power of Bhaal through him.

...

Received word that S. has been killed. I can scarcely believe it. I didn't think anyone could bring about his end. I don't know what to do next. For now, I'll keep the followers safe and stay away from the Flaming Fist.

...

The crusade's made it impossible to leave the city. There are guards at every gate thanks to the refugees flooding in. A hooded figure contacted me yesterday and offered a large sum of money if I could steal Sarevok's sword and deliver it to his agents in Athkatla. The money could be enough to bribe our way out of the city. I agreed. I had little choice.

...

With the help of my allies, we've stolen Sarevok's sword from the Ducal Palace. I wish I could keep it myself, but its sale will fund the safe escape of me and the others. Must be careful in how we store the blade for its trip to Waukeen's Promenade in Athkatla. Apparently, it's no good if the blood's wiped off.~
@64676 = ~Shortly after the crusade arrived, though, the wardstone disappeared, lost in the chaos of getting everyone into the fort. I witnessed a woman in a purple robe near where the wardstone was lost—likely a priest of Cyric.~

@64854 = ~My Missed Fortune

It seems my gold is lost to me.

I found the band of ruffians who robbed Ophyllis. They claimed to have taken my money in order to feed and shelter their fellow refugees. Though they had good intentions, I couldn't allow their illegal actions to go unchallenged. I convinced them to turn themselves in to the Flaming Fist.~

Once the property of dwarven cleric of Abbathor, Gurn Coldhearth, this mighty war hammer was infused with dark magics soon after Coldhearth's transformation into a lich.

Any hand that holds it soon grows cold and numb, but those strong enough to endure the discomfort will wield a weapon of formidable power.

@64980 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I need to find an old temple of Bhaal, and the wardstone that will allow me access to Bridgefort.

I encountered Jaheira the druid and her companion, Voghiln, on the way to Bridgefort. Jaheira reports that her husband, Khalid, is trapped within the besieged fort. To enter I need to find a wardstone stolen by a priestess of Cyric and taken to the ruins of a nearby temple of Bhaal.~
@64981 = ~The Bridgefort Wardstone~
@64982 = ~The Eyeless Priestess~
@64983 = ~The Eyeless Priestess

If I find a way to open her cell, I can decide whether to free Madele or leave her imprisoned.

I met a prisoner in the ruined temple of Bhaal. She claims she was a high priestess here over a decade ago, when Bhaal died. Captured by Cyricists, she's been imprisoned here ever since. If I can free her, she might regain some semblance of sanity and tell me more of Bhaal and his prophecies. Then again, perhaps it would be best for her to remain exactly where she is.~
@64984 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I need to find Ziatar and discover if she carries the wardstone.

A prisoner in the ruined temple told me that Ziatar, a priestess of Cyric, keeps watch over important items. Perhaps she has the wardstone I seek.~
@64985 = ~The Eyeless Priestess

I could find a way into the ritual chambers to learn what happened to high priestess Akanna.

It appears that the high priestess, Akanna, has locked herself in the ritual chambers and hasn't been seen for some time. There may be something even more sinister going on in these halls than a cult of Cyric.~
@64986 = ~The Eyeless Priestess

It seems Madele has been hearing a voice in her head.

According to Madele's disjointed notes, she's been hearing a voice in her head. The voice tells her that her time of suffering will soon be over and Akanna will lose her place as high priestess of Cyric. Is this a symptom of her madness or something more, I wonder?~
@64987 = ~The Eyeless Priestess

I must find this temple's leader if I'm to learn what's happening here.

Creatures have attacked the temple of Cyric. A priest screamed that monsters were killing everyone. I should proceed with caution.~
@64988 = ~The Eyeless Priestess

When I proceed to the reliquary, I can find and defeat the monster who has taken over the temple.

Akanna reported hearing a voice in her mind that made her let horrible monsters into the temple. She indicated the creature responsible for overwhelming her mind is further in the temple, in the reliquary.~
@64989 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I can use the teleport circle east of Bridgefort to enter the fort.

I located the wardstone needed to enter Bridgefort. There's a teleport circle to the east of the fort, and once I enter it with the stone I should be magically teleported into Bridgefort.~
@64990 = ~The Eyeless Priestess

I discovered a mind flayer was behind the strange events at the temple of Cyric.

I discovered the mastermind behind the summoning of the tentacled beast. It was a mind flayer who read the mind of the caged priestess of Bhaal. She wanted to see an end to this temple, so she allowed the mind flayer to read her thoughts and learn everything about the layout and cultists here. The creature then usurped the mind of the high priestess and forced her to let its minions into the temple. I put an end to those plans.~

@65016 = ~Ilmater, the Lord on the Rack, has gifted me with the ability to rejuvenate the injured. I can restore you and your friend's bodies, minds, and spirits as effectively as a good night's rest—but to do so carries a great cost.~
@65017 = ~The Broken God Ilmater has gifted me with the ability to rejuvenate the injured. I can restore your body, mind, and spirit as effectively as a good night's rest—but it comes at a cost.~
@65018 = ~Each time I restore you, I will be draining my own life energy, and that energy shall never be replenished. If I rejuvenate you too often, I'll die. I don't know exactly how much energy it will use—I think I can rejuvenate you at least twice. Take care how you use the Crying God's gift.~
@65019 = ~I understand the risk to you, and I thank you. Rejuvenate me now.~

@65028 = ~Ilmater, hear me, thy loyal servant... As I take another's suffering and sacrifice of myself that they may live, I pray thou dost give me strength to persevere.~
@65029 = ~O Ilmater, save thy poor servant... That took so much, <CHARNAME>. Should you need my help again, I fear I'll not live to see Caelar's fall.~
@65030 = ~I must gather my energies. Leave me to endure this pain until you have need of me again.~
@65031 = ~I have given all I have, <CHARNAME>. I pray it is enough to see you through. For myself, I go now to my Crying God. Ilmater, take me from this world of suffering, bring thy loyal servant home to thee! Ooohhh...~
@65032 = ~Of course. I'll assist however I can.~
@65033 = ~I'm not so desperate for healing that I'd see you drain your own life essence.~
@65034 = ~Only if I want to not die.~
@65035 = ~If I need healing I'll tell you. Now be silent.~
@65036 = ~If that should change, be sure to seek me out. I'm here if you need me.~
@65037 = ~As you wish. Remember, I am here if you need me.~
@65038 = ~Ugh, smells like moldy bones down here.~ [BD65038]

@65046 = ~I heard th-that Sarevok's sword has disap-p-peared from the Ducal Palace. Could it be the b-blade of which he s-speaks?~
@65047 = ~I've said too much. All you need know is that naught but death awaits you here. Turn back now, while you still can.~ [BD65047]
@65048 = ~The sentry that spoke to me mentioned a "sword" that was "already gone."~
@65049 = ~I'm thinking about what that sentry said. About the "sword" being "gone."~
@65050 = ~What can you tell me about this place?~
@65051 = ~How have you been doing these last few weeks?~
@65052 = ~I require healing.~
@65053 = ~Nothing right now. Let's continue on.~
@65054 = ~I have another question for you.~
@65055 = ~Let's continue on.~
@65056 = ~I saw you earlier, yelling at me across the chasm. You mentioned a sword you thought I was looking for. What sword?~
@65057 = ~Sarevok's sword. We stole the blade from the Ducal Palace, but you killed the man—I thought you might claim it as your own.~ [BD65057]
@65058 = ~Why did you steal the sword?~
@65059 = ~I do lay claim to it. I put an end to Sarevok—his blade is mine by right. Why did YOU want it?~
@65060 = ~That's enough talk. The Flaming Fist waits outside. Present yourselves to them for arrest.~
@65061 = ~Korlasz ordered us to. She had a buyer who offered her a ton of money for it. Enough to smuggle us all out of the city. That's all I know.~
@65062 = ~Very well. The Flaming Fist waits outside. Present yourselves to them for arrest.~
@65063 = ~I kinda saw a note on Duke Jannath's desk—it fell on the floor, and I, I just picked it up, honest! It said someone broke into the palace and took Sarevok's sword. Could that be it?~ [BD65063]
@65064 = ~Perhaps. But why would she be interested in it?~
@65065 = ~That might explain why the sentry thought I'd come after the sword. It was in my half-brother's hand the last time I saw it.~
@65066 = ~He said it was "gone," though.~
@65067 = ~Items that belonged to powerful individuals can develop unique powers of their own. I mistrust any who would seek out such a dark artifact.~
@65068 = ~I don't know why Korlasz would take the sword, but if it's "gone," she must have given it to someone else. Maybe we can find a record or shipping log in her chambers.~ [BD65068]
@65069 = ~It's worth looking into.~
@65070 = ~We'll not find answers staring at this dusty floor. Let's keep moving.~
@65071 = ~All I care about is completing the mission and getting out of here.~
@65072 = ~Sure, what's on your mind?~ [BD65072]
@65073 = ~Everyone steals for a reason. Even if it's just the thrill.~ [BD65073]
@65074 = ~This glowing crystal structure stands atop an altar, filling the room with an eerie light. ~
@65075 = ~We are defeated? How—how is this possible? ~
@65076 = ~We are being tested!~
@65077 = ~Quickly, destroy the bridge so none can follow.~
@65078 = ~<CHARNAME>! Corporal Duncan sent me. The crusade's falling back, but they're placing barrels like those that destroyed Coast Way crossing along Boareskyr Bridge!~
@65079 = ~There are far more barrels, as this bridge is so much bigger, but they'll take longer to detonate because of that.~
@65080 = ~They kept us from crossing the Winding Water once. Odds are they'll try to do it again. We can't let that happen.~ [BD65080]
@65081 = ~If that bridge blows, we'll never reach Dragonspear Castle in time.~
@65082 = ~You need to head west, quickly. Stop the crusade before they obliterate our only way over the Winding Water!~
@65083 = ~The Battle for Bridgefort

I must save Boareskyr Bridge from destruction at the hands of the crusade.

Though the forces Caelar dispatched to subdue Bridgefort have been defeated, the crusade remains a threat. Powerful magic is being harnessed on Boareskyr Bridge. I must go there and thwart the crusaders in whatever they plan, lest they cut off our last viable route across the Winding Water.~
@65084 = ~It looks as if you've saved Boareskyr Bridge from sharing the same fate as Coast Way Crossing. Well done.~
@65085 = ~Oi! Mind your tongue.~
@65086 = ~Let it go, Marnard. <CHARNAME>, join me in the crusader's siege camp as soon as possible. The sooner we've crossed the Winding Water, the happier I'll be.~
@65087 = ~Not everyone's a hero, <CHARNAME>. But everyone plays their part as best they can. At least try to act like you respect that.~
@65088 = ~Respect is earned by deeds, mercenary. Aspirations are for children and failures—I'll not waste my time coddling either.~
@65089 = ~Join me in the crusader's siege camp as soon as you can. The sooner we've crossed the Winding Water, the happier I'll be.~
@65090 = ~Even if that were t-true, there was a LOT that needed d-doing here.~
@65091 = ~What wouldst thou have us do now?~
@65092 = ~<CHARNAME>!~
@65093 = ~Tell me, were things here interesting? Things at camp were dull, dull, dull. Corporal Duncan absolutely refused to let me out of it.~ [BD65093]
@65094 = ~I'm certain he just seeks to protect you. None of us want to see the Flaming Fist's most valuable new recruit endangered.~
@65095 = ~I'm surprised he can stop you.~
@65096 = ~You chose the mercenary life. Live with that choice, and do so in silence.~
@65097 = ~Men will never give a lady her due. If you desire something, I recommend taking it first and asking permission later, if you really must ask permission at all.~ [BD65097]
@65098 = ~For the love of the gods, don't encourage her. Listen, recruit, you're a Flaming Fist now. You do as your commander tells you, and you do it without complaint. You DEFINITELY don't complain in front of him. Got it?~ [BD65098]
@65099 = ~I suppose I did ask for this, didn't I?~ [BD65099]
@65100 = ~If you could see your way clear to not encourage insubordination in the ranks, I'd appreciate it.~ [BD65100]
@65101 = ~Thank you, Captain.~ [BD65101]
@65102 = ~Thank you for that, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps now I'll get some peace.~ [BD65102]
@65103 = ~I'm sorry, Corporal Duncan. Did you just say something?~ [BD65103]
@65104 = ~...No. I didn't say anything, recruit.~ [BD65104]
@65105 = ~We've done well here, <CHARNAME>. Hopefully, our luck holds until we reach Dragonspear.~ [BD65105]
@65106 = ~I'm not happy with the way things played out at Bridgefort, <CHARNAME>. But what's done is done. We need to get back on the road to Dragonspear.~ [BD65106]
@65107 = ~Lead the way across the bridge. The rest of us will follow.~ [BD65107]
@65108 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I can cross the bridge and proceed to Dragonspear Castle.

With the Shining Lady's minions retreating and the threat to Boareskyr Bridge ended, the Flaming Fist caravan is free to proceed north to Dragonspear and our final confrontation with Caelar Argent. I must lead the way, and the caravan will follow.~
@65109 = ~Hey, it's <CHARNAME>! Heard about what you did here—I'm glad you're on our side.~
@65110 = ~I did nothing you wouldn't have, given the opportunity.~
@65111 = ~What are you doing?~
@65112 = ~I'd be glad to have me on my side too.~
@65113 = ~You presume too much, mercenary.~
@65114 = ~See how modest the hero is. Fate gives you opportunity, but heroes make the most of it. You are lucky, <CHARNAME>. Voghiln is here to frame your heroism properly, in such a way that your name will echo down through history!~ [BD65114]
@65115 = ~I'd be glad to have you on most of my sides. The view from my left isn't the best... I like to think it helps people appreciate the rest of me, though.~ [BD65115]
@65116 = ~You monkeys run this way and that. The astute ignore the feces-flinging and pursues their own goals using the best means available.~
@65117 = ~First Bridgefort, next Dragonspear. The Shining Lady will rue the day she heard your name. But I can't talk now.~
@65118 = ~Forgive me, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I meant no disrespect, I assure you.~
@65119 = ~I gotta get these barrels ready for transport to Dragonspear. Hate to be rude, but Corporal Duncan'll have my hide if he sees me lollygagging with the hero, so I'm gonna haveta just say good day to you.~
@65120 = ~Can't talk now, sorry—gotta get these barrels ready to go.~
@65121 = ~The intruders' weapons were poisoned, but Tymora smiled upon us—the poison was weak, and fatal only to the weakest of victims. Imoen's heart beats much stronger than that.~ [BD65121]
@65122 = ~Use your brains, both of you. We can't agree to this. The reports from Baldur's Gate said someone paid for the hero's blood on a sword. Now Caelar wants the hero under her control. I don't like it.~ [BD65122]
@65123 = ~The blood of the divine runs through our friend's veins. Her body itself is a source of power.~ [BD65123]
@65124 = ~Someone in Baldur's Gate paid for the Bhaalspawn's blood? Why? Hephernaan, what can this mean?~ [BD65124]
@65125 = ~Calm yourself, my lady. It is likely a coincidence, unrelated to our plans. Appeal to the child of Bhaal. Make him understand the importance of cooperation.~ [BD65125]
@65126 = ~So be it. Everyone, back to camp. Prepare for an attack.~ [BD65126]
@65127 = ~May Tymora favor us.~ [BD65127]
@65128 = ~I... I agree with de Lancie.~ [BD65128]
@65129 = ~You what?~ [BD65129]
@65130 = ~Oh, don't waggle your finger at me, Nederlok. You've got troops to spare. My militia's fifty souls strong, and I know them all by name. I know their families. Daggerford answered the call, but do any of you care about us? The hells you do.~ [BD65130]
@65131 = ~Surrender is a tool, one I won't use until I'm certain of the outcome. I stay with the coalition.~
@65132 = ~...~
@65133 = ~Wait—someone is here. You are not alone.~ [BD65133]
@65134 = ~That's impossible. Mercenaries are not allowed in the castle, and no crusader would dare trespass in my personal chambers.~ [BD65134]
@65135 = ~Hm, no crusader, and no mercenary, either. The Bhaalspawn is within reach at last. Bring me their blood!~ [BD65135]
@65136 = ~You—here? Impossible! I wove the courtyard wards myself! You couldn't have— Ah. Of course. You learned of the underground river and made good use of it. Impressive.~ [BD65136]

@65153 = ~I'd have you come with me. What do you say?~
@65154 = ~These things do nothing but drag you down. Think of all you could accomplish at my side.~
@65155 = ~You don't know me at all, do you? On your knees, hands behind your head. Let's go.~ [BD65155]
@65156 = ~Innocence, HAH! We were THERE, <CHARNAME>. You can't lie to us.~ [BD65156]
@65157 = ~You've earned your fate. We were fools to bring the child of Bhaal amongst us. Skie Silvershield paid for it with her life. You will pay with yours.~ [BD65157]
@65158 = ~We know who murdered the girl. We were there.~
@65159 = ~This is bigger than us, <CHARNAME>. Bigger than the Flaming Fist, or even my family. You don't know what's happening up above... Skie's murder—at the hand of Sarevok Anchev's sibling, no less—has thrown Baldur's Gate into turmoil.~ [BD65159]
@65160 = ~What I believe doesn't matter. All that matters is Baldur's Gate. What's happening can't be allowed to go on.~ [BD65160]

@65164 = ~Captain, what are you doing...?~ [BD65164]

@65171 = ~Important Events

Secure the western bridge.

The Battle for Bridgefort is won and the crusaders driven off. The western bridge remains open for the time being, and I must ensure it remains so. The Flaming Fist need that bridge to reach Dragonspear Castle.~
@65172 = ~It is good to see a friendly face in the wilderness.~ [BD65172]
@65173 = ~Rasaad? What are you doing out here?~
@65174 = ~I recognize you. You're the monk who worked at the Iron Throne, tending to refugees.~
@65175 = ~Don't consider me a friend yet. State your business.~
@65176 = ~I heard of the Flaming Fist's march north, and I desire to join. I believe our paths may converge for a time. I left the city and have been traveling north, hoping to catch up with you. It seems I have accomplished my goal.~ [BD65176]
@65177 = ~Yes, I require your aid. Join me.~
@65178 = ~I don't need your help at the moment, but I might later. Wait in camp for me, and I'll call on you when I need you.~
@65179 = ~You made your choice back in the Gate, monk. Begone.~
@65180 = ~Thank you. Let us be on our way.~ [BD65180]
@65181 = ~Unexpected Allies

Rasaad now travels with me.

The monk Rasaad has joined my cause. I have a feeling I'll need all the help I can get. If I dismiss Rasaad, he'll wait for me at the Flaming Fist camp.~
@65182 = ~Unexpected Allies

Rasaad waits at the Flaming Fist camp.

The monk Rasaad has followed the Flaming Fist all the way here. He claims he wishes to help. If I require his assistance, he'll be waiting for me at the Flaming Fist camp.~
@65183 = ~It Wasn't Me

I have one chance to escape—by going over the waterfall.

Corwin is dead, but more Flaming Fist mercenaries will surely follow. The longer I remain in the sewers, the greater the danger I'll find myself in. To escape, I must go over the edge of the falls.~
@65184 = ~It Wasn't Me

I have one chance to escape—by going over the waterfall.

Bence Duncan and his followers have been slain, but more Flaming Fist mercenaries will surely follow. The longer I remain in the sewers, the greater the danger I'll find myself in. To escape, I must go over the edge of the falls.~
@65185 = ~Shadow Thief~
@65186 = ~The Coast Way bridge is to the northeast! Wolves and goblins spotted in the western woods! Refugees near a burned-out inn up the path!~
@65187 = ~Excellent report. I have a mission for you.~
@65188 = ~Carry on, then.~
@65189 = ~You there! You look like someone who appreciates the finer things in life.~
@65190 = ~Looking for something a little different, a little dangerous, a little unique...?~
@65191 = ~I ask you, what good is gold if you won't spend it on fine items I offer?~
@65192 = ~If family means nothing to you, tell me of Korlasz and her lineage.~
@65193 = ~Arcana runs in our blood. In life, we worshipped the Dead Three. Ours is a line of wizards, of necromancers whose magic transcends death. From one generation to the next, we have studied the mechanism of undeath. Those who lie here lacked the skill, power, or will to live eternally as liches.~ [BD65193]
@65194 = ~I see. I will restore peace to this place for you, that you may rest once more.~
@65195 = ~Well, that's... unsettling, but I suppose that should be no surprise. I'll return to you when Korlasz is gone.~
@65196 = ~Your "eternal" life nears its end—an end that shall come at my hand.~
@65197 = ~If you're interred here, you must be one of Korlasz's ancestors. Do you know anything about her?~
@65198 = ~Korlasz... I know the name. Her mother was a wizard, her father a priest of Bhaal. When Bhaal died, she turned her worship to his former ally, Loviatar. Her faith focuses on the return of Bhaal, though... She serves the Maiden of Pain only in the interim.~
@65199 = ~Thanks for the information. I shall find your staff, spirit, that you may rest again.~
@65200 = ~I understand. I'm leaving now.~
@65201 = ~I appreciate the information. Now die.~
@65202 = ~Did you not hear the people playing cards at that table too? They left recently, by the looks of it. You're one of Korlasz's followers, aren't you? Tell me the truth, now.~
@65203 = ~I don't trust you, and I suspect you're really an ally of those who operate out of this tomb. I've no choice but to kill you.~
@65204 = ~No! Aaah!~
@65205 = ~Now what do I do?~
@65206 = ~The moss must be down here somewhere.~
@65207 = ~If only I could complete this formula!~
@65208 = ~If it's not too much trouble, I've another question for you.~ [BD65208]
@65209 = ~No trouble at all. Ask away.~
@65210 = ~I suppose that's what I get for answering the last one.~
@65211 = ~Do you truly think this an appropriate time to be asking questions of me? Be silent, fool.~
@65212 = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>, I'm just—it's not every day I get to speak with the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@65213 = ~You have another question, I take it? Let's hear it then.~
@65214 = ~Nor is it every day the hero of Baldur's Gate gets to ignore you, which will happen soon if you don't ask your damn question.~
@65215 = ~If that day has ever been, it is ended now. Be silent; I've important matters to attend to.~
@65216 = ~Would it be too rude to ask you yet another question?~ [BD65216]
@65217 = ~Ask it.~
@65218 = ~No ruder than the last handful. What is it?~
@65219 = ~No, but what I will do to you should you ask another question will be very rude indeed.~
@65220 = ~A man in a hood, you say? I wonder why he cares about your safety... No matter. I must press on.~
@65221 = ~Korlasz is defeated, and with her, the last of Sarevok's influence. Your foster father, Gorion, has been avenged. A time of peace seems at hand.

Still, you can't help but hear the rumors. The people of Baldur's Gate whisper that you share the same dark blood as Sarevok. Some hint you killed your half-brother not for the good of the city, but so you could take his place and his power.

These rumors, however, pale in comparison to the tales of the crusade growing in the north. Every day, more refugees arrive at the city gates, speaking of being driven from their homes and telling of others who were conscripted into the army's ranks.

A tenday after Korlasz's defeat, you retire to your room in the Ducal Palace, your thoughts troubled. You wonder what effect this crusade will have on Baldur's Gate, little knowing how close at hand the answer is...~ [BD65221]
@65222 = ~Spells Remaining~
@65223 = ~You think I would have you be something more than an ally in the battle against Caelar? You flatter yourself, <CHARNAME>.~

@65344 = ~Drawn to the clamor of the forge at an early age, you became quite skilled supplying the smiths and monks of Candlekeep with whatever tools they occasionally required. But, inspired by your foster father, Gorion's, tales of ironclad heroes, your preference was to swing a blade rather than craft it. One of the Watchers was kind enough to take you under her wing, training you in the basics of the deadly arts. These lessons served you well when you left the keep, ultimately allowing you to avenge Gorion's murder by your half-brother Sarevok Anchev and become the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@65345 = ~Long did you marvel at the tales your foster father, Gorion, read to you from the various holy books housed in your childhood home of Candlekeep. The strength and power of faith inspired you, but the petty squabbles of the gods only filled you with disdain. From this you came to understand the monks of the keep and the nature of their beliefs. Some of the brethren, perhaps responding to Gorion's subtle urging, graciously answered your many questions, teaching you much about the meaning and role of the priesthood. These lessons served you well in the world beyond Candlekeep's walls. With body and soul under attack by Gorion's murderer, your half-brother Sarevok Anchev, your faith and skills kept you alive, transforming you from a simple cleric into the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@65346 = ~Inspired by your foster father Gorion's tales of adventure amidst the barrens, hills, and forests of Faerûn, you learned to appreciate the power and challenges of the wilderness. Though your youth was spent within the walls of Candlekeep, you were a welcome and frequent visitor to its stables and pens. Much of your time was spent atop the great towers of the citadel, where birds sought shelter from both predators and the chill of the ocean winds. You yearned to journey into the meadows and forests you beheld from your lofty perch, but you could not have dreamed of what awaited you there. When Gorion was murdered by your half-brother Sarevok Anchev, you were bound by Candlekeep's walls no longer. You ventured forth to avenge you foster father, and in so doing, you became the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@65347 = ~Inspired by your foster father Gorion's tales of chivalry and honor, from a young age you committed yourself to pursue good and punish evil. There was little opportunity for you to engage in such things inside the walls of your childhood home of Candlekeep, with its population of staid and humble monks and those that served them. The peace of your surroundings should have been comforting; instead, you found it stifling. Gorion's murder at the hands of your half-brother Sarevok Anchev took you into the world beyond Candlekeep. And it was only beyond Candlekeep that you could realize your destiny: slaying Sarevok, avenging your foster father, and becoming the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@65348 = ~Though your foster father, Gorion, tried to guide you to virtue, you were always drawn to the power of evil. Uninterested in spellbooks or divine knowledge, you begged the Watchers of your childhood home, Candlekeep, to teach you the deadly art of martial combat. Though initially willing to help, each teacher grew uneasy about the growing darkness within you and eventually turned you away. This had little effect on you; you simply cast the weaklings aside and moved on. Your lust for power eventually brought you to a forbidden tome deep within Candlekeep, a tome that put you in contact with an evil outsider. In exchange for dark power, you agreed for that outsider to become your patron. When Gorion was murdered by your half-brother Sarevok Anchev, you finally left the confines of Candlekeep. Freed to act, you left a trail of corpses in your wake as you clawed your way towards ever greater power and the unofficial but nevertheless influential title of hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@65349 = ~Though your childhood was spent within the carefully ordered walls of Candlekeep, you were always fascinated by your foster father Gorion's tales of the unspoiled wilderness. When Gorion was slain by your half-brother Sarevok Anchev, you were freed to explore nature more freely. Your worship of the Earthmother blessed you with many gifts that allowed you to survive the trials that followed. Without her, you could never have slain Sarevok, avenging Gorion's death and becoming the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@65350 = ~Inspired by your foster father Gorion's knowledge of the magical arts, you made especially productive use of your library home of Candlekeep. You pored over its vast treasury of magical lore, absorbing as much arcane knowledge as you could. Gorion instructed you in magical basics, but his concern for your safety impeded your progress. It was only after he was slain by your half-brother Sarevok Anchev and you moved beyond the walls of Candlekeep that you began to realize your potential. Your growing power and skill let you slay Sarevok and become the hero of Baldur's Gate, but in your heart you remain a student of magic, always seeking to expand your knowledge and with it, your power.~
@65351 = ~Your foster father Gorion was a fount of knowledge regarding the magical arts. But it wasn't his knowledge you admired—it was his abilities. Uninterested in a structured study of the arcane, you chose instead to harness raw magic, attempting to duplicate the effects of Gorion's spells. Your foster father was never entirely comfortable with this approach. Perhaps if he'd been able to see all that you've accomplished since his death, his mind would have been changed. In avenging him and slaying his murderer, your half-brother Sarevok Anchev, you became the hero of Baldur's Gate, but more, you proved that the path you chose to realize your mystical power was the correct one.~
@65352 = ~Thanks to your foster father Gorion's colorful tales of rogues and scoundrels, you spent your childhood yearning for intrigue. Nimble fingers and a casual attitude towards personal property frequently caused trouble in your childhood home of Candlekeep. It was only when Gorion was slain by your half-brother Sarevok Anchev and you moved into the world beyond the keep's walls that you were able to utilize your natural talents to their full extent. Sarevok died at your hand; your foster father is avenged, and you are celebrated as the hero of Baldur's Gate, enjoying a life of luxury you could barely imagine inside Candlekeep. The future is yours for the taking... like a fat purse dangling from a noble's belt.~
@65353 = ~As a child, you were enraptured by your foster father Gorion's countless tales of romance and adventure, though less for the content than the art of the telling. Yours was a world defined by the books collected in your childhood home of Candlekeep. You immersed yourself in ancient legends and endless lore, developing a natural talent for showmanship. It was only after Gorion's murder at the hands of your half-brother Sarevok Anchev that you and your talents were exposed to the wider world beyond Candlekeep. You avenged Gorion, and you did so with a flair and panache that caused the people of Baldur's Gate to celebrate you as their hero.~
@65354 = ~Your youth was shaped by two major influences: your foster father Gorion and Hemma, a monk in service to Shar who spent several years in Candlekeep. While Gorion attempted to cultivate your intelligence and kindness, Hemma secretly taught you the ways of the dark goddess, fostering strength and discipline while hardening your heart. After Hemma died, you adopted her ways as your own. When Gorion was slain by your half-brother Sarevok Anchev, you were freed to pursue your own destiny. You thought you would find it in the shadows. You were wrong. When Sarevok was slain at your hand, you gained prominence as "the hero of Baldur's Gate."~
@65355 = ~Your youth was shaped by two major influences: your foster father Gorion and a trio of Sun Soul monks in service to Lathander who spent several years within Candlekeep. While Gorion endeavored to cultivate your intelligence and kindness, the Morninglord's worshippers fostered wisdom and discipline within you. After the three monks departed Candlekeep, you adopted their ways as your own and can now rightfully call yourself a monk of the Sun Soul. But it was only after your half-brother Sarevok Anchev's murder of Gorion that you were able to pursue spiritual wisdom beyond Candlekeep's walls. Your path brought you inevitably into conflict with Sarevok, who was slain at your hand. This act transformed you. No longer a simple monk of the Sun Soul order, you became a champion of the people: the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@65356 = ~Your youth was shaped by two major influences: your foster father Gorion and a group of monks in service to Bahamut who spent several years within your home of Candlekeep. While Gorion attempted to cultivate your intelligence and kindness, the monks fostered your wisdom and discipline. After they departed, you adopted their ways as your own, but it was only after Gorion's murder at the hands of your half-brother Sarevok Anchev that you were able to pursue spiritual wisdom in the world beyond Candlekeep's walls. Your path brought you inevitably into conflict with Sarevok, who was slain at your hand. This act transformed you from a humble monk into a champion of the people, the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@65357 = ~Yours has always been a wild spirit, a fact that often frustrated your foster father, Gorion. Books held no interest for you, nor did disciplined combat. Gorion spent years wondering what to do with you, until the fateful day an Uthgardt barbarian from Icewind Dale delivered an ancient scroll to your childhood home, Candlekeep. Though her stay was brief, the barbarian had a deep impact upon you. She taught you the ways of her people: how to connection to spirits of nature and unleash wild rages. After she left, you found Candlekeep intolerably stifling. It was only after Gorion's death at the hands of your half-brother Sarevok Anchev that you were able to fully explore your proclivities. You did not know that avenging Gorion and slaying Sarevok would make you the hero of Baldur's Gate. It happened nevertheless, and it's up to you to take advantage.~
@65358 = ~As a child, your sightings of invisible creatures and spirits greatly concerned your foster father, Gorion. It was only after the shaman of an Uthgardt barbarian tribe from Icewind Dale delivered an ancient scroll to Candlekeep that your abilities' true nature became known. He performed the initiation ceremony that was the first step on the spirit path towards becoming a shaman. When Gorion was slain by your half-brother Sarevok Anchev, you left Candlekeep anxious to further strengthen your ties to the ghost realms. Your power grew, as did Sarevok's; the confrontation between you was perhaps inevitable. Gorion was avenged, Sarevok slain at your hand, and you became the hero of Baldur's Gate. But though the city and its people celebrate your name, your attention is forever divided between the physical world and the invisible, spiritual one that exists alongside it.~
@65359 = ~After years spent in ignorance, you now know something of your heritage, but little of your mother. Over the years, you gleaned something of her tale from vague allusions and words Gorion sometimes uttered in tear-filled sleep. She was a human from Silverymoon and a friend of his for many seasons. Over time, you came to believe that she died giving birth to you. Knowing what you now know—that your father is none other than the dead god Bhaal, Lord of Murder—this might be for the best.~

@65473 = ~Well, someone thinks highly o' themself, don't they? Ye're no the only one fightin' the crusade, "hero."~
@65474 = ~Think ye're better than me, do ye? Oh, it's yer lucky day, y'puffed up clodpate. If we wuzn't goin' t'face the crusade t'gether, I'd knock yer face outta the back o' yer head. Now get outta MY face... before I change my mind.~ [BD65474]
@65475 = ~Hat~
@65476 = ~This soft cap looks neither durable nor practical. Its stylish appearance marks it as strictly decorative.~
@65477 = ~Hey, what be all that noise upstairs?~ [BD65477]
@65478 = ~Yeah, sounded like big fight!~ [BD65478]
@65479 = ~Belben and I had a little disagreement, but it's all handled now. Nothing to worry about.~
@65480 = ~I was clumsy and knocked over a shelf in the storage room, that's all.~
@65481 = ~It was indeed a big fight, and another one's about to happen right now.~
@65482 = ~Oh, that make sense. Go on past.~ [BD65482]

@65485 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

Using these gloves, I will be able to climb up to Dragonspear's basement.

I killed two ogres manning a lift up to Dragonspear Castle's basement. One had a pair of gloves which will allow me to climb the greased ropes used to raise the platform. Once I don the gloves, I can use the ropes to reach the Dragonspear's lowest level.~
@65486 = ~Jaheira, friend of your foster father Gorion. He bid me and my husband, Khalid, to watch over you. I know your story well.~
@65487 = ~Well met indeed. I must go now. Perhaps we will speak again later.~
@65488 = ~Perhaps we'll meet later on the road, then. For now I must go.~
@65489 = ~I can't take you with me at the moment, but we'll meet again, I'm sure. Until then, take care.~
@65490 = ~Enough of this nonsense. Cut 'em down!~
@65491 = ~The Shining Lady embraces all who claim her cause as their own—but I cannot allow you entry. You'd not be the first of our foes to attempt to enter the castle in the guise of the faithful.~

@65493 = ~Why would I? You on a wanted poster or somethin'? Heh, those sketches are so bad you wouldn't recognize yer mum. Now who are you?~
@65494 = ~Your friend needs rest now. I doubt you could wake her even if you tried, but it would be best for all if you didn't try. Leave us now.~
@65495 = ~I didn't love Skie Silvershield, and I'm not so foolish as to think she loved me. But I did like her. She deserved better than what she got from you.~ [BD65495]
@65496 = ~That sort of bravado might have served the hero of Baldur's Gate well, <CHARNAME>. But we both know you are no hero. It will gain you nothing now.~ [BD65496]
@65497 = ~You had me fooled, <CHARNAME>. I'll admit it now, though it pains me to do so. Like so many here in Baldur's Gate, it seemed to me you truly were a hero, in thought, word, and deed.~ [BD65497]
@65498 = ~I should have known better. There are no heroes, not in this world. You've taught me a valuable lesson, one I'll not forget soon.~ [BD65498]
@65499 = ~You've only yourself to blame, fiend. I watched you closely, the weeks we traveled together. I saw you court darkness and sow the seeds of fear and despair in those around you. Now you will reap the harvest of your own iniquity.~ [BD65499]
@65500 = ~You don't get relief, <CHARNAME>. Not after what you did.~ [BD65500]

@65502 = ~And I shall need no help in killing you.~
@65503 = ~I'll lose sleep over that, I will. But what's done is done and I'd do it again if I had the chance. That gold may cost us our lives, but our lives would have been lost already without it. So do what you must. Kill us if you want.~
@65504 = ~Rabble-Rousers

@65515 = ~You've seen nothing like this, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. These are the famous Black Pits, run by the one, the only, Baeloth the Entertainer! Deadly matches between wild animals three times an hour!~
@65516 = ~Perhaps I'll take a look.~
@65517 = ~You make it sound spectacular, but words cost less than lives. Is the show really as good as you say? Be honest.~
@65518 = ~That's three times an hour more than I care to witness.~
@65519 = ~Nothing like this, I assure you! At the Black Pits, you'll witness deadly matches the likes of which you could never imagine! 'Tis the finest entertainment the Sword Coast has to offer!~ [BD65519]
@65520 = ~Sounds interesting. I'll take a peek. Where can I find this most awe-inspiring of spectacles?~
@65521 = ~It sounds amazing, but words cost less than lives. Is the show really as good as you say? Be honest.~
@65522 = ~Such tawdry distractions hold no interest for me.~
@65523 = ~Tawdry? Perish the thought! These are the famous Black Pits! Deadly matches 'twixt ferocious beasts run three times an hour, each more spectacular and bloody than the last! One will be starting soon. Just head up the path.~ [BD65523]
@65524 = ~Well... to be honest, I'm only doing this job to feed my family. I lost everything to the crusade. Baeloth slips me a few extra coppers not to let on how bad the show really is.~ [BD65524]
@65525 = ~I appreciate your honesty. I'll take a look regardless.~
@65526 = ~I'm sorry such misfortune has befallen you. Here, take these 10 gold pieces. It's not much, but it should help you feed your family for a time.~
@65527 = ~I had a feeling. Everyone's got an angle.~
@65528 = ~Deceit and lies. I suppose I should expect nothing more, at this point.~

Fearsome wild animals battle for supremacy! What will emerge the victor? 

The ferocious WOLVERINE?
The brawling BLACK BEAR?
The slithering BASILISK?
Or perhaps the aggressive ANKHEG?

Come see the greatest battles of our age and place your bets on which creature will emerge from the pit... ALIVE.~

@65541 = ~You saved Bridgefort from the crusade. You saved us all from Caelar! Why did you do this? How could you do this?~
@65542 = ~On Boareskyr Bridge you were claimed by Bhaal! The Lord of Murder lives on in you!~
@65543 = ~Abomination! The stones of Boareskyr are scarred with the truth! We revered an heir of Bhaal and damned ourselves in the doing!~
@65544 = ~Like you, I am a shaman. Your mastery of the spirits is impressive, especially for one of your kind.~
@65545 = ~One of my kind. Even you, one who knows the ghost dance, who walks the spirit path, even you look at me and see nothing but a goblin.~ [BD65545]
@65546 = ~Forgive me. I meant no offense.~

@65555 = ~There will be no rodent fighting while Minsc is around, I can tell you that much.~ [BD65555]
@65556 = ~Asking questions always gets me in trouble. Not gonna stop. Tried. Didn't work. I'll come with you, though. Not safe to be alone these days.~ [BD65556]

@65561 = ~Then I fear we've a long day ahead of us. What remains to be done?~
@65562 = ~Caelar won't be chained, de Lancie. She will be victorious, or she will be dead.~
@65563 = ~Corporal Duncan led a team of soldiers into the keep. It is the only avenue left for her to flee. Fortunately, our mages have already warded the exit to the underground caverns you discovered.~ [BD65563]
@65564 = ~She doesn't strike me as someone who would run.~
@65565 = ~Do you really think she'll try to escape? She seems more a "die in a final blaze of glory" sort, don't you think?~
@65566 = ~I should go add my magic to theirs, if you truly believe she'll try to escape through the caverns.~
@65567 = ~Then she is trapped. Excellent. I would see an end to this.~
@65568 = ~Nothing turns a person into a coward faster than a defeat.~ [BD65568]
@65569 = ~If Caelar's not trying to flee, then we have her cornered. My troops are securing the courtyard while the Flaming Fist move into the castle.~ [BD65569]
@65570 = ~There is no way for her to snatch victory from the defeat we've handed her this day. The crusade is at an end.~ [BD65570]
@65571 = ~I believe Corporal Duncan is looking for Caelar himself. Best hurry if you want to catch him.~ [BD65571]
@65572 = ~How do I get into the castle?~
@65573 = ~What can you tell me about the castle defenses?~
@65574 = ~While you hang back, as you did during the siege. Your cowardice disgusts me.~

@65576 = ~The front door is covered in rubble, but there is an entrance on the roof. You can find the Daggerford forces there.~ [BD65576]
@65577 = ~Find Caelar and do what must be done. I'll see to it the rest of the castle is secured and the crusaders rounded up. Now go!~ [BD65577]
@65578 = ~All I know is the outer entrances are blocked by rubble, but our forces seem to have found a way in through the roof.~ [BD65578]
@65579 = ~The mages can hold the entrance. You have a more important task ahead of you.~
@65580 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I need to find a way into Dragonspear Castle through the roof.

Caelar may be trapped within Dragonspear Castle. I shall go seek her, and a final end to this conflict, there. The entrance to the castle lies on the roof.~
@65581 = ~We have them on the run now!~
@65582 = ~Good to see you again, <CHARNAME>. We're holding the entrance to the tunnels and making sure any crusaders coming back this way are captured or killed.~ [BD65582]
@65583 = ~I discovered some soldiers taking advantage of their position. They're looting all the valuables they find on this level.~
@65584 = ~What should I do?~
@65585 = ~Keep at it, then.~
@65586 = ~I've no time for this.~
@65587 = ~Gods damn it, the battle's not even won yet...! Officer Granz, take care of this, please.~ [BD65587]

@65604 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I must find Bence Duncan in Dragonspear Castle's basement.

If the Shining Lady remains in Dragonspear Castle, she's pinned in the basement by Corporal Duncan and his forces. I shall go seek her, and a final end to this conflict, in the bowels of the castle.~
@65605 = ~Spoils of War

I've dealt with the looters.

I encountered a group of coalition soldiers helping themselves to treasure found in the castle. I reported them to a Flaming Fist officer, who promised to deal with the matter. There's no room for that sort of behavior in this battle.~
@65606 = ~What sort of magical aura?~
@65607 = ~I'll be the one leading the battle, Corporal. Follow me. We're going in.~
@65608 = ~It would be best if you took the lead on this. Head inside, Duncan, and I'll follow.~
@65609 = ~I need more time to prepare. I'll return when I'm ready.~
@65610 = ~Well said. Open the door, soldiers! The Shining Lady's crusade ends now!~ [BD65610]
@65611 = ~Hurry, <CHARNAME>. The longer she's able to prepare for us, the harder the battle will be.~ [BD65611]
@65612 = ~Powerful alteration magic, tinged with evil. There are illusion spells mixed in too. Walk with care.~ [BD65612]
@65613 = ~I detect powerful alteration magic, tinged with evil. Illusion magic is in play as well. We'd best be cautious in penetrating this vault.~
@65614 = ~What do you say then, <CHARNAME>? Are you ready for this final battle?~ [BD65614]
@65615 = ~I'll be the one leading the battle, Corporal. Follow me. We're going in.~
@65616 = ~Ready? No. But it needs to happen, regardless.~
@65617 = ~I need more time to prepare. I'll return when I'm ready.~
@65618 = ~You want to go in? Say the word. Soldiers! Follow the hero! The time to face Caelar has come.~ [BD65618]
@65619 = ~Caelar's crusade is at an end!~
@65620 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I'll tell Bence when I'm ready to enter the vault.

Bence Duncan and his best soldiers wait by the vault door. When I'm ready to face Caelar, I should speak with him again.~
@65621 = ~Ach, look a' this. The bluddy hero of Baldur's Gate honors us wi' his presence.~ [BD65621]
@65622 = ~We all contributed to this <DAYNIGHTALL>'s victory, duergar.~
@65623 = ~I try to bring the joy of my company to as many folk as I can, but in the end, I am but one <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Still, it's nice to be appreciated.~
@65624 = ~Show some respect, duergar.~

@65626 = ~Ye think the sheepherders an' the turnip picklers be singin' Pfaug's praises? Ye're mad, <PRO_RACE>. But ye did good work wi' the Shining Witch, an' there's no doubtin' it. ~
@65627 = ~Now be on yer way, aye? I wanna finish up here before that little rockpicker Belegarm tries t'say what plunder there is t'be had is the Fist's now.~
@65628 = ~The monkey would have us scrape and bow, would she? There are many in these walls eager to sing your praises, but my eyes are not so wide, nor my head so empty.~ [BD65628]
@65629 = ~Permit the pompous peacock a little preening, Thayan.~
@65630 = ~The gods know "the hero o' Baldur's Gate" earned th'right to boast a little. That was good work ye did wi' the Shining Witch, an' no two ways about it.~
@65631 = ~How would you know that?~ [BD65631]
@65632 = ~Hah! Would that my blade were as sharp as the strumpet's tongue.~ [BD65632]
@65633 = ~You two know what I think about banter. Shut yer mouths or get 'em away from me; I don't wanna hear it. An' you, "hero"—I'll give ye yer due. Ye did good work with the Shinin' Witch.~
@65634 = ~Caelar's gone. Won't be long before the too-talls turn on me now.~
@65635 = ~The Shining Lady's crusade lies in ruins. My patron will be most pleased with this day's doings.~
@65636 = ~Yes, yes, you dealt with Caelar Argent. Good work. What more do you want? Perhaps a pat on the head; would that make you happy?~
@65637 = ~And so another woman of strength is laid low by the entrenched power of the Sword Coast's elites. I'd be sad—if the witch hadn't had it coming.~
@65638 = ~A fine finish for a fearsome foe, and hard-fought fame found for the hero of Baldur's Gate. A more condign conclusion I couldn't concoct.~
@65639 = ~There was but one way this could end. All light will falter in the oloth of Shar.~
@65640 = ~Can't ye see I'm busy? I said ye did good; now be about yer business and leave me to mine.~
@65641 = ~Hoy there. Good work with Caelar and the portal and, you know... the Hells and whatnot. The Fist couldn't have defeated the crusade without you.~
@65642 = ~Yes, yes, what do you want now?~
@65643 = ~Ho, 'tis the hero of Baldur's Gate! Or perhaps a new sobriquet is in order: liberator of Dragonspear, bane of the Shining Lady.~ [BD65643]
@65644 = ~I am happy to be known simply by my name.~
@65645 = ~Liberator and bane... they don't really have the same ring as "hero," do they?~
@65646 = ~Let the rabble call me what they will. I am above such concerns.~
@65647 = ~Better that than what some call you. In the flush of victory, many have put aside what happened at Boareskyr Bridge—but soon you will be called upon to explain the skull and tears' appearance.~
@65648 = ~Let us l-leave that for another time, darling. It has been t-too long since we were able to spend time together w-without the shadow of one doom or another looming over us.~
@65649 = ~Sometimes it is necessary to take up arms for the greater good, but humility is the true mark of a hero.~ [BD65649]
@65650 = ~This hero could learn a thing or two about being a hero, ho ho. Leave it to Voghiln—one night and let us say three casks of ale and I will have found the words to match your deeds. Your tale will be told alongside those of the great heroes of old.~ [BD65650]
@65651 = ~Thou wilt not remain above such concerns without tempering thine arrogance.~ [BD65651]
@65652 = ~Dynaheir is wise, <CHARNAME>. Many evil backsides have been kicked these past weeks. I would hate having to add yours to the list.~ [BD65652]
@65653 = ~Take some time to savor our victory, <CHARNAME>. You earned it. My companions and I will continue working to root out any further pockets of resistance that may remain in the castle or around it. Fare thee well.~ [BD65653]
@65654 = ~First Sarevok, now Caelar Argent. Do not think your actions have gone unnoticed—or unappreciated.~
@65655 = ~Th-thank you again for what you did at Bridgefort, and here as well. The Sword Coast is in your d-debt.~
@65656 = ~I w-was not pleased with how you h-handled things at Bridgefort. But in th-the end, the greater good was served. I shall let bygones be bygones.~
@65657 = ~I have been too long chasing shadows. I must refocus my attention on the task my sisters assigned me.~ [BD65657]
@65658 = ~Do you know where I might find a cobbler? The toes of my boots are near worn through from all the—well, you know.~
@65659 = ~Caelar's threat is eliminated, but I fear I am no closer to finding the one I seek. Still, Selûne put me on this path. I must follow it, wherever it takes me.~
@65660 = ~It is our names the skalds will praise in the days and years to come, but had Caelar been victorious, things would have been different.~
@65661 = ~Ach! Voghiln is no fan of thinking. Certainly not when there is drinking to be done, ho ho! If you see a wineskin, be sure to send it mine way, ja?~
@65662 = ~I've enjoyed these past weeks as much as one can enjoy such things, but I've got to say it'll be nice to get home and see Mum again.~
@65663 = ~The time to celebrate is nigh. Once this unholy place has been consecrated in Tyr's name, I might even enjoy a sip of wine myself.~
@65664 = ~I'm impressed, <CHARNAME>. When I learned it was you in the vault, I wasn't certain you would be equal to the task. I'm rarely so pleased to be wrong.~ [BD65664]
@65665 = ~Why are you still lurking in this dismal hole? Shouldn't you be up top celebrating, or at least enjoying a well-earned rest?~ [BD65665]
@65666 = ~Could I have a moment to describe the countless ecstasies to be found suffering in Ilmater's name...? No? Another time, then.~
@65667 = ~Look at this, <CHARNAME>. Look at it lying there just... just GLOWING... what a waste.~
@65668 = ~I'm staring intently at a glowing purple substance right now. Go find something to drink or something. We can talk when I'm done.~
@65669 = ~Well met. I am Dazzo of Waterdeep, and if I may say, it has been an honor to fight alongside the former hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@65670 = ~You flatter me, sir, and I humbly thank you for it. I would speak longer, but I fear I must rest soon.~
@65671 = ~Former hero of the Gate? Have you heard something I haven't?~
@65672 = ~I am weary and have no more stomach for celebration. I would go upstairs and get some rest.~
@65673 = ~Baldur's Gate can no longer claim you for its own. You represent more than a city—you are a champion of the Sword Coast and all the realms.~
@65674 = ~You do me greater honor than I deserve, but I thank you all the same. Now if you'll excuse me, I require some rest.~
@65675 = ~Right now, all I represent is an extremely tired <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@65676 = ~I am my own <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Do not think otherwise—you will only be disappointed. Now it is time I got a decent sleep—past time, in truth.~
@65677 = ~You should head upstairs and get some rest, then, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Enjoy the respite while you can, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. You can't be sure how long the calm will last these days.~
@65678 = ~Enjoy the respite while you can, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. You can never be sure how long things will stay calm these days.~
@65679 = ~Good, you're still here. I was hoping to have a word with you in private.~ [BD65679]
@65680 = ~What can I do for you, Torsin de Lancie?~
@65681 = ~Really? Forgive me for saying so, Torsin de Lancie, but I rather got the impression you didn't like me.~
@65682 = ~I've nothing to say to you, Waterdhavian.~

@65997 = ~Have you finished work with those dragonscales yet?~
@65998 = ~Right. Well, we've got plenty of food down here, as well as sundries—blankets, lamp oil, that sort of thing. I can see why the crusade wants their mitts on it. Would let 'em run more soldiers onto the field.~
@65999 = ~So if we surrendered to the crusade and gave them what they want, we'd see more soldiers up at Dragonspear Castle.~

I've talked to the smith, next I should find and speak with Wynan Hess.

Jegg Hillcarver, the smith at Bridgefort, told me the supplies they have here are valuable to the crusade.

@66461 = ~Aw, hells. I was just about to have a nap. What do you want?~
@66462 = ~Your support in what lies ahead. Will you join me?~
@66463 = ~I was going to ask you to join me, but I hate to interrupt an elderly man's sleep. Stay here, for the time being.~
@66464 = ~Nothing. Wait for me here.~
@66465 = ~Yeah, yeah. I'll never get t'sleep now. Let's do it.~
@66466 = ~Elderly? If I weren't so tired I'd slap some sense into your fool head. 'Sides, dragons get more dangerous with age.~
@66467 = ~That's what I was doing. I was just going to get some sleep while I did it.~
@66468 = ~Would you have me return to the surface? This is no fit home for the dead, or the living, either. I yearn to breathe fresh air and hear wind rustle in the leaves once again.~

@66475 = ~I would like it best to leave this place, but I will do as you ask. If you should need me, I will be here.~
@66476 = ~So be it. If I am needed, you shall find me where we first entered this vile place.~
@66477 = ~You have need of me?~
@66478 = ~I do, Kivan—come with me.~

@66494 = ~Oh for the love of all the gods, you want to leave me HERE...?~
@66495 = ~Yes. If I've a use for you, I'll come retrieve you.~
@66496 = ~Yes, but I don't want you to stay here. Return to the crypt's entrance and wait for me there.~
@66497 = ~Never mind. You can stay with me.~
@66498 = ~Oh yes, abandon me in this dreary crypt, why don't you, casting me away as you have your social graces. So be it, I'll not be a burden.~
@66499 = ~That's what you'd like, is it? And I suppose what I'D like doesn't factor into anything? No, no, it never does.~
@66500 = ~Fine. I'll await your imminent, graceless return at the entrance to this charnel house. I bid you farewell... a farewell YOU forgot to bid me in your haste to depart, I might add.~
@66501 = ~Never mind, <PRO_HESHE> says. Like <PRO_HESHE> wasn't the one who started it in the first place. Very well, I'll not mind. Why would I? Why would I?~
@66502 = ~Why if it isn't <CHARNAME>? How have you been? I haven't seen you since... why, since you abandoned me in this dismal place.~
@66503 = ~Leaving you was a mistake. Rejoin me, please.~
@66504 = ~There are far more dismal places I could have left you, Quayle.~
@66505 = ~That sounds about right, but it hasn't been long enough. Farewell, Quayle.~
@66506 = ~Oh, leaving again, are you? How surprising. And when you have need of me, I expect you'll come running... but where to again? Oh yes, here—to the one you cast aside.~
@66507 = ~I am nothing if not a gracious man, <CHARNAME>. You made an error and you have corrected it. I can respect that.~
@66508 = ~Threats, now? I suppose I should expect no better. Why are you here, <CHARNAME>?~
@66509 = ~I need your help, Quayle. Will you come with me?~
@66510 = ~I have no idea. Should one occur to me, I'll return.~
@66511 = ~No reason at all but to bid you another farewell.~
@66512 = ~You would have me go?~

@66516 = ~If you think it best, I shall do as you ask. If I am needed, I will be here.~
@66517 = ~Not much blood to shed in a tomb, I suppose. I'll be at the entrance if you need me.~
@66518 = ~I always am. And you as well.~
@66519 = ~You have need of me?~
@66520 = ~I do, will you travel with me again?~
@66521 = ~Not at the moment. If that should change, I'll let you know.~
@66522 = ~Point me where you want me, and I'll be there.~
@66523 = ~Ah well. Perhaps next time. If you want my help, I'll be right here.~
@66524 = ~You would have Tiax leave your side? Where's the sense in that? There is none, say Tiax—and Tiax knows sense when he see it.~
@66525 = ~Stay here, Tiax. I'll fetch you if you're needed.~
@66526 = ~Return to the crypt's entrance and wait for my return.~
@66527 = ~Keeping you with me sensible? I'm not sure about that, but I'll do it anyway—for as long as you stay focused on the task at hand.~
@66528 = ~You think Tiax is unfocused? TIAX? UNFOCUSED? I say thee nay! Tiax is as focused as a gnome with spectacles! Unfocused! Cyric will rain unending death down upon thee for this insult!~
@66529 = ~Eh, what were we talking about again...?~
@66530 = ~You seek to be rid of mighty Tiax? How dare y—wait... Tiax sees... clever, very clever.~
@66531 = ~Yes, Tiax will wait. Wait for you, and we shall play a game of fetch and bloodshed in Cyric's name with the bodies of our enemies.~
@66532 = ~Tiax sees what you are doing, godling. Tiax sees all. You are clever, very clever... but are you Tiax? You are not.~
@66533 = ~So! I shall await you at this crypt's maw. And when you return... we will see what manner of welcome Tiax has for you.~
@66534 = ~Cyric told Tiax you were coming.~
@66535 = ~Did he say anything else?~
@66536 = ~I have need of you. Come with me.~
@66537 = ~I'll leave you and Cyric to chat then. I would hate to interrupt that conversation.~
@66538 = ~Many things. But those are for Tiax and Tiax alone. Are you Tiax? Tiax thought not.~
@66539 = ~Join me and find out.~
@66540 = ~I want nothing from you. Stay here until I return.~
@66541 = ~You are leaving, eh? Well-played. Well-played.~
@66542 = ~You wish Tiax to stand with you? Or is it your wish to lead Tiax to his death? Perhaps Tiax will surprise you and lead you instead... Tiax will join you, and we will see, yes, we will see.~
@66543 = ~So this is where our paths diverge.~
@66544 = ~Await me here. If I have need of you, I shall return.~
@66545 = ~Return to the crypt's entrance and wait for me there.~
@66546 = ~No, not quite yet. Our enemies are thick about us. Be on your guard.~
@66547 = ~And if you don't have need of me? No, don't tell me—I already know the answer. Very well. If I am needed again, you will find me here. IF I am needed.~
@66548 = ~As you wish. I'll wait at the entrance—should anyone come knocking, I'll let them know the <PRO_LADYLORD> of the manor is not receiving visitors.~
@66549 = ~Sound advice. I shall bear it in mind. Onward!~
@66550 = ~We meet again.~
@66551 = ~I have need of you, Xan. Come with me.~
@66552 = ~But only briefly. Wait here. If I need your help, I'll find you.~
@66553 = ~Is there anything greater than feeling needed? Probably. But enough philosophy, lead on.~
@66554 = ~You should find that easy enough, as I'll be right here where you left me. Luck to you, <CHARNAME>.~
@66555 = ~So this is where you abandon me. I knew you were not to be trusted.~
@66556 = ~Bide here a time, Xzar. I shall seek you out if your skills are needed.~
@66557 = ~Return to the crypt's entrance and await me there.~
@66558 = ~Abandon you? No. Stay close and walk with care. We don't know what lies ahead.~
@66559 = ~If you think this wise, then I will do as you ask. If I am required, you will find me here... waiting.~
@66560 = ~As you wish, so shall it be. If my skills are needed, you shall find them... and their owner... at this place's entrance.~
@66561 = ~Your concern is touching... very touching. Almost poking... prodding... stop it! Get your concern away from me—focus on the task at hand!~
@66562 = ~You have sought me out. What is it you need?~
@66563 = ~I need you at my side, Xzar. Will you join me?~
@66564 = ~I require nothing from you.~
@66565 = ~Let us see what this place has to offer, shall we?~
@66566 = ~That's what they all say. Many come to regret it. Should you do the same, I will be here for you.~
@66567 = ~You abandon me in this abysmal slaughterhouse? I am aghast at this extraordinary act of apathy.~ [BD66567]
@66568 = ~Wait here, Baeloth.~
@66569 = ~Go to the crypt's entrance. Should I have need of you, I'll seek you out there.~
@66570 = ~You're not being abandoned, drow. I need your power. Tread carefully. There are enemies all about.~
@66571 = ~An unexpected appeal, but I am always eager to accommodate. I will await you in this area.~
@66572 = ~What? You would waste the world's most wonderful wizard with... forget it. If I'm wanted, wend your way to where we entered.~
@66573 = ~Wise words from a worthy <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Lead on.~
@66574 = ~<CHARNAME>. Can you confirm the curse of Korlasz is concluded?~ [BD66574]
@66575 = ~It will be soon, with your help. Join me.~
@66576 = ~When it's done, I'll let you know.~
@66577 = ~You can depend on this drow.~
@66578 = ~I anxiously await an announcement of her extirpation.~
@66579 = ~You wish me to leave?~
@66580 = ~For the time being. Wait here until I return.~
@66581 = ~Yes. Go to the crypt's entrance. I'll find you there if I need you.~
@66582 = ~Return to the Ducal Palace. I'll find you there if I need you.~
@66583 = ~Return to camp. I'll find you there if I need you.~
@66584 = ~Actually, stay with me.~
@66585 = ~As you wish.~
@66586 = ~Very well, I shall stay.~
@66587 = ~Shall I join you once more?~
@66588 = ~Yes, come with me.~
@66589 = ~No. Remain here for the time being.~
@66590 = ~Return to the crypt's entrance. I'll find you there if I need you.~
@66591 = ~Return to the Ducal Palace. I'll find you there if I need you.~

@66595 = ~Our mage detected illusion magic. Who else is here? Don't expect me to believe you're alone.~
@66596 = ~I've little doubt you did what you thought right, Caelar. But your efforts have led to naught but chaos and destruction. Surrender now.~
@66597 = ~That's a matter of perspective.~
@66598 = ~Consider your next words carefully. They will be your last.~
@66599 = ~Many soldiers gave their lives to stop you, Caelar. Their sacrifices are the ones that matter.~ [BD66599]
@66600 = ~Hephernaan, you've caught me in your spell as well. I can't move.~ [BD66600]

@66611 = ~No singing. House rule.~
@66612 = ~Elendara would be wise to bar these penniless refugees from entering.~
@66613 = ~Had some problems here last night, my son found a tooth embedded in my boot this morning.~
@66614 = ~You get out of line, you take a walk. Understood?~
@66615 = ~Talk to someone else for a drink. I'm serving tables.~
@66616 = ~Did you order the Sprouted Ale? Sorry, wrong person.~
@66617 = ~Either sit yourselves down or get out of my way.~
@66618 = ~Stiffed by another table of refugees... A woman can't make any coin in this accursed city.~
@66619 = ~It is a shame we cannot house more refugees, but our resources are limited.~
@66620 = ~I only wish the Grand Dukes would visit us here. Sometimes I fear they are blind to this suffering.~
@66621 = ~The Calishite man has been a great help to us, though even I find him preachy.~
@66622 = ~Peace be with you my friend. I hope you can bring some cheer to these souls.~

@66630 = ~I am not of a mind to argue this again, Hephernaan.~ [BD66630]
@66631 = ~Their deaths lay heavy on us all, my lady, but they sacrificed themselves for a greater good. Letting their passing distract us would do them a disservice. Condolences can wait.~ [BD66631]

I must find a way to the lower level, where Korlasz waits.

One of Korlasz's allies told me Korlasz had been hired to steal Sarevok's sword. For what purpose, I wonder? Perhaps more answers lie further ahead. For now, I must find a way down to the lower level, where Korlasz undoubtedly waits.~
@66638 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I must find a way to the lower level, where Korlasz waits.

I dealt with one of Korlasz's allies. More threats lie ahead, I'm sure. For now, I must find a way down to the lower level, where Korlasz undoubtedly waits.~

@66643 = ~I know not which I find more insulting, that you would think me a cleric, or that I would be so fool as to kneel to the likes of Dumathoin. You are as blind as the Secret Gleam.~

I should follow Imoen to investigate the noise.

Imoen is upset. The number of refugees in the city and rumors of a war with some "crusade" are making her nervous. She came to me to say she heard noises outside her room. Now she's gone to investigate; I should probably follow.~

@66708 = ~WHAT? What whuzzat? Y'speak ill o' me mum? I—I oughta... Ye're a lucky, lucky <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>.~
@66709 = ~Ye can thank Tymora ye gotcher Flaming Fist near ye, I tell ye that much. Ah! I'm finding somewhere else t'be, far from ye.~ [BD66709]
@66710 = ~The expectations of others need not be a burden. My own destiny, to become a paladin of Tyr, as had all the men of my family, was mapped out from birth. As a boy, I fought against it. I did not embrace a life lived in service to others.~
@66711 = ~I have kept you long enough, and you have greater responsibilities upon you than trading words with me. But I may be able to help with your burdens, if you would accept it.~ [BD66711]
@66712 = ~Rayphus Goodtree

I met a paladin in service to the Flaming Fist. 

Rayphus Goodtree is a noble paladin accompanying us on the march north. He will gather any good-hearted companions of mine that I dismiss, so I can easily find them later should I need them.~
@66713 = ~No. I don't believe they're in my future, either. ~
@66714 = ~Your caution does you credit. I respect you greatly, Corwin, and I consider you a friend. I'd like to stay friends and nothing more. Can we do that?~
@66715 = ~Consider it thanks in return for allowing assassins to breach our walls, wound my friend, and nearly kill me.~
@66716 = ~Some weeks ago, we dispatched a hundred Flaming Fists to join with soldiers of Waterdeep and Daggerford and march on Caelar's stronghold—Dragonspear Castle.~ [BD66716]
@66717 = ~When you're ready to leave, <CHARNAME>, go to the palace's main doors. I'll await you there.~ [BD66717]
@66718 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I'll go rest upstairs in my room.

I'm ready to leave for the crusade as soon as possible. Once I rest in my room, upstairs in the Ducal Palace, the Flaming Fist will be ready to march.~
@66719 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I should enter the city and find supplies and allies to help me.

Captain Corwin will be my escort in the city of Baldur's Gate. She'll follow me out of the palace main entrance whenever I'm ready to leave. Once in the city I should visit its various districts, looking for companions to recruit. Corwin can guide me if I become lost.~
@66720 = ~Ah, yes, you wouldn't know... An old "friend" from my adventuring days caught up to me shortly before the iron crisis began.~
@66721 = ~Better now that she's no longer under the sway of that noxious pigdog Eldoth—but only a little better. The girl is determined to vex me. She throws herself into the jaws of the world, not realizing the dangers awaiting there. I fear it will take extreme action on my part to prevent tragedy befalling her.~ [BD66721]
@66722 = ~After her attack on you, I think her bold but reckless—willing to attempt anything to further her agenda, whatever it is.~ [BD66722]
@66723 = ~No, not really, my guess would be slightly better than yours.~ [BD66723]
@66724 = ~And if you're going to your room to sleep, let me know—we'll be leaving as soon as you wake and I could use some rest myself.~
@66725 = ~Head out the door and I'll follow you. Let's go.~
@66726 = ~Let's be off, then.~
@66727 = ~Tell me about the companions you located.~
@66728 = ~Where's my money? I collected a nice pile of gold on my adventures but I can't seem to find it.~
@66729 = ~Actually, forget the gold for now. Let's head out into the city.~
@66730 = ~Tell me about the companions you located.~
@66731 = ~I'll need to purchase some supplies.~
@66732 = ~Where's all my money? I collected a nice bit of gold on my previous adventures.~
@66733 = ~I'll need to purchase some supplies.~
@66734 = ~Where's all my money? I collected a nice bit of gold on my previous adventures.~
@66735 = ~Where's all my money? I collected a nice bit of gold on my previous adventures.~
@66736 = ~We found the drow—and in the company of a duergar, no less. They've been hired on to the Dragonspear expedition. You'll see them in the morning, should you wish to speak to them.~
@66737 = ~Where's all my money? I collected a nice bit of gold on my previous adventures.~
@66738 = ~Recruitment Drive

Coran will not join me.

I found the elven thief Coran engaged in a furious argument on the second floor of the Elfsong Tavern. It was a pleasant enough encounter, but he displayed no interest in journeying to Dragonspear. I must go without him.~
@66739 = ~Allies and Friends

Khalid has joined my party.

I've reunited with Khalid, the half-elf who knew Gorion and who has promised to look after me as best he can. If I dismiss Khalid, he will return to the siege camp outside Dragonspear Castle.~
@66740 = ~Gurgle and Floss

I dealt with the sahuagin blocking my path.

A pair of sahuagin were blocking passage through the underground river caverns. I managed to scare them sufficiently to cause them to flee.~
@66741 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

My exploration of Dragonspear Castle is complete.

I returned from my exploration of Dragonspear Castle only to find the commanders gone. Calear has requested a parley. Whatever her plans, we now have an edge with our access to the underground river and Dragonspear's basement.~
@66742 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I must go to the parley in Dead Man's Pass.

While I explored the caverns beneath Dragonspear, Caelar Argent's position changed dramatically. She has asked for parley with the coalition's commanders to discuss peace terms. I must depart for Dead Man's Pass immediately if I'm to have a part in these discussions that so directly affect my life.~
@66743 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear~
@66744 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I must find Andrus at the firepit south of camp.

The crusade has launched a surprise offensive on the camp. Bence has ordered me to meet with a wizard named Andrus on the south side of the camp. There we can plan a defense of our coalition.~
@66745 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I should check in with Nederlok at the camp entrance.

The crusade has been driven off. Our camp is safe for now. The real battle still awaits, though, at Dragonspear Castle.~
@66746 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

My next stop should be Dragonspear Castle.

Grimgor has been defeated, and the rest of the crusaders are fleeing back to Dragonspear Castle. The coalition moves in that direction. I should seek out the commanders at the Dragonspear Castle gates.~
@66747 = ~Though I like it not, it is my hope this will prove a learning experience for her—that service to the Flaming Fist will strengthen her body, mind, and character. Perhaps you will make a better role model than I.~ [BD66747]
@66748 = ~When her brother died, Skie changed. She grew wilder... Pushed me away. I am hopeful this experience will help change her priorities.~ [BD66748]
@66749 = ~You, however, know exactly who she is. I expect my daughter returned to me, alive and unharmed. I am understood, I trust? Good.~ [BD66749]
@66750 = ~Gee, thanks. Actually, I'm kind of glad you said that—it'll make what I have to say a little easier.~ [BD66750]
@66751 = ~We need to talk about you going to Dragonspear Castle. Don't do it. Don't go.~ [BD66751]
@66752 = ~Here is the hero, raring and ready to go! The early bird catches the evil worm! Haha! Isn't that right, Boo?~ [BD66752]
@66753 = ~Oh ho! Sounds like some miniature giant space hamster woke up on the wrong side of the ranger!~
@66754 = ~I got out of bed for this, and if there's one thing I'm loathe to do in a bed, it's get out of it.~ [BD66754]
@66755 = ~The sooner we reach Dragonspear Castle, the sooner we shall learn whether thy father spawned Caelar, as well as thee and Sarevok.~ [BD66755]
@66756 = ~Crusaders flee, singly and in packs, a straggling line of beaten fighters that flows away from Dragonspear Castle. They have been soundly defeated.~
@66757 = ~I told you to stay away. You should have listened!~
@66758 = ~This switch seems tied to the spike trap beneath the cage. Flipping the switch would kill anyone in the cage.~
@66759 = ~You flip the switch and spikes shoot up from the floor.~
@66760 = ~There's nothing more to do with the switch.~
@66761 = ~I'm ready.~
@66762 = ~I need to finish up a few things first.~
@66763 = ~I'm ready.~
@66764 = ~Are you? Or have you more spawn to see us off?~
@66765 = ~I need to finish up a few things first.~
@66766 = ~There's just the one of mine, but I'm sure we could find some street urchins to play with you if you'd like. No? Very well, then.~ [BD66766]
@66767 = ~Once you've gotten what you need, talk to me and we'll head out.~
@66768 = ~Well, I'd hate to bore the great hero of Baldur's Gate. We'll just be moving along now. Come away from them, Rohma.~
@66769 = ~So this is the slayer of Sarevok, the hero of Baldur's Gate. How pleased I am to make your acquaintance.~ [BD66769]
@66770 = ~As I'm sure I will be yours, once you tell me how you got in here.~
@66771 = ~The slayer of who now? I think you've got the wrong idea about me, friend.~
@66772 = ~You haven't made it yet. Perhaps I am who you say, perhaps not. Either way, what is it to you?~
@66773 = ~It is everything. Who—and what—you are is more important to me than you could possibly understand... yet.~ [BD66773]
@66774 = ~Do not try to deceive me, Bhaalspawn. That road will lead only to disappointment.~ [BD66774]
@66775 = ~If it is security you desire, it would be prudent to reconsider your sleeping arrangements. I suspect the palace's weaknesses have become all too apparent to you of late.~ [BD66775]
@66776 = ~Hmm. Strange. There lies within you barely a spark of divine consciousness, yet you bested your brother in blood. How? What is it that drove you to victory where so many others fell in defeat?~ [BD66776]
@66777 = ~The teachings of my foster father Gorion saw me through.~
@66778 = ~Sarevok was weak—ill-prepared for a real challenge.~
@66779 = ~Bhaal's blood runs strong within me. Sarevok was a fool. He underestimated its power and paid the price for it.~
@66780 = ~Gorion. His death was the first step of your current journey, was it not? I wonder, what wisdom did he impart that left such an impression?~ [BD66780]
@66781 = ~He taught me to value knowledge.~
@66782 = ~Though not the lesson he might have wished I learn, Gorion showed me that power is the key to success.~
@66783 = ~He demonstrated kindness in every aspect of his life.~
@66784 = ~He made certain I knew what I needed to know to survive.~
@66785 = ~Not all whom you face will be so vulnerable.~ [BD66785]
@66786 = ~Do not mistake power for strength. It is nothing or less than nothing unless it can be controlled, channeled toward some higher purpose.~ [BD66786]
@66787 = ~Interesting. We will see if that is enough to bear you through the trials ahead.~ [BD66787]
@66788 = ~You do not see it yet, but another crossroads in your journey lies before you—one you will reach sooner than you think. The path you choose is of interest to me.~ [BD66788]
@66789 = ~Already I see that path's course. You humble yourself, brushing off your great deeds modestly. I would see you accept the accolades you deserve.~ [BD66789]
@66790 = ~Already I see that path's course. You clutch and claw for unearned prominence and exaggerate your accomplishments. Do you not see that your deeds are great enough to stand on their own?~ [BD66790]
@66791 = ~Your path could lead in many directions. You waver, unsure whether to claim credit for your deeds or to brush them aside. I can offer you clarity.~ [BD66791]
@66792 = ~But we can speak more of this in time, when I am certain that you are the one I seek.~ [BD66792]
@66793 = ~Who are you? What do you want?~
@66794 = ~The one you seek? Are you measuring my worth then?~
@66795 = ~Enough gibberish. If you'll not speak plainly to me, perhaps you'll be more forthcoming with the Flaming Fist. Guards!~
@66796 = ~Suffice it to say that I am a man who has lost much but would regain some measure of what was taken from me. That is all you need know.~ [BD66796]
@66797 = ~Measuring it carefully and weighing it in the balance.~ [BD66797]
@66798 = ~They cannot hear you. Worry not, Bhaalspawn.~ [BD66798]
@66799 = ~I am not here to act, not yet. I am here to... evaluate. Are you worthy? Is what you carry within enough? Are YOU strong enough to overcome the challenges you shall soon face?~ [BD66799]
@66800 = ~Only the passage of time will provide us answers. I am curious to see how this plays out. I will be watching.~ [BD66800]
@66801 = ~She has bested you already, and you know it not. You are here, buried beneath the dirt, while she prepares for victory far above. Is this your grand plan? I had hoped for more from one of your lineage.~ [BD66801]
@66802 = ~Defeating Caelar will take the efforts of more than any one <PRO_MANWOMAN>, no matter how powerful <PRO_HESHE> may be. I am comfortable with the role I play. Ultimately, we will stand triumphant.~
@66803 = ~Sorry to disappoint... Tell me, what exactly would you have me do here?~
@66804 = ~My grand plan is no business of yours. Begone.~
@66805 = ~Asking what you're doing here would be wasted effort, wouldn't it?~
@66806 = ~All have a part to play, it is true. But will you stand center stage and command the respect you are due, or fade into the background, another anonymous player whose name will be lost to history?~ [BD66806]
@66807 = ~More. More than this.~ [BD66807]
@66808 = ~Hold thy tongue, boy. You do not know to whom you speak.~ [BD66808]
@66809 = ~Had I the option, I'd not speak to you at all. What do you want?~
@66810 = ~And whose fault is that?~
@66811 = ~Your army has grown fat with purpose, courageous and utterly devoted to their cause. What reason have you to be HERE, child of Bhaal? What is it that has driven you to such inglorious confines?~ [BD66811]
@66812 = ~Justice. I will see Caelar pay for the crimes committed in her mad quest.~
@66813 = ~Curiosity. I want to see where this leads.~
@66814 = ~I seek more and greater power, of course. What else is there?~
@66815 = ~Why would I tell you that? What's YOUR purpose here?~
@66816 = ~How heroic. Is that all there is? Justice is a fickle and ever-changing mistress. The line 'twixt retribution and vengeance is exceedingly thin.~ [BD66816]
@66817 = ~Curiosity has its uses, to be sure. But take care not to gaze too deeply into matters beyond your understanding, lest you find yourself in possession of answers you'd rather not have.~ [BD66817]
@66818 = ~I might have answered that question countless ways, once. But that time is long passed. You are right: There is naught but power for those with wisdom enough to see the truth. You are not without intelligence.~ [BD66818]
@66819 = ~Your path twists and forks like a serpent's tongue. With every word you utter, every enemy you fell, your soul becomes clearer to me.~ [BD66819]
@66820 = ~You left your home, engaged on this march, faced danger and death to stop Caelar Argent. And yet you refuse to use the weapon at hand, rejecting poison as "dishonorable." You would let the crusade trample innocents into the dust rather than besmirch your reputation.~ [BD66820]
@66821 = ~I see that you will let nothing stand in your way. To achieve your goals, you will use every tool in your grasp. Poison and sabotage are but another weapon to you. I respect that.~ [BD66821]
@66822 = ~I seek someone with the potential I require to move forward. I have found two candidates. Do I choose the child of light or the child of death? Which of you is worthy?~ [BD66822]
@66823 = ~We are neither of us pawns to be used in whatever game you're playing. I'll have no part of it.~
@66824 = ~I dance to my own tune, friend. I suggest you look to Caelar.~
@66825 = ~What do you know that I don't?~
@66826 = ~You believe you have a choice? That is delightful.~ [BD66826]
@66827 = ~The Shining Lady has secrets hidden even from herself, as do you. What happened on Boareskyr Bridge should have taught you that much, if nothing else.~ [BD66827]
@66828 = ~There are many forces at play, more than you realize. And there is much at stake.~ [BD66828]
@66829 = ~Dragonspear Castle offers more to you than an opportunity for reconnaissance and sabotage. There, you may spy the snake that nestles in Caelar's bosom. Use the gifts you have and you may learn more about the threat you truly face.~ [BD66829]
@66830 = ~It can keep waiting. I'm ready to head north immediately.~
@66831 = ~Are you certain? You can recruit allies and procure equipment in the city. ~
@66832 = ~A good point. Tell me about the potential allies you've located.~
@66833 = ~Hmm... In that case, perhaps I'll fetch my gold and venture out into the city.~
@66834 = ~I'm positive. The sooner we leave, the better.~
@66835 = ~Very well. We leave at first light, so get some rest upstairs. When you wake up, it will be time to leave.~
@66836 = ~Have you completed your preparations? Once we start marching north, there'll be no coming back to the city.~
@66837 = ~Yes. I'm ready to begin the march to Dragonspear.~
@66838 = ~I need a few more things. I'm going to head out into the city.~
@66839 = ~I'm not sure. I need to think about it.~
@66840 = ~Important Events

I should go upstairs and check on Imoen before I rest.

Tomorrow morning, we head for Dragonspear Castle. All I need is a good night's sleep, and we'll head out immediately in the morning.~
@66841 = ~Do I know you?~
@66842 = ~Name's Audamar Corwin. Gauntlet, Flaming Fist. Retired.~
@66843 = ~You're traveling north with my daughter, Schael. See to it she returns safely. My granddaughter, Rohma, has already lost a father, I'll not see her lose Schael too.~
@66844 = ~I see that. What's your plan? Care to join me on my quest?~
@66845 = ~On second thought, never mind. I don't care.~ [BD66845]
@66846 = ~Until then, Boo advises you to fare well. Sage words from a hamster!~ [BD66846]
@66847 = ~Big wheels turn slow. 'Twas ever thus.~ [BD66847]
@66848 = ~You have some problem with me, sir?~
@66849 = ~Aye. The Council may think the sun shines from your nethers, but I've heard the rumors. Maybe you are the hero the bards say. Or maybe you were in league with Sarevok.~
@66850 = ~Time will give us an answer to that, I suspect. Until it does, I've orders to supply you—as long as you've coin to pay for it.~
@66851 = ~What do you have for supplies?~
@66852 = ~Coin? This is no merchant expedition. I seek to save Baldur's Gate.~
@66853 = ~I have basic supplies for soldiers. You aren't one. Become a Fist and you'll get a bedroll. Otherwise, you'll have to show me some gold.~
@66854 = ~What do you have for supplies?~
@66855 = ~Never mind, then. I'll be on my way.~
@66856 = ~Monk?~
@66857 = ~Sarevok's dead. Everything's a mess. We should have gotten out of the city days ago.~ [BD66857]
@66858 = ~No chance of that now. But Korlasz knows what she's doing and— Hey, did you hear that?~ [BD66858]
@66859 = ~We'd better tell the boss. Come on.~ [BD66859]
@66860 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I should check in with Corwin at the Flaming Fist Camp.

Circumstances take me away from Baldur's Gate. Our first stop on our march is Coast Way Crossing, where the Flaming Fist intend to take a short rest. I should speak with Captain Corwin once we make camp.~
@66861 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

We'll have to reroute to Boareskyr Bridge.

With the bridge blown, the Flaming Fist will have to take the long road to Dragonspear Castle. Our new route takes us through Bridgefort, a fort on one end of Boareskyr Bridge—the place where Bhaal died. Is it chance that takes me on this path, or destiny?~
@66862 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I can leave for Bridgefort whenever I'm ready.

It will take a little time for the Flaming Fist to break camp and to scout the best route for the army to march to Bridgefort. I'm free to finish up any tasks I have left and then start out for Bridgefort on my own. I'll meet the Flaming Fist there.~
@66863 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I was able to secure the wardstone and used it to gain access to Bridgefort. 

Finally, I'm inside the fort and can speak with its defenders.~
@66864 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I've had a vision of Bhaal's death.

As I crossed Boareskyr Bridge, I was stricken with a vision of my father's death. I came to lying on the bridge, with the eyes of my allies upon me. This may cause trouble for me down the road, if rumors of my parentage spread among the coalition.~
@66865 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I can move on to Dragonspear Castle and speak with the coalition commanders there.

There's no time for me to mull over what happened on the bridge. I must push on to Dragonspear Castle and meet with the coalition commanders there. Three armies have joined—the Flaming Fist, the Waterdeep City Guard, and the Daggerford Militia—to take action against Caelar.~
@66866 = ~The Vanished

I should return to the Flaming Fist camp and find the golem.

I purchased a golem from the wizard, Teleria. It should meet me back in camp. This may be a valuable addition to our army. If I can find a way to restore the stone statues I still might be able to gain a reward from the refugees.~
@66867 = ~The Vanished

I've secured a golem ally that will help us fight at Dragonspear Castle.~
@66868 = ~Stand back! Give the army some room.~
@66869 = ~Most of this rabble has never seen a real hero.~
@66870 = ~I haven't even had my morning meal and now I have to deal with this.~
@66871 = ~Wish I could go with you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@66872 = ~We're ready to march with you!~
@66873 = ~How far is Dragonspear Castle? I hate sleeping on the ground.~
@66874 = ~I wish we could just teleport the whole army instead of walking like ordinary people.~
@66875 = ~For honor and for the city! We'll put an end to this crusade!~
@66876 = ~I believe that is her name, yes.~
@66877 = ~You believe? Either you know her or you don't. Your presence here grows more and more suspicious.~
@66878 = ~As long as you're only here for your alchemical component, I have no quarrel with you. If I see some I'll bring it to you.~
@66879 = ~Stay here and don't interfere with my work. I've important things to accomplish, and they don't involve finding moss for suspicious women.~
@66880 = ~You lie well, but you must be an ally of Korlasz. Your treachery will now mean your death.~
@66881 = ~I swear, I have no allegience to Korlasz! I traded her some rare books in exchange for access to this tomb. That's all. But it's too dangerous for me to venture on alone.~
@66882 = ~I believe you. If I find the cobalt moss, I'll bring it back to you.~
@66883 = ~That's your bad luck and has nothing to do with me. I'll be on my way.~
@66884 = ~I still think you're an enemy. That means it's time to die.~
@66885 = ~Greetings, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@66886 = ~Have a good <DAYNIGHTALL>, officer.~
@66887 = ~I saw you knock down one of those peasants. What's wrong with you?~
@66888 = ~I saw you knock down one of those peasants. An honorable person would never act in such a way. You are a symbol of both justice and strength; do not overuse the latter while neglecting the former.~
@66889 = ~I saw you knock down one of those peasants. It was pretty funny.~
@66890 = ~Same to you.~
@66891 = ~I, uh, well I don't LIKE to do it. We've got to keep the crowds off, though. Got to keep the palace safe.~
@66892 = ~You can perform your duty without unnecessary violence. These people need to trust you if you're to keep order in the city. Remember that.~
@66893 = ~If you hurt innocent people who are frightened and looking for help, you'll just drive a wedge between the law and the people. That's not what you want.~
@66894 = ~Sure, sure. Nice work if you can get it, right? I'd be knocking down peasants left and right if I were you.~
@66895 = ~Carry on, then.~
@66896 = ~You're both horrible! Boo!~
@66897 = ~Yeah! That's right.~
@66898 = ~Yes, I understand. Thank you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I'd best get back to work.~
@66899 = ~Thank you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I'd best get back to work.~
@66900 = ~I'll remember that, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Now I'd best get back to work.~
@66901 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I must defend Andrus for as long as possible.

Andrus needs time to stabilize the explosives. My job is to hold off the crusaders for as long as I can so that they don't destroy these unstable barrels.~
@66902 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

Strunk has summoned elementals to fight against the coalition. Perhaps I should have felled him when I had the chance.~
@66903 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

My golem is assisting the coalition.

The golem I bargained for now assists our coalition. I made a wise choice in acquiring it.~
@66904 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

The supplies from Bridgefort allowed the crusade to field more soldiers. 

There are more soldiers here than anticipated. I must rise to the challenge.~
@66905 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

The supplies from Bridgefort allowed the crusade to field more soldiers. 

More soldiers are here than anticipated, led by Delgar Munsch of the Bridgefort crusaders. I must rise to the challenge.~
@66906 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

The crusade is on the run. 

My allies and I have played a vital role in defeating the crusade's forces.~
@66907 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

Caelar has escaped into the Nine Hells.

Dragonspear Castle is secure, but Caelar is gone. She disappeared after Hephernaan into a portal to Avernus—some sort of plan she had has gone horribly wrong. I don't know what awaits me in Hell, but it can't be good.~
@66908 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I'll speak to Sergeant Dazzo on the stairs when I'm done celebrating.

I've returned from Avernus and the crusade is finished for good. There's nothing left to do but celebrate with my allies before retiring. Waterdhavian Sergeant Dazzo, over on the stairs to the castle's main floor, will show me where to rest when I grow tired.~
@66909 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

The crusade is finished, but my nightmare is just beginning.~
@66910 = ~It Wasn't Me

There's only one way to escape—over the waterfall.

The Flaming Fists seem convinced I'll not escape through the sewers. My only way out is over the waterfall.~
@66911 = ~Baldur's Gate is in your debt once again.~
@66912 = ~I bet the Shining Lady rues the day she caught the attention of the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@66913 = ~That was some fine work you did with Caelar. Your city's proud of you.~
@66914 = ~The Shining Lady picked a fight she couldn't win when she raised arms against you.~
@66915 = ~The Sword Coast owes you a debt of gratitude.~
@66916 = ~The crusade never stood a chance against the combined might of the soldiers of Waterdeep and the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@66917 = ~Well met, and well done. You've done the Sword Coast a great service this day.~
@66918 = ~You should come to Waterdeep. See what a real city's like.~
@66919 = ~The celebrations last long into the night. Between the feasting and the drinking, you hardly have time to shake hands with all those who want to thank the hero of Baldur's Gate and savior of Dragonspear. One by one, the celebrants stagger into the reclaimed castle to find a place to rest. It is the wee hours of the morning when you climb into your own bedroll, falling instantly into a deep sleep.~
@66920 = ~You walk along the corridors of the Ducal Palace in Baldur's Gate, only this time the walls look strange to you. It seems impossible that you should be lost in the building, but none of the turns make sense, and every door you open leads to an unfamiliar chamber. As you search with increasing desperation for your room, you realize that something is following you. Its tread is light, but you hear the echo of its passage in your own footsteps. You move faster, and faster still, racing to escape whatever it is that pursues you. Finally, you stumble into a wide chamber, only to find yourself face to face with the very creature you sought to escape.~
@66921 = ~Skie Silvershield. Born into privilege, yet driven to rebel against the destiny her father mapped out for her.~ [BD66921]
@66922 = ~She has been challenged, as you have. Has she proven worthy—or been found wanting? Let us see.~ [BD66922]
@66923 = ~What… What's happening? I—I don't understand...~ [BD66923]
@66924 = ~No! NO!~ [BD66924]
@66925 = ~How long must we wait here?~ [BDJAH001]
@66926 = ~The key taken from Caelar easily opens the vault doors. The doors creak open, releasing you from confinement.~
@66927 = ~May Lathander watch over you as well, sister. I seek counsel on fighting undead.~
@66928 = ~Sword of Ruin +2~
@66929 = ~This wide, heavy blade gives way to jagged teeth near its tip, a serrated edge designed to rip and tear flesh. Little is known of the blade's origin, but the elaborate grip marked with worn runes hints that it may have been crafted in ancient Unther.

@66936 = ~I... am defeated. As Sarevok was. He was going to change the Sword Coast forever, and I was going to be a part of it.~ [BD66936]
@66937 = ~The Mummy's Orders

When I return to the mummy upstairs, I'll be rewarded.

Korlasz is defeated. The mummy I disturbed earlier will be happy; I should return to it for my reward.~
@66938 = ~These rivvin have tolerated my presence thus far thanks to you, <CHARNAME>. But I know not how much longer that patience will last.~ [BD66938]
@66939 = ~I'm kind of tired of packing and unpacking, town to town, up and down the Sword Coast.~
@66940 = ~Be careful around these cages. The prisoners are dangerous.~
@66941 = ~It took six of us to wrestle that half-orc into a cage!~
@66942 = ~Toe the line or YOU'LL wind up in one of these cages.~
@66943 = ~Enemies of the crusade must pay the price.~
@66944 = ~The half-orc won't eat, won't sleep. He just glares at us.~
@66945 = ~You here for a reason? If not you'd best be on your way. We have to keep these prisoners secure.~
@66946 = ~We can't get through that cavern with the fishfolk in it.~
@66947 = ~Those damn sahuagin are blockin' the way. Then again, we don't have to go on patrol as long as they're there. I suppose it all works out.~
@66948 = ~Maybe I can deal with them for you.~
@66949 = ~That's a philosophical way to look at it.~
@66950 = ~If you can't defeat them, you deserve to be stuck out here.~
@66951 = ~It's up to you. We're just going to take it easy.~
@66952 = ~Guess so, when you put it like that.~
@66953 = ~We can't get through that cavern with the fishfolk in it.~
@66954 = ~Those sahuagin came racing out of the cave hells-bent for something. Ran right into our blades and we cut 'em down. Guess it's back to work now.~
@66955 = ~Important Events

I should continue to seek out Korlasz and her followers.

One of Korlasz's followers mentioned a "sword" that was "already gone." I don't know why he thought I would come after this mysterious sword. Perhaps Korlasz holds more answers.~
@66956 = ~Sarevok's Secret

I've uncovered the secret room, and its contents are mine.

Using the code gleaned from Sarevok's notes, I accessed a secret room in the temple of Cyric. It seems I still follow the path my half-brother laid out for me months ago.~
@66957 = ~The Shattered Staff~
@66958 = ~*uses a scroll*~
@66959 = ~*uses a wand*~
@66960 = ~Talk to me when you're ready to leave, <CHARNAME>.~
@66961 = ~Is it a vampire you're hunting? There was one in a nearby cave, and I staked it. It's dead.~
@66962 = ~Truly? You have saved us a world of trouble, stranger, and dealt justice to an evil creature.~
@66963 = ~The vampire is already dead. I found it in its cave and staked it through the heart.~
@66964 = ~A pale man lies within this coffin. His eyes are closed, and he appears to be dead.~
@66965 = ~Isabella and Ikros

If I visit the hunters' camp I may gain a reward.

I found a vampire in a cave and drove a stake through its heart. The creature collapsed into dust. There were a pair of vampire hunters nearby; perhaps they will reward me for my deed.~
@66966 = ~Isabella and Ikros

I've destroyed a vampire.

I found a vampire in a cave and drove a stake through its heart. The creature collapsed into dust.~
@66967 = ~The Uncommon Cold

I should speak to Dosia about the sick patients.

I've spoken to all the patients and discovered what I could. Now I must return to the healer, Dosia, and determine what to do next.~
@66968 = ~*attempts to hide in shadows*~
@66969 = ~*attempts to detect illusions*~
@66970 = ~Memories of Battles Past

I should speak to Warden Twoedged again.

I've learned something about what the people in camp think of war. Once I return to Warden Twoedged, we can talk about my thoughts.~
@66971 = ~No one's allowed in or out of the camp. Caelar's called us to prepare for battle and we can't risk spies or scouts getting in.~
@66972 = ~See here, I have this seal. Grant me entry.~
@66973 = ~But I've been in camp before. Someone will vouch for me.~
@66974 = ~Farewell, then.~
@66975 = ~Sorry. Orders come straight from the Shining Lady, and she had one o' them spellslingers put a magical barrier up to bar the gates. I couldn't let you in even if I wanted to.~
@66976 = ~On your way.~
@66977 = ~This magical barrier hums with arcane power. Beyond, the camp buzzes with activity as the crusaders prepare for battle.~
@66978 = ~I found this journal in a cave nearby. It mentions you by name, and your eggs.~
@66979 = ~My clutch... my precious eggs, lost to me so long ago. I never knew how. Or why...~ [BD66979]
@66980 = ~The necromancer responsible for this atrocity must be long dead. But my hatchlings—did you see them? Do they yet live?~ [BD66980]
@66981 = ~I am sorry, Halatathlaer. Their years of imprisonment had twisted them, turned them into horrors. Quickly ending their lives was the greatest mercy I could offer.~
@66982 = ~They are dead. I'll not burden you with the details, but please believe me when I say they're better off that way.~
@66983 = ~They attacked me and lost their miserable lives as a consequence.~
@66984 = ~My poor children... But at least I know they are at peace, and I thank you for that. I am bound by magic and cannot help you while my essence is trapped. Find and free it and I will aid you. Good luck, traveler.~ [BD66984]
@66985 = ~Wretch! Villain! I would strike you down where you stand were I able to do so. Begone! I shall tarry with you no longer.~
@66986 = ~Ghost Dragon Guardian

The ghost dragon is gone.

The dragon ghost Halatathlaer helped me to destroy the cabal once it was freed. When I told it I had killed its hatchlings, though, it disappeared in a rage.~
@66987 = ~I guess we need every hand we can get to put an end to Caelar and her followers.~
@66988 = ~Nothing to fear from the gobbie, eh? What about you? I heard what happened on Boareskyr Bridge...~
@66989 = ~I was at Bridgefort. I saw what you did there—and what happened when you crossed Boareskyr Bridge. An' ye're friends with a goblin too!~
@66990 = ~After what happened on Boareskyr Bridge, I'm not finding that as comforting as I would've not so long ago.~
@66991 = ~You're the hero of Baldur's Gate, right? I was at Bridgefort—heard about what happened on Boareskyr Bridge. I don't know about you...~
@66992 = ~<CHARNAME>. Looks like you made it from Bridgefort none the worse for wear.~
@66993 = ~It's good to see you again, Jegg.~
@66994 = ~Yes... "Looks."~
@66995 = ~I've little use for kind words, smith. What I require is your skill.~
@66996 = ~I'm not sure how good it is t'see you again. I heard what happened on Boareskyr Bridge.~
@66997 = ~Let me see what weapons and armor you have in stock.~
@66998 = ~You were working on some armor for M'Khiin. Is it finished?~
@66999 = ~I brought you some stones to work with. Did you manage to do anything with them?~
@67000 = ~You were going to make something from those dragon scales. Did you do it?~
@67001 = ~Can you turn these stones I retrieved during the attack on Bridgefort into something useful?~
@67002 = ~Huh... Those are—those are kinda disturbing, aren't they? Yeah, I think I could do something with them. What kind of weapon were you thinking of?~
@67003 = ~Could you craft a fine sword?~
@67004 = ~How about a warhammer?~
@67005 = ~Keen arrows would serve me well.~
@67006 = ~They look like they would make fine sling bullets.~
@67007 = ~Actually, I'll hang onto them a little longer.~
@67008 = ~I'll have your weapon ready for you.~
@67009 = ~That's fine by me. The less time I have to spend with the cursed things, the happier I'll be.~
@67010 = ~Let me take a look... Aye, aye. I should be able to do something with 'em. Come see me in three days.~
@67011 = ~Oh. I think you'll be very happy with the result.~
@67012 = ~I've been run ragged since I got here. It'll take a while yet. Check back later.~
@67013 = ~My work calls to me. Axes high, right?~
@67014 = ~Here's what I have—what I've got that I'm comfortable sending into battle, anyway.~
@67015 = ~Armor'd be nice. Sick of being poked. Sicker of bleeding.~
@67016 = ~You want me to make armor... for a goblin. Next you'll want a two handed sword for a dog. All right, I'll see what I can do.~
@67017 = ~You heard about that new recruit, right? Comely lass, but she can't open her mouth without complaining. It's driving her commanding officer mad, but every time he tries to discipline her, Duncan countermands him.~
@67018 = ~Skie's Grand Plan

It would seem that Skie Silvershield is making few friends in her new life serving the Flaming Fist.~
@67019 = ~I heard tell the crusade's already crossed the Winding Water. Burnt down an inn. Caelar's got nerve, acting the righteous warrior like she does.~
@67020 = ~Important Events

Word has reached me that the crusade has already made moves south of Coast Way Crossing. It's only a rumor, but if true, the Shining Lady is advancing even faster than expected.~
@67021 = ~Ghel Hando says he ran into a pair of civilians hunting a vampire in the woods not too far from here. Like I didn't have enough trouble sleeping at night, right?~
@67022 = ~I was talking to some of the refugees we passed on the road. I don't know how that Caelar does it. Her followers burned down some of these peoples' homes, and they STILL think she's the gods' gift to Toril.~
@67023 = ~Important Events

Though her minions do terrible things in her name, it seems Caelar Argent's is nigh irresistible. Even many of those wronged by her hold her in high esteem.~
@67024 = ~You heard about the kidnappings that happened back in the Gate? It's not a good time to be worshipping Selûne, I'll tell you that much. Eh. Worshipping the Moonmaiden never made sense to me anyway. I'll take a nice cavern ceiling to stare up at over the moon any night.~
@67025 = ~Important Events

Faithful of Selûne have been going missing in Baldur's Gate. Perhaps after my mission here is complete I can investigate these disappearances.~
@67026 = ~If it's entertainment you're looking for, I hear there's a fighting pit not too far from Coast Way Crossing. Apparently it's not much if you appreciate displays of martial skill, but some say it's good for a laugh.~
@67027 = ~Important Events

Apparently there's a fighting pit in the area. It might prove an interesting diversion.~
@67028 = ~You heard about this? Clerics of more than a dozen gods left Baldur's Gate less than a tenday before us, heading to Dragonspear to seek an audience with the Shining Lady. They hope to turn her from her path. Waste of bloody time, you ask me.~
@67029 = ~Important Events

Caelar is certainly garnering a lot of attention. Her influence seems to be spreading.~
@67030 = ~There was a hooded fellow here asking about you. Something about him made me real uneasy. There were the scars, and the voice, those were bad enough. But there's something more about him. Something really... off.~
@67031 = ~Disturbing Implications

The strange man in the hood was here asking about me. What could he want? What's his interest in me?~
@67032 = ~I think we got out of Baldur's Gate at just the right time. Word is food is running out and even water's getting scarce. The city's gonna tear itself apart if Caelar isn't stopped.~
@67033 = ~Important Events

The crusade's movements are starting to affect the cities. Trade routes are disrupted and goods aren't reaching people.~
@67034 = ~I hear the Shadow Thieves find themselves facing a little competition. Don't know who's got the steel to challenge 'em, but someone is, so I'm told.~
@67035 = ~Important Events

An unknown faction has been competing with the Shadow Thieves. I don't believe this will impact the Dragonspear mission, but perhaps someday the information will be of use.~
@67036 = ~This is rich; you're gonna love this: That lass, the new recruit? She and Duncan have been sharing bedrolls. That's why she's got him wrapped 'round her finger. But you didn't hear it from me.~
@67037 = ~Skie's Grand Plan

Rumors of Skie Silvershield's connection to Bence Duncan have begun to spread through the camp, though for the moment her true identity remains a mystery to most of those on the Dragonspear expedition.~
@67038 = ~Have you heard anything about a temple of Bhaal 'round these parts? I was talking to a cleric the other day who said one was once not too far from here. Same thing happened to it as happened to the Lord of Murder—Cyric destroyed it.~
@67039 = ~Important Events

Apparently there's a destroyed Temple of Bhaal in the area.~
@67040 = ~Have you noticed how there's no one come down the road from Boareskyr Bridge of late? Something bad's happened there. I can feel it in my bones.~
@67041 = ~Important Events

Looks like the crusade is building a presence at Bridgefort.~
@67042 = ~I heard tell from several of those fleeing Caelar of a monstrous half-orc making its way towards Bridgefort. Well-spoken for a half-orc, they say, but still a half-orc—as vicious as they come.~
@67043 = ~Important Events

Looks like the crusade is building a presence at Bridgefort.~
@67044 = ~A cooper from Bridgefort wandered through not too long ago with an interesting story. As he tells it, there's a circle of stones outside the fort that'll magically transport people into it—when the circle works, anyway.~
@67045 = ~Important Events

A magical circle of stones might afford a way into Bridgefort.~
@67046 = ~Seems everyone who follows Caelar Argent isn't as in love with her adviser Hephernaan. He puts on a smile for Her Shininess, but I'm told he can be a right bastard. But that's true of most worshippers of Ilmater, I suppose.~
@67047 = ~Important Events

Caelar's adviser is a priest of Ilmater named Hephernaan.~
@67048 = ~I've heard a group of clerics looking to convince Caelar she's on an unrighteous path made it to Dragonspear and have been promised an audience with the Shining Lady when she returns. Maybe they can talk some sense into her.~
@67049 = ~Important Events

Caelar is certainly garnering a lot of attention. Her influence seems to be spreading.~
@67050 = ~It's not all bad news to the north. The people of Innisfall village managed to escape just hours, minutes even, before the crusade attacked. They lost some supplies, but no lives. That's something, right?~
@67051 = ~Important Events

Looks like the crusade is building a presence at Bridgefort.~
@67052 = ~I've had words with Bence Duncan about those commanding our forces at Dragonspear. Marshal Nederlok's good people, lives and breathes the Flaming Fist. General Stonehand of Daggerford's a bit of a handful, apparently. It's Cedric de Lancie of Waterdeep you've gotta be careful of. He's a schemer, that one. You can't trust a schemer.~
@67053 = ~Important Events

The three commanders of the armies are Marshal Nederlok of the Flaming Fist, General Stonehand of Daggerford's milita, and Torsin de Lancie of the Waterdeep City Guard.~
@67054 = ~Some are saying those what fled Bridgefort and ended up in Soubar maybe would've been better off if they'd not fled at all. Two people want to rule the place, both are vicious, and the refugees are caught in the middle.~
@67055 = ~Important Events

The rest of Faerûn has its own share of problems, it seems.~
@67056 = ~Say, you haven't been having any, er, visions or anything like that lately, have you? There's a man in a hood, lots of scars on his face, been asking. I don't like talking to him, but I like the look he gives me when I don't talk to him even less, you know?~
@67057 = ~Disturbing Implications

The strange man in the hood was here asking about me. What could he want? What's his interest in me?~
@67058 = ~Things in the Gate have gotten even worse since we left. People are rioting at the Ducal Palace's gates, so I'm told, an' the only break a Flaming Fist gets now is a few hours before they're resurrected.~
@67059 = ~Important Events

The crusade's movements are starting to affect the cities. Trade routes are disrupted and goods aren't reaching people.~
@67060 = ~That girl that joined the Fist just before we left the Gate? Watch yourself around her. She's not just another soldier. Can't say more than that, but watch yourself. She's got friends in high places.~
@67061 = ~Skie's Grand Plan

Word that Skie Silvershield is not who she claims to be has begun to spread through the camp. Whether people know she is a Grand Duke's daughter, I am not sure.~
@67062 = ~If you're looking to enjoy a game of chance, ask around for Col. But remember what my mother told me: If you can't afford to lose it, make sure you don't bet it.~
@67063 = ~Important Events

Gossip regarding the commanders and soldiers in camp is taking up the soldiers' time. Once we move on the castle, there will be less time for idle speculation.~
@67064 = ~You feeling all right? You may be the only one. de Lancie and the other commanders are trying to keep it quiet, but plague's spreading through the camp. And I hear the clerics aren't having any luck stopping it.~
@67065 = ~The Uncommon Cold

A sickness spreads through camp. It must be stopped before more people fall ill.~
@67066 = ~You know the dragon atop Dragonspear isn't Daeros Dragonspear's dragon? Is that weird or what?~
@67067 = ~Important Events

Gossip regarding the commanders and soldiers in camp is taking up the soldiers' time. Once we move on the castle, there will be less time for idle speculation.~
@67068 = ~I heard Caelar's zealots leveled what was left of the dwarf houses around Dragonspear. Filled in the cellars, everything. It's a disgrace, is what it is.~
@67069 = ~Important Events

The crusade is building a strong presence at Dragonspear Castle.~
@67070 = ~That Torsin de Lancie is as cold as they come. He doesn't care a whit for his people, honor, anything but getting himself ahead. If he weren't so good at it, someone would've put a knife 'twixt his shoulders years ago.~
@67071 = ~Important Events

Gossip regarding the commanders and soldiers in camp is taking up the soldiers' time. Once we move on the castle, there will be less time for idle speculation.~
@67072 = ~You heard about this Elvaius fellow? Always manages to disappear just before trouble starts, so they say. If everyone were like him, there'd be no war because nobody'd hang around to fight it.~
@67073 = ~Important Events

Gossip regarding the commanders and soldiers in camp is taking up the soldiers' time. Once we move on the castle, there will be less time for idle speculation.~
@67074 = ~I was talking to that Dugdeep gel. She's mad as hats on a mongoose, that one. Says the Lords of Waterdeep are planning to transport Mirabar stone for construction in the city. Lunacy!~
@67075 = ~Important Events

Gossip regarding the commanders and soldiers in camp is taking up the soldiers' time. Once we move on the castle, there will be less time for idle speculation.~
@67076 = ~I hear there's a rift 'twixt the Prime and the Fugue Plane in Dragonspear Castle. Wonder if that's why the crusade's made its base there?~
@67077 = ~Important Events

A portal to the Fugue Plane apparently exists beneath Dragonspear Castle. That's the plane where the spirits of the dead visit.~
@67078 = ~Used to be Dragonspear Castle was crawling with all manner of monster. Then Caelar took it over and cleared it out—singlehandedly, so they say. You gotta wonder if she's better or worse than what was there before?~
@67079 = ~Important Events

It seems there are few who are not fascinated with Caelar Argent. Even in the camp of the coalition of forces arrayed against her, some think she may be the lesser of the evils that might reside within Dragonspear Castle.~
@67080 = ~Officially, there's no thieves' guild in Waterdeep. That may be true, I don't know, I don't live in Waterdeep. But someone's working to put one together in camp, I can tell you that much.~
@67081 = ~Den of Thieves

I've heard rumors that a thieves' guild is starting up in camp. This could undermine the strength of our troops.~
@67082 = ~Sounds like Vigilant Halasan's about had it with the soldiers she's been ordered to train. Way things are going, some of 'em may not live long enough to make it to Dragonspear.~
@67083 = ~Troop Train

Vigilant Halasan might need a hand training some new recruits.~
@67084 = ~My people tell tales of a lost dwarven village that used to be around here. Kanaglym, it was called—built on the bank of an underground river that stole the memories of those that lived there.~
@67085 = ~Important Events

The ruins of a dwarven city, Kanaglym, lie somewhere in the area.~
@67086 = ~I heard not all the crusade's prisoners willingly bend their knee to Caelar. Some are taken into caverns beneath Dragonspear, never to be heard from again. That's what some are saying, anyway.~
@67087 = ~Important Events

The crusade makes use of caverns beneath Dragonspear Castle.~
@67088 = ~A band of clerics, clerics of all different gods, went to Dragonspear to try and convince Caelar to abandon her crusade. They were promised an audience, but the night before it was to happen, they disappeared, every last one of them, so I've heard. What does that tell you, eh?~
@67089 = ~Important Events

The crusade is building a strong presence at Dragonspear Castle.~
@67090 = ~You know that hooded fellow, the one with the scars? You might want to watch him. I heard him talking to a couple of Daggerfordians, telling 'em things about you. Don't know if they're true or not, but either way they weren't the sort of thing that's gonna win you any admirers, you know?~
@67091 = ~Disturbing Implications

The strange man in the hood was here asking about me. What could he want? What's his interest in me?~

I write to rectify the confusion in which your last missive was apparently sent. Your reply in regards to my next manuscript, "Adventuring With All Your Limbs Attached: Both There And Back Again" is my latest treatsie on the adventuring mage's life. As the greatest first-level mage who has ever lived (so far), my musings and experiences are of considerable value to both the novice and seasoned adventurer. Not only is my writing style light and entertaining to read, but the contents of my manuscript could save many lives.

You understand my confusion, then, when I recieved your reply that your line of comedic tomes was full for this year and to try again in future seasons. Please check your informative travelogue lineup and respond at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,

Alveus Malcanter~

@67256 = ~(This parchment has been torn at the top. It seems to have been ripped from a larger piece.)

Rule Three: Taverns can be of great use for surviving an adventure. Before venturing into that dank tomb or bleak dungeon, visit the local tavern. Buy lots of drinks. Soon your party will be merrily singing and drinking the night away. While they sleep off their excesses the next morning, you can quietly leave town.

Rule Four: Some will tell you that second-level spells are necessary for a successful career. Don't believe them! With great power comes great responsibility, so if you stick to first-level spells, no one will expect you to stick your neck out into a dangerous situation.

Rule Five: A mage is only as good as their robe. Though you may never rival my exquisite collection of Faerûn's finest robes (may? I am too humble. None could rival that collection of finery), you would do well to obtain a quality tailor at the first opportunity.

Remember, with intelligence, discretion, and an overwhelming, shrieking, constant fear of death, you too can be a successful adventuring mage!~
@67257 = ~Alveus Note 03~
@67258 = ~Potential Aphorisms

A green slime in the hand is worth nothing, and also you now have no hand. Wear gloves at all times.

A statue is just a potential gargoyle. Carry a statue-poking stick and give it to someone in heavy armor.

A pocketful of gold is good; a sackful of gold is better. But carrying a huge sack of gold makes it hard to run away, so a bag of holding is a good investment.

Something about bacon? "Your bacon's in the fire" is bad, but bacon is also delicious...

@67260 = ~(This note is titled "Advice to a Novice Mage.")

If you are reading this, then you are, perhaps, a young mage just starting out on your career. You might aspire to the heights of some of the greatest wizards in Faerûn. "Elminster," you think to yourself. "Blackstaff. Malcanter."

NO, not Malcanter! You chuckle at your foolishness. Who could ever compete with the greatest first-level mage to have ever lived (so far)?

I am here to tell you that while, in truth, you cannot hope to ever acquire the seasoned and respected name I have made for myself, you can at least hope to reach the plateau from which my shadow seems just slightly less long and chilly as it envelops you. If you follow my advice, you will be well on your way to becoming a second-rate imitation of myself.

Rule One: There are some that believe taking credit for a job well done is the easiest way to build a reputation. But taking credit for a job someone ELSE did well and is now dead so they can't contradict you anyway is, in fact, more effic—

– Middle, Middle is good too. Surround yourself with hulking companions in full plate armor.

(Here follows a doodle of a stick figure in a pointy hat surrounded by armored individuals carrying enormous swords.)

– Can also follow way behind group. Say one hundred yards. Cast spells from a distance and join in when the looting begins.

– Perhaps one mile behind party? They can scream if they need help.

@67265 = ~Alveus Note 07~
@67266 = ~My Dearest Agythi,

It was with no little joy that I received your missive. Corresponding with those who have read my books and learning how my advice has positively affected their lives is a source of great pleasure for me. That you were able to write such a letter without the use of your arms makes the feat even more impressive—I suspect in the future you will take my oft-repeated mantra "Do not wrestle an angry ogre, or indeed any ogre, if it can be avoided" to heart.

I gather from your note that you found my words less useful than one might have hoped when it came to the matter of the ogre wrestling. I have some questions regarding the events that led to such an unfortunate happenstance:

1) How did you come to find yourself in amongst a pack of savage, bloodthirsty ogres? Over the years, I have offered many suggestions and strategies designed to help the prudent adventurer avoid just such a situation as this. If nothing else, my advice regarding the fortifying of one's home and the frequency with which one leaves it (my advice being "never"), if followed, should have prevented such a circumstance as this from ever occurring.

2) Who challenged whom to the wrestling match? I do hope that it was the ogre's idea, as I'm quite certain the flaws in such a scheme originating from your side of the equation have become painfully self-evident.

3) Had you ever considered a profession that carries with it slightly less risk of having one's arms torn off by a redblooding great ogre? Those who aren't cut out for adventure will often find themselves torn from it if they fail to act with the appropriate level of caution. Though they lack the potential glory a lucky few are able to wrest from a life of exploration and action, there is no shame whatsoever in fulfilling the role of a farmer, a courtesan, a tailor, or any number of other, more banal occupations. Someone has to shine my boots, after all.

However you came to this regrettable state, I hope you will take some solace in the enclosed copy of my latest book. As you are a reader of my work, I have signed the volume and shall have the messenger take ten percent off the price I generally charge. May you find some enlightenment or entertainment in its pages during your period of convalescence.

Yours very truly,
Alveus Malcanter~

The Shining Lady
The shining hair and glowing eyes of our great leader, Caelar Argent, tell a tale of the divine; she is the last and greatest member of a line birthed of gods and a family of paladins. For generations, the Argents served as noble knights of Lathander.

Caelar believed she too would join the ranks of the Order of the Aster. But her vision was too vast for the Order’s limited faith. Her demands to take unflinching action against the forces of evil fell on deafened ears. Caelar left the knighthood, seeking a means by which to fulfill her righteous vision.

(Scrawled notation: No mention of her transgression or its abominable repercussions. Records must exist in Waterdeep. When you receive these notes, seek out the Order’s chapterhouse and see what you can find.)

An Auspicious Meeting
Caelar wandered the world alone, learning all she could of the evils that threatened it. The knowledge she gained filled her with anguish. Hers was a vision of glory, but how could she bring that glory to a dark world doing naught but growing darker?

Her doubts took her to a bridge overlooking the Winding Way. She looked into the dark waters flowing below and questioned all she had once believed to be true. Perhaps she was wrong. Perhaps she had not been chosen to rid the world of evil.

It was in this, her greatest moment of doubt, that Brother Hephernaan appeared. Seeing in him a good and gentle soul, Caelar told Hephernaan of her troubles. And when her tale was told, he said, "The people of the land long for righteousness. The gods have blessed you with a vision. You know what you must do.”

And Caelar did.

(Scrawled notation: We know too little about this Hephernaan. Caelar relies fully on him, but does he serve her interests or his own? When I return to Berdusk, I’ll see what information I can dig up.)

Our Glorious Purpose
Together, Caelar and Hephernaan called out to the people of Faerûn. From the coasts and the plains, the mountains and the deserts, men and women of courage and righteous conviction answered Caelar’s call, flocking to the Shining Lady’s banner.

The fulfillment of Caelar’s vision is at hand. Goodness and justice will prevail—with your help. Together, we will free the unjustly damned and smite the evil that dares lay claim on mortal souls. An age of light is about to break through the darkness. Will you be a part of it?

(Scrawled notation: This crusade may be more dangerous than we initially thought. We have agents near Baldur’s Gate; I’ll ask them to investigate the crusader camp near Bridgefort. Perhaps we can head Caelar off before she does too much damage.)~

@68376 = ~I appreciate the offer, Jaheira. And more, I accept it.~
@68377 = ~I cannot promise that, and do not wish to bring you any more grief. Best we keep our distance, for the time being at least.~

@68383 = ~When I opened my eyes to the world as it is, rather than the one I would have it be.~

@68388 = ~Who's responsible is something for history to determine. What matters is that it end, soon, and preferably at my hand.~
@68389 = ~Precious little. Finding out more about him was one of the reasons Khalid and I were sent—ah, chose to come here.~
@68390 = ~He is a Revered Brother—a monk of a sort, but one who claims to serve not one but all the gods. By all accounts, he is Caelar's most trusted advisor. Beyond that, we know nothing.~

@68392 = ~Too many questions and too many corpses. Whatever the answers, Caelar's gotta be stopped.~
@68393 = ~We know that Hephernaan, Caelar, all who would oppose us will fall. That's enough for me.~

@68489 = ~This is truly a pity. But life goes on, and so does mighty Voghiln.~

Entry 1
Humans want to pay Myf to kill other humans. That’s a good thing, methinks. This camp full of magic humans who want to tell Myf about their gods. Me not care about anyone but Yeenoghu, but let humans talk. Tall officer say his name "Mor-alle" teach Myf to make words on paper. Practice every day, Myf. Myf write lots so far. Now Myf write about me and stupid humans. Give me lots of gold to kill other humans, then take gold back to pack.

Entry 6
Leader of humans shine like sun. Her name Kaylar. Kaylar wants to talk trolls, asks me to take trolls. Myf say no! Trolls eat us all! Kaylar put her hand on Myf’s shoulder. She say all creatures, gnolls and stupid humans and trolls, can serve her light. Kaylar’s voice nice but her words make no sense. Myf is not in light. Trolls will eat us.

Entry 8
Myf was right and Kaylar was right. How can both be right? Trolls came out of cave ready to eat us all. Then Kaylar talks about her light. Promises gold and food. Some trolls think this is good, like Myf did. Get lots of gold and take it back to pack. Then other trolls yell and say no, stupid. Say Kaylar is making a trap. Trolls fight each other. Try to eat us. Kaylar tries to stop them, says wait listen to me. Trolls don’t listen just fight. Myf helps kill a troll and sets it on fire (but steals an arm to eat. Very stringy). Kaylar and other humans put nets and chains around trolls. Now they locked up in camp. Kaylar tells the Brother Hefernan she is sad. She say "my arrow gants cause many innow sense deaths." Brother say it’s not Kaylar’s fault but Myf think maybe it is.

Entry 20
Big ceremony tonight called the Lightning but there was no lightning. Just a big fire and we all chant. Brother started and we said what he said. People yelled that they saw light. Myf didn’t see light. There was light inside though. A fire in Myf’s chest. Felt hot and strong. Kaylar came out and her eyes were like fire. Maybe trolls should have said they work for gold.

Entry 24
Kaylar marched us to old castle. She came to Myf and put hand on shoulder again. She smells good, but not like prey. Strong. She said Myf I am cownting on you to keep trolls in a line. The fire lit up inside again, like the Lightning night. Me made sure trolls all walked very straight. None eat us. We stopped to camp and Kaylar said good job Myf. Pack never says good job Myf.

Entry 30
On way to castle we pass by Myf’s home. Pack hides in hills. Pockets are full of gold but me not go to pack. They don’t have fire inside and if Myf left Kaylar would be sad. Who look after trolls? Myf has important job here. Myf not let Kaylar down.~

@69147 = ~In 1255 DR, Daeros Dragonspear completed construction of the fortress that would soon bear his name: Dragonspear Castle. Daeros first broke ground on the High Moor to be near the lair of his dragon ally, Halatathlaer. Residents of the High Moor recall seeing Daeros taking regular flights on the great copper dragon's back.

(Annotation: I located architectural sketches of the castle. Appears Dragonspear built his castle directly above Halatathlaer’s lair. May explain reports of a ghostly draconic presence nearby—must warn crusaders not to interfere with it.)

Many coveted Dragonspear’s castle and the wealth of his dragon ally, and in 1290 DR the wizard Ithtaerus executed a complicated plan. By wielding his considerable magic and manipulating other dragons into attacking the castle, Ithtaerus brought about the deaths of both Dragonspear and Halatathlaer. He had little time to enjoy his victory, though, as one of his dragon allies slew him in a rage after discovering that Ithtaerus had made off with Halatathlaer’s hoard.

(Annotation: If the dragon’s spirit still lingers, perhaps Daeros’s spirit also remains trapped within the castle’s ruins. Divinations reveal a portal to the Fugue Plane stands somewhere nearby. This would be the perfect place to intercept souls. Then we can use them to fuel the ritual and bolster our ranks.)

Dragonspear Castle lay in ruins, but Ithtaerus’s attack had left a dreadful legacy. Beneath the castle, a portal to Avernus, the first layer of Hell, had opened up.

For a time, hobgoblins and bandits used the castle as a base from which to conduct raids across the High Moor. Unbeknownst to anyone, devils had found the portal’s other end in Avernus and were quietly infiltrating the castle. In 1354 DR, the devil launched a massive attack, seizing the castle. Forces from Waterdeep and Baldur’s Gate eventually marched on the castle in the first Dragonspear War.

(Annotation: They could not destroy the portal, though. My research indicates it remains present, though dormant. Blood tainted by a god’s influence is required to activate its power. H requires us to secure the portal room the moment we take control of the castle.)

Devils returned to Faerûn in 1363 DR, when they retook the castle and raised an army. They marched all the way to Daggerford, destroying buildings and slaughtering innocents along their way. A group of adventurers, brought together by chance and necessity, destroyed the army and saw the portal sealed forever.

@69204 = ~Belt of the Cunning Rogue~
@69205 = ~This wide leather belt has been dyed a deep magenta. The belt was created over a decade ago by a human thief who saw his larcenous activities as a means of worshiping Mask. All his burglaries were undertaken with prayers to Mask, and he hoarded his stolen goods at a hidden altar to the god of thieves. He favored purple clothing, believing it was a color the god preferred, and he crafted this belt to match his ensemble. The thief was eventually caught and killed on one of his missions and the belt confiscated by the city guard. The next night, the belt vanished from a locked chest in the guardhouse, though, whisked away by Mask so that it could continue to serve the god's ends. Even today, the belt often finds its way into the path of those who will put it to good use.

All other members in absentia

Destroyer of Ancient Enemies: As is known, I have long laid claim to a singular mortal’s soul, one with divine—

Consumer of Souls: We know your plans well. How could they escape our notice? You’ve spoken of little BUT your return to the Prime Material plane ever since you returned to us.

She Who Walks: Let us not waste time reviewing THIS yet again. Shall we move on to the next item?

Destroyer: We will follow the agenda! That is the order of things and order guides us in all.

Lord of the Razor Peaks: Infinity weighs heavily on an unstimulated mind.

She Who Walks: Infinity, yes, but it’s been, what, a century by mortal reckoning? This continued obsession wearies me.

Destroyer: Perhaps changing circumstances will prove more intriguing than my “wearisome” ordeal. Another has claimed the soul I seek. The Exile is a mortal, yes, but he is possessed of dire power, sufficient even to threaten us.

\[Scribe’s Hand: A mortal powerful enough to challenge my master? This cannot be!\]

She Who Walks: He wouldn’t dare provoke our wrath.

Destroyer: Are you certain of that? He is IN Baldur’s Gate. He stalks MY prey. 

Consumer of Souls: Such arrogance! He must know the Accord supports your claim.

Destroyer: He keeps his distance—for now. But if he seizes what is ours, you must be prepared to act as the terms of our alliance dictate.

\[Scribe’s Hand: They do not know, none of them know! When the Destroyer’s plans unfold, they will all appreciate his cunning!\]

She Who Walks: We have sworn with our blood to uphold this accord. If the Exile challenges one, he challenges all.

Consumer of Souls: Agreed.

Lord of the Razor Hills: The past is consumed as if in a fiery furnace. We must turn our gaze to the future.

She Who Walks: Indeed. Let us move on to the next item.

Destroyer: By all means. 

\[Scribe’s Hand: They look at him and see a lowly worm, but the Destroyer is the strongest of them all! Soon everyone will know this truth, and I will say with pride that I serve him!\]~

@69224 = ~Glimmer of Hope +2~
@69225 = ~A pacifist priest of Ilmater carried this mace to warn off would-be evildoers, but never lifted the weapon in battle. He preached that all thinking creatures had the capacity for good in them, and that to destroy another life was to rob it of its potential. His fellow priests, though respectful of his views, did not take their philosophy to such an extreme. Few were surprised when the priest was waylaid by bandits and killed one day. His mace was recovered and brought back to the temple, and the other priests were amazed to find a small diamond embedded in the tip. The diamond flashes with brilliance from time to time, blessing its wielder and filling them with a sense of hope.

@69229 = ~Noted dwarven smith Hedda Perigot crafted this suit of armor in response to a challenge. Fellow smiths discussed their disdain of working with non-metal or stone materials at the tavern one night, and Hedda bragged that she had no such difficulties. The smiths challenged her to create a hybrid suit of half-metal, half-armor. Hedda set to work making the lightest, most flexible steel plates she could and affixing them to a well-made leather breastplate. The result was a shimmering suit of splint mail that weighed less than a normal suit and proved most useful against slashing attacks. Hedda won the bet, and free drinks for a month.

She designed the suit so that if she were ever incapacitated in any way, she would be rendered temporarily invisible. The armor did its job, and the thief had a long and successful career in the city. When she retired, she gifted the armor to her younger brother, and it has changed hands many times since then.

@69234 = ~Hide Armor +1~
@69235 = ~Hide armor is made from the thick hide of a very large animal (an elephant for example) or from many layers of normal leather from common animals, like cows. Hide armor is far too bulky, inflexible and heavy to be used much in advanced human cultures. However, among the barbaric humanoid masses throughout the dark forests and misty jungles of the world, hide armor is common. Even though it does offer more protection than leather armor, one must get by the offensive odor and shoddy appearance in order to wear it effectively. Even though Thieves can wear this armor, it has a negative effect on their abilities. This armor is enchanted, granting the wearer additional protection.

@69256 = ~Turning this mighty wheel raises a platform up into Dragonspear Castle's basement. Unfortunately, the wheel has clearly been designed with ogres in mind, and strength alone will not make it turn. Your size makes it impossible for you to use the platform to reach the castle.~

@69574 = ~There are few who'd like to see Caelar's light snuffed out more than I, but you're a fool if you think it might happen this day. Her advisor, Hephernaan, and the mage Oloneiros are with her. Their magic is proof against all but the most powerful spells.~ [BD69574]
@69575 = ~You wear the skin of my kind! Raaargh!~
@69576 = ~Green Dragon Breath~
@69577 = ~You know what they say—he who smelt it...~ [BD69577]
@69578 = ~You throw the dagger at the dragon and strike it in the heart. Death for the dragon is instant.~
@69579 = ~Orc~
@69580 = ~Orc
Orcs are the hereditary enemies of goblins and hobgoblins, with whom they often compete for resources. Reasonably intelligent carnivores, orcs are constantly waging war against other races to maintain their tribes. These wars thin the weak predators from their tribes and gather resources for the next generation. Orcs have a reputation for being extremely powerful warriors. Wizards have tried to create orcish variants to take advantage of the race's natural ferocity and strength.~
@69581 = ~Shadow~
@69582 = ~Shadow
Shadows are malevolent, undead creatures that drain strength from their victims with their chilling touch. Those so afflicted can look forward to becoming a shadow themselves if contact continues. ~
@69583 = ~Elemental~
@69584 = ~Elemental
Elementals are sentient beings that can possess bodies made of one of the four basic elements that make up the Prime Material Plane: air, earth, fire, and water.~
@69585 = ~Demonic/Fell~
@69586 = ~Demonic/Fell
Creatures under this banner can include any number of fiends from the lower planes. All are malevolent and powerful, and great care should be taken not to fall under their influence.~
@69587 = ~Dragon~
@69588 = ~Dragon
Dragons are an ancient, winged reptilian race. They are known and feared for their size, physical prowess, and magical abilities. The oldest dragons are among the most powerful creatures in the world. Chromatic dragons are generally evil in nature, while metallic dragons tend towards good. ~
@69589 = ~Troll~
@69590 = ~Troll
Trolls are horrid carnivores that are most well known for being hard to kill. All trolls regenerate, and most can only be killed through the use of fire.~
@69591 = ~Steady on, my stalwart sidekick. Your standard stability seems to be slumping somewhat...~
@69592 = ~Clara~
@69593 = ~Murs DEAD! No! Slug smash EVERYTHING.~
@69594 = ~The Dungeon Slug

I've finished my dealings with Slug.

Slug returned to camp but, on finding Murs dead, turned violent. I had to defend myself.~
@69595 = ~When asked about his past, Baeloth Barrityl, or "Baeloth the Entertainer" as the drow prefers to be called, maintains that in his Underdark homeland he commanded great respect as a sorcerer. Now on the surface, he makes a living instead pitting combatants against one another in betting rings. "My shows were the best in all the realms," he muses fondly, though his last great endeavor ended in disaster.

Baeloth attempted to regain some of his renown with a new fighting pit, only to learn that giving forest animals fierce names was not enough to draw the attention of the spectators. After repeatedly failing to inspire bloodthirsty rage in squirrels and mice, he abandoned the effort and moved on. You have a feeling Baeloth is still looking for his next great exploit.~
@69596 = ~When pressed to reveal her past, Caelar tells a tale repeated a thousand times over in her mind. As a child, Caelar Argent labored under the high expectations that came with her semi-divine heritage. Her early life in a monastery of the Order of the Aster was a hard one as Caelar's temperamental nature did not fit comfortably with the Asters' devotion to discipline. She believed, even then, that she was destined for great things. One day, alone in the chapterhouse library, she attempted to grow her powers by reading from a tome of forbidden knowledge. Instead she unwittingly opened a gate to the realm of the devil Belhifet. Caelar's soul should have been forfeit, but her uncle, Aun Argent, offered himself to the devil prince and was pulled down into the Nine Hells in his niece's place. Caelar never forgot his sacrifice. She vowed that someday, somehow, she would find a way to rescue her uncle from the pit of Avernus. After more than a decade in seclusion, she made contact with the Revered Brother Hephernaan. He offered her a path to Avernus, but walking it would not be easy. She would, he claimed, require three things: an army to fight the legions of the Nine Hells, possession of Dragonspear Castle, and the divine blood that was the key to opening the portal beneath the castle...~
@69597 = ~When asked about her past, Schael Corwin reluctantly admits she ran wild as a child on the streets of Baldur's Gate. Her rebelliousness soon got her into trouble with the Flaming Fist. 

Left alone in a cell with nothing but her thoughts for company, she began to reflect on the decisions she'd made in the past and see where they would inevitably take her. When she was eventually freed, she decided to change the direction of her life. She enlisted in the Flaming Fist and rose quickly through the ranks.

You sense there is little Schael Corwin would not do for her family or for the Flaming Fist.~
@69598 = ~When asked about his past, DORN IL-KHAN shows little interest in sharing details of his past. That he serves a demonic master is no secret, but beyond his dedication to his patron, Ur-Gothoz, Dorn says nothing about himself. From offhand comments and insinuations, you gather that the half-orc suffered some painful betrayal in the past, an offense he has neither forgiven nor forgotten. 

According to Dorn, Ur-Gothoz commanded him to seek out and destroy an individual at the crusader camp during the ceremony of the Enlightenment. Dorn attempted this task but was thwarted and imprisoned instead. He now longs for vengeance against those who dared to cage him.~
@69599 = ~When asked about her past, DYNAHEIR tells you only that she journeys on a private mission. Her goals, whatever they are, appear to line up with yours, and she seems happy to travel at your side. 

Dynaheir and her bodyguard, Minsc, come from the nation of Rashemen. Occasionally, they speak of their home. Dynaheir belongs to an order of spellcasters known as the Witches of Rashemen, ferocious enemies of the Red Wizards of Thay. The very mention of the hated Red Wizards brings a spark to Dynaheir's eyes and a snap to her voice.~
@69600 = ~When asked about his past, Edwin mutters darkly that you already know more than is good for you. Edwin mutters quite often to himself, apparently preferring his own conversation to that of others. 

Despite his eccentricities, Edwin is a powerful and intelligent mage, as evidenced by his membership in the Red Wizards of Thay. Edwin grudgingly admits that he and several other Red Wizards were on a journey when they were waylaid and pressed into service by Caelar's crusade. Two of his allies joined the crusade, and a third was slain. Edwin escaped, vowing vengeance on Caelar. 

He frequently refers to the Shining Lady as "witch," an obvious slur given that the Red Wizards' hated enemies include the Witches of Rashemen.~
@69601 = ~When asked about his past, GLINT GARDNERSONSON tends to use three words where one will do and constantly breaks off on tangents as he speaks. Eventually, you learn that he comes from a large family and has always been seen as something of a troublemaker. He gained his nickname, "Three-Eyes," when his exasperated mother exclaimed that she needed three eyes to keep watch on him. 

Glint happily expounds on his many adventures since leaving home; it's difficult to tell where reality ends and exaggeration begins. Though Glint initially ventured from Baldur's Gate in search of several missing relatives, he seems to have been caught up in the mission of ending Caelar's crusade.~
@69602 = ~~
@69603 = ~When asked about his past, Khalid nervously reveals that he was born and raised in the nation of Calimshan. From offhand comments he makes, you gather he was not favored by either of his parents but particularly not by his father. Khalid joined the city militia as soon as he was able and made his career there for a time. 

He leaves the details of how he met Jaheira unclear, but you know he and his wife both belong to a secretive order known as the Harpers. Their appearance at Bridgefort just as the crusade arrived may not have been coincidence, but Khalid anxiously denies the Harpers sent him to stop the crusade.~
@69604 = ~When asked about her past, M'Khiin grunts and says you'll sleep easier if you don't know her story. 

Eventually, she shares with you that her goblin tribe was a vicious and brutal one. As a shaman, M'Khiin commanded some degree of respect, but her abilities also brought her a maturity the other goblins lacked. She wanted desperately to escape from the cruelty of her life, but the other goblins valued her abilities too much to let her go. 

One night, a goblin scouting party came across a deer caught in a thicket of brambles. They killed the animal and carried it triumphantly back to camp. M'Khiin waited until the others had stuffed themselves on raw meat and fallen into a post-meal stupor, then crept away. 

She's been on her own ever since and has found herself persecuted by humans at every turn. She joined Baeloth Barrityl with the understanding that she would be presented as an "exhibit" but not made to actually fight—a promise Baeloth broke the minute the opportunity presented itself.~
@69605 = ~MINSC proudly proclaims himself a berserker warrior from the nation of Rashemen. He is currently undertaking his dejemma, a ritual journey all young Rashemi men undergo. 

His companion Dynaheir, whom he protects as part of his mission, is never far from his side. Dynaheir apparently has some interest in seeing the crusade stopped, and Minsc will follow wherever she leads. Indeed, "his witch," as Minsc calls her, is one of the few people from whom he will take direction. 

He also gives great weight to the "words" of his miniature giant space hamster, Boo. Neither you nor your other companions can hear Boo speak. It's possible Minsc has taken too many blows to the head. Still, his great strength and berserker rage should prove a danger to the crusaders you encounter.~
@69606 = ~When asked about her past, NEERA says little. She alludes to an "interesting" childhood as her wild magic powers developed, as well as a difficult time pursued by Red Wizards who wanted to study her and kill her (not necessarily in that order). She seems more interested in the future—preferably a future where a fellow wild mage named Adoy no longer speaks in her mind. 

The constant voice nattering away in her head is clearly driving the young half-elf to distraction. She seems willing to battle the entire crusade at once if it will get Adoy out of her head.~
@69607 = ~When asked about his past, Rasaad speaks sorrowfully about losing his brother, Gamaz, to the Shadow Thieves of Athkatla. He attempts to put that tragedy behind him through his worship of Selûne and his commitment to the Order of the Sun Soul. 

After the events of the iron crisis, Rasaad decided his calling was to serve those less fortunate than himself. The refugees entering Baldur's Gate required a great deal of assistance. Rasaad volunteered to run a refugee camp out of the old Iron Throne building. 

After some reflection, though, Rasaad decided that putting a stop to the crusade was an equally important goal, and set off for Dragonspear Castle to do so.~
@69608 = ~When asked about her past, Safana spins tale upon tale involving fantastic liaisons with pirate captains, nobles, and royalty of all shapes and sizes. Her most recent escapades seem to be truthful; she took up with an elf named Coran, and while the relationship seemed amusing for a time, she and Coran recently parted ways. She confides to you that Coran was "just too much. Wouldn't stop hanging off me in the most pathetic way." 

Always on the lookout for the next exciting adventure—and perhaps needing to leave Baldur's Gate for a reason she hasn't shared—Safana joined the expedition to Dragonspear for "as long as it remains amusing."~
@69609 = ~When asked about her past, Viconia snaps that there is nothing about her you need to know. Over time, you've learned that Viconia is a drow from the city of Menzoberranzan, though she left her home some time ago for unspecified reasons. 

Life on the surface has been hard for Viconia. She turned away from the traditional drow worship of Lolth and instead venerates Shar, goddess of darkness and loss. Viconia still finds the customs and mannerisms of surface-dwellers strange and takes malicious amusement in watching others struggle to decide how best to deal with her. 

Traveling with you has afforded Viconia some measure of protection, and she seems content, for the time being, to remain in your company during the march to Dragonspear Castle.~
@69610 = ~When asked about his past, Voghiln speaks at considerable length of his travels in the North. Originally from Luskan, Voghiln felt the call of adventure and set out on a journey to the Spine of the World. For the next few years, he traveled among the northernmost countries, including Vaasa and the Silver Marches, building up his repertoire and his reputation as a skald. 

Near the story's end, Voghiln hastily glosses over a bit where he decided to travel south for a time. No amount of persuasion convinces him to reveal why he truly left the North. Instead, Voghiln said, he came north chasing new adventures and new "womans." 

Despite his fondness for drink and his propensity for chasing skirts, Voghiln is a brave and talented companion who is eager to see the crusade come to an end—mostly so that he can write about it.~
@69611 = ~On the Fence

@69660 = ~Thank you for saving me.~
@69661 = ~You have my thanks, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. May the Morninglord bless you and keep you.~
@69662 = ~<CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@69663 = ~I'm a gift horse. You want to look me in the mouth or get the hells out of this place?~
@69664 = ~You waste time asking foolish questions. Go, leave this place now, before I change my mind and slay you myself.~
@69665 = ~You did it!~
@69666 = ~Thank the gods, we're saved.~
@69667 = ~You may not be utterly useless after all. Well done.~
@69668 = ~<CHARNAME>, you've s-saved us all!~
@69669 = ~How may I assist you?~
@69670 = ~Of course. Here you are.~
@69671 = ~I have one in my possession. Now it is yours.~
@69672 = ~The crusade wants to take Bridgefort's supplies. The food and weapons they have stockpiled will allow us to muster more troops at Dragonspear Castle. Once we have the supplies, we'll blow up the bridge so that no one can follow us north.~
@69673 = ~Farewell, friend.~
@69674 = ~I want the spell scroll you used to enchant the rock that hit Bridgefort. Hand it over.~
@69675 = ~Do you know where I can find a feather from a planetar's wing?~
@69676 = ~You can tell me what the crusade is doing here. What are their plans?~
@69677 = ~Nothing for now.~
@69678 = ~I'll be going now.~
@69679 = ~I have another question for you.~
@69680 = ~Thanks. I must be on my way.~
@69681 = ~I have another question for you.~
@69682 = ~I see. I should take my leave of you now.~
@69683 = ~I have another question for you.~
@69684 = ~We won't. With the combined forces of Waterdeep, Daggerford, and Baldur's Gate, our victory is certain.~
@69685 = ~Skie's Gone Missing

Skie is safe for the moment.

I informed Nederlok about Skie's rescue. He was glad to hear the news. He's set Skie to filling sandbags in the meantime to keep her out of trouble.~
@69686 = ~Skie's Gone Missing~
@69687 = ~If it weren't for you, we would have all shared that fate. I would give you my seal—the mark of a true crusader—but it seems I've lost it. Tell Ladle at the supply depot east of here that you helped me—he will reward you. You have my thanks.~
@69688 = ~Halfling Treasures

Takos the halfling innkeeper was extremely happy to see the heirlooms I found, but less happy when I decided to keep them all. The idiot attacked me. It was a futile effort on his part.~

Now that I've retrieved the promised cache, I should check on Slug back at the ogre camp aboveground.~
@69691 = ~The Wounded Zealot

I should find a priest in the triage area who can heal Hyreth.

Hyreth has agreed that I can heal him once I find a priest. There must be a healer in this triage area; perhaps they can help me.~

@69693 = ~Good. I'll be back after I speak with this Ophyllis.~
@69694 = ~As you wish.~

@69766 = ~The mark of Bhaal does not in itself prove guilt. But it does cast a darker shadow of suspicion upon the accused. We cannot forget that Sarevok, another spawn of Bhaal, brought our city to the brink of war.~ [BD69766]
@69767 = ~Our diviners have presented evidence of your deeds since leaving Baldur's Gate, deeds that speak to your character.~ [BD69767]
@69768 = ~Is there anything you wish to say in your defense?~ [BD69768]
@69769 = ~I would never have killed Skie. All the evidence shows I am not a murderer.~
@69770 = ~I can't remember what happened at the castle, but I'm certain I am no murderer. My character is my defense.~
@69771 = ~I am no hero. I've done many terrible things in my life... and done them proudly. If I HAD killed Skie Silvershield, I would freely admit it.~
@69772 = ~I do not know if I killed the woman. It's all a blur. But I do have something I want to say.~
@69773 = ~I've nothing to say. I await your judgment.~
@69774 = ~Elaborate.~
@69775 = ~When I met a former servant of Bhaal, I instructed her to atone for her crimes and do good in the world. I am not a slave to my father's will.~
@69776 = ~I had no qualms about releasing a former priestess of Bhaal into the world. I would admit at once if I committed murder.~
@69777 = ~I was asked to poison the crusaders' supplies at Dragonspear Castle but flatly refused. Poison and murder are a cowards' tools.~
@69778 = ~I was given a special mission at Dragonspear Castle: Poison the crusaders' supplies. Any tool is a useful one in war. I agreed to the task. I don't hide my deeds.~
@69779 = ~When soldiers at the coalition camp fell ill, I could have recommended they be killed to prevent infection. Instead, I did all that I could to find a cure. I ask you, is this the act of a murderer?~
@69780 = ~When I suspected a traitor at the coalition camp, I executed them immediately. I would tell you if I thought Skie needed to die.~
@69781 = ~The pursuit of Caelar took me to the wastes of Avernus. A fiend offered to let me pass freely there—if I sacrificed one of my companions. I offered myself up instead.~
@69782 = ~In the Nine Hells' depths, I willingly sacrificed one of my companions for no reason other than to ease my passage. I admit it freely. Now ask yourselves: Why would I take responsibility for that sin—for all my sins—yet deny I slew the girl?~
@69783 = ~I am a paladin, a holy warrior. My god still blesses me with divine power. Were I guilty of this crime, that would not be the case.~
@69784 = ~I serve the forces of darkness. I willingly declare it now, before you all. Had I committed this crime, I would admit it—revel in it, even.~
@69785 = ~My deeds are well known throughout the land. Many call me "hero." Surely that speaks to my character.~
@69786 = ~My deeds are notorious throughout the land. I embrace my reputation—why, then, would I deny murder?~
@69787 = ~I've nothing else to say.~
@69788 = ~So noted.~ [BD69788]
@69789 = ~Is there anything more you would say in your defense?~ [BD69789]
@69790 = ~No. I'm ready for your decision.~
@69791 = ~Yes, there is.~
@69792 = ~We've heard much evidence today, both for your character and against it. Now we—what is that commotion?~ [BD69792]
@69793 = ~Do not tell me what I want—I KNOW what I want. You! <CHARNAME>! MURDERER! You killed my little girl... my Skie...~ [BD69793]
@69794 = ~You must believe me, Duke Silvershield, I was not responsible for her death.~
@69795 = ~I don't know what happened to Skie. But I intend to find out.~
@69796 = ~Cease your whimpering, man. You're embarrassing yourself.~
@69797 = ~You put on a good act, but I KNOW the truth. It wasn't enough to slay her bodily and leave me childless? You had to destroy her soul too?~ [BD69797]
@69798 = ~This is not the time—~ [BD69798]
@69799 = ~Tell me what you did with it, fiend! Before they send you to the gallows, tell me, what did you do with the dagger?~ [BD69799]
@69800 = ~Dagger...? There was a dagger, I remember. What became of it I do not know. ~
@69801 = ~Please calm yourself, Duke Silvershield. I don't know what you're talking about.~
@69802 = ~What are you going on about? I know nothing of any dagger.~

@69806 = ~If you have wizards divining the evidence, surely they can discover who murdered Skie?~
@69807 = ~What is this "dagger" Duke Silvershield spoke of? What happened to Skie's soul?~
@69808 = ~I doubt there's anything I can do to convince you of my innocence. Your mind is made up.~
@69809 = ~A powerful force obscured divinations at the time of the murder. That in itself is highly suspicious and points to premeditation. However, we have learned one important fact.~ [BD69809]
@69810 = ~Peering into the Weave, our diviners determined that Skie Silvershield's soul now languishes within an artifact called the Soultaker Dagger. All efforts to locate the dagger have amounted to naught.~ [BD69810]
@69811 = ~While her essence is imprisoned thus, Skie can never be returned to life. If we had the Soultaker, she might possibly be restored, and confirm your innocence—if indeed you are innocent.~ [BD69811]
@69812 = ~Guilty, I say! GUILTY!~ [BD69812]
@69813 = ~The Flaming Fist will take custody of the prisoner until a decision is reached. Take him away.~ [BD69813]
@69814 = ~Disturbing Implications

I've given the best defense I can.

Duke Belt listened to reports from my companions, the coalition commanders, and near everyone else who encountered me on the trip north. I believe I acquitted myself well, but I know not what awaits me now...~
@69815 = ~Disturbing Implications

I've given the best defense I can.

Duke Belt listened to reports from my companions, the coalition commanders, and everyone else who had anything to do with me on the trip north. I believe I proved that if I HAD killed Skie, I would have done so much differently. All I can do now is await the verdict.~
@69816 = ~Disturbing Implications

I've given the best defense I can.

Duke Belt listened to reports from my companions, the coalition commanders, and near everyone else who encountered me on the trip north. All I can do now is await the verdict.~
@69817 = ~Skie's Soul

A distraught Duke Silvershield interrupted my trial. His daughter's soul is trapped in an artifact called the Soultaker Dagger. The blade is missing. Without it, Skie cannot be restored to life.~
@69818 = ~Fly to me, butterflies! Shield me in your colorful wings whilst I support this glorious crusade!~
@69819 = ~I fight for you, Julann!~
@69820 = ~How are you, <CHARNAME>?~ [BD69820]
@69821 = ~Duke Belt—it is good to see you. I have news. I know who slew Skie now.~
@69822 = ~I'll be a damn sight better when I'm freed from this cell.~
@69823 = ~Don't waste my time with idle conversation, Belt. I've no patience for it.~
@69824 = ~As you wish.~ [BD69824]
@69825 = ~Were you anyone else, this would be a simple matter. For Entar, it is VERY simple—he wants your head. That will not change any time soon, certainly not while his daughter remains in her current state.~ [BD69825]
@69826 = ~But you are the slayer of Sarevok. The hero of Baldur's Gate. The champion of Dragonspear. Your service to the Sword Coast is beyond dispute.~ [BD69826]
@69827 = ~Unfortunately, your heritage is now also beyond dispute. There can be no peace for a child of Bhaal. Those near you will inevitably suffer, as Skie did—that is your nature.~ [BD69827]
@69828 = ~There are as many people in this city ready to fight and die for you as there are those baying for your blood. Baldur's Gate is in turmoil.~ [BD69828]
@69829 = ~After extensive deliberations, Eltan, Liia Jannath, and I have decided it would be best for all if you—and the darkness within you—left Baldur's Gate as quietly as possible.~ [BD69829]
@69830 = ~Grand Duke Silvershield disagrees. Strongly. When he learns you are gone, he will not rest until you are dead—certainly not while the Soultaker Dagger remains beyond his grasp. Be wary in your travels.~ [BD69830]
@69831 = ~You know the killer's name? You have proof?~ [BD69831]
@69832 = ~I have neither his name nor proof of his crime, but you must find him nonetheless, if you would see justice served.~
@69833 = ~Release me and I'll get you both.~
@69834 = ~I can offer you nothing more than my word that I speak the truth. If that is insufficient, so be it. Say your piece and begone.~
@69835 = ~Justice is an ideal we must all strive for. But circumstances do not allow for the ideal. The Council of Four must bow to the practical.~ [BD69835]
@69836 = ~A guard will escort you out of the city. This is a poor reward for all you have done for us, I know, but it is the best we are allowed. Go someplace far from here, and do not return.~ [BD69836]
@69837 = ~Fare thee well, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD69837]
@69838 = ~It Wasn't Me

I will be escorted from the city once I collect my belongings.

The Council of Four has decided to release me, though not in the way I might have hoped. Once I retrieve my belongings from the Flaming Fist headquarters basement, I am to be exiled from the city, possibly forever.~
@69839 = ~Follow me.~ [BD69839]
@69840 = ~Do you want out or not? Come, the stairs are here.~
@69841 = ~I figured you weren't another Sarevok. I think I figured wrong.~ [BD69841]
@69842 = ~Your deeds will catch up with you soon enough.~ [BD69842]
@69843 = ~This is a disgrace. Everything you've done for this city and this is what you get? It's not right, says I.~ [BD69843]
@69844 = ~Get out of here, spawn of Bhaal. City's got troubles enough without you.~ [BD69844]
@69845 = ~I don't care what they say about the Silvershield woman. You killed Sarevok. You closed a gate to the Nine Hells. Gotta be a hard woman to do a hard job.~ [BD69845]
@69846 = ~You destroyed the Iron Throne and Caelar's crusade. A noble brat's a small price to pay for all that, far as I'm concerned.~ [BD69846]
@69847 = ~Your belongings are on the table. Take what you can carry and head down through the trapdoor. I'll wait for you downstairs.~ [BD69847]
@69848 = ~Ready to say farewell to Baldur’s Gate?~ [BD69848]
@69849 = ~I am.~
@69850 = ~It seems I've little choice in the matter.~
@69851 = ~Not yet.~
@69852 = ~Make it quick; we need to move soon. When you've done what you need to do, let me know and I'll escort you out of the city.~ [BD69852]
@69853 = ~That a "yes" or a "no"?~ [BD69853]
@69854 = ~Yes. Let's move forward.~
@69855 = ~No. I'm not ready to go yet.~
@69856 = ~Follow me and stay close. We'll be traveling through tunnels beneath the city—Duke Belt wants you kept away from the public. Rightly so, I think.~ [BD69856]
@69857 = ~Go down the stairs and head west. The cavern comes up outside the city gates.~ [BD69857]
@69858 = ~You have my thanks.~
@69859 = ~I didn't do it, you know. I wasn't the one who killed Skie Silvershield.~
@69860 = ~You've served your purpose. Begone.~
@69861 = ~I believe you.~ [BD69861]
@69862 = ~My cousin was in Bridgefort. The crusade's spellstone had poisoned her—she was on the edge of death. You saved her.~ [BD69862]
@69863 = ~My brother was in the Dragonspear siege camp, wounded in the crusade's assault. He told me he would've died if you hadn't turned the tide of the attack.~ [BD69863]
@69864 = ~You saved the city from Sarevok. You saved the Sword Coast from the Nine Hells. I don't care what anyone says about you. You're a hero, and that's all there is to it. Farewell, <CHARNAME>.~ [BD69864]
@69865 = ~Before you go, there's something I would say to you.~ [BD69865]
@69866 = ~Watch your back. Grand Duke Silvershield has a long reach.~ [BD69866]
@69867 = ~It Wasn't Me

I am to leave the city of Baldur's Gate.

Though my past deeds have convinced most of the Council of Four I did not murder Skie Silvershield, I am still to be exiled from the city. Skie's father has vowed vengeance upon me for a crime I now know I did not commit, sowing the seeds of discord amongst the Grand Dukes. If I am ever to return safely, I must prove my innocence.~
@69868 = ~Imoen! How did you know where to find me?~
@69869 = ~I thought I was leaving the city in secret.~
@69870 = ~Duke Jannath told me what was happening. She offered to send a messenger if I wanted to keep training with her, but I... no. I wouldn't do that to you.~
@69871 = ~Well, we're together again now, and that's the way it's going to stay. I'm not letting you out of my sight ever again. Come on. The sooner we're away from here, the better.~
@69872 = ~It Wasn't Me

I have been reunited with Imoen. Now I must leave Baldur's Gate for a time.

Imoen and <CHARNAME>, together again. Now that I am free, I can clear my name. I must learn more of this hooded man.~
@69873 = ~It is good to see thee, <CHARNAME>. I am glad the Council saw past thy blood, to thy heart.~
@69874 = ~This viper's pit of a city has wronged you, <CHARNAME>, but you are not alone. Do not let despair overtake your heart. You have your freedom at least, and with freedom there is hope.~
@69875 = ~Well m-met, friend. Do not be disheartened in wh-what has happened. Gorion believed in your g-goodness, and so will th-those who accuse you, in t-time. I am sure of it.~
@69876 = ~Could we maybe talk about this someplace, you know—far away from here?~ [BD39717]
@69877 = ~Before we do that, I need to thank you, all of you, for joining me in my hour of need.~
@69878 = ~Before we do that, I need to thank both of you, for joining me in my hour of need.~
@69879 = ~Forgive me, Imoen. Some of these are not the faces I expected to see upon my release.~
@69880 = ~Before we go, I am well-acquainted with most of our friends here, but there's at least one face here I did not expect to see.~
@69881 = ~As far away as possible. Let's go.~
@69882 = ~We shall leave at the time of my choosing.~
@69883 = ~The Council of Four might not be willing to stand by you, but I always will. Now let's get some distance between you and Duke Silvershield, all right?~
@69884 = ~If you hadn't just gotten out of a cell you'd have an argument on your hands. Fine. You lead, I'll follow.~
@69885 = ~It may have looked different from your cell, but you have more friends than you knew.~
@69886 = ~And I appreciate every one.~
@69887 = ~And at least one fewer. Where's Voghiln? Passed out on a tavern floor, most like.~
@69888 = ~It's just as well M'Khiin isn't here. A goblin amongst us would surely attract attention.~
@69889 = ~Mine sisters bid me learn what I can of the Bhaalspawn. Thou art the key to understanding Great Alaundo's prophecy, and so I shall follow thee.~
@69890 = ~And where Dynaheir goes, so goes Minsc. And where Minsc goes, so goes Boo. And where Boo goes... well... There also goes Minsc. Eh. You get the idea.~
@69891 = ~I promised Gorion I would do all in my power to keep you safe. I shall honor that vow.~
@69892 = ~As w-will I.~
@69893 = ~I t-told Gorion I would help you as best I could, and so I sh-shall, reg-gardless the cost.~
@69894 = ~Minsc has heard many a tale of your dark deeds, <CHARNAME>. But Boo says tales and truth are different things, and in my experience, Boo knows best.~
@69895 = ~You—you saved us! Bless you, bless you! We don't have much, but please, take this, and our thanks with it.~
@69896 = ~Ask <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@69897 = ~I don't want to be a bother. I especially don't want to bother someone that looks like <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@69898 = ~Ye want to bother me then, do ye? Ask <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@69899 = ~Yer pardon, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?~
@69900 = ~Well met, friend. How can I be of service?~
@69901 = ~Asked and given. Though I should warn you a pardon is likely all you'll be given...~
@69902 = ~Begone, wretch.~
@69903 = ~Beggin' yer forgiveness, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. We'll just be on our way then.~
@69904 = ~See, Myrleena? I told ye <PRO_HESHE> wasn't gonna help us.~
@69905 = ~We've been on the road days, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I don't know how many.~
@69906 = ~Stlarnin' Caelar and her stlarnin' crusaders burnt our house—hells, the whole stlarnin' village—to the ground!~
@69907 = ~We been workin' our way toward Baldur's Gate. I was wonderin' if ye could tell me how much farther we've got to go?~
@69908 = ~You've a ways yet, I'm afraid. Here's 10 pieces of gold. It'll get you a decent meal and a night's shelter at the encampment down the path.~
@69909 = ~You've a ways yet, I'm afraid. You might be able to find a meal and some shelter at the encampment down the path.~
@69910 = ~A long way. Best you continue your travels now, while you're still able.~
@69911 = ~Ye have our thanks, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Would that we had more to offer ye.~
@69912 = ~You there—yes, you. How would you like to make a little coin? My man needs assistance; if he's not lost half my possessions 'twixt here and the estate, I'll drop dead of shock.~
@69913 = ~I'm afraid your man will have to bear the burden alone, my lord. I have business with Caelar Argent.~
@69914 = ~I've a better way to help your servant. Lighten his burden by leaving all your gold here, and that chest he's carrying too.~
@69915 = ~Still your tongue, fool, or I'll cut it from your mouth.~
@69916 = ~I'm afraid I've no time to spare you.~
@69917 = ~Well, I never...! I try to help someone, and this is the thanks I get. Chalmers! Give this scoundrel a sound thrashing!~
@69918 = ~You want me to fight <PRO_HIMHER>? Uh, no, sir, I shan't be doing that. Farewell, Lord Dushwick. May Tymora look well upon thee—no one else will.~
@69919 = ~Where are you going, Chalmers—Chalmers? CHALMERS!~
@69920 = ~Feh! Begone, then.~
@69921 = ~Hold! There's a toll to pass through here. Give us yer gold or we'll take yer life!~
@69922 = ~Wait a moment, Stumfel. I've seen this <PRO_MANWOMAN> before... I saw <PRO_HIMHER> when I did that job for the Iron Throne... Oh gods—it's <PRO_HIMHER>! The hero of the Gate, Sarevok's slayer!~
@69923 = ~I DON'T WANNA DIE LIKE SAREVOK!~
@69924 = ~Lebass! Get back here, ye wingein' faintheart! Bloody hells. When I catch ye, I'm gonna kick ye in the head till ye're dead!~
@69925 = ~...I'm your commanding officer, Fist Goldbuckler! Get out of that tent!~
@69926 = ~What do you want NOW, Bence?~
@69927 = ~It's Corporal Duncan, Fist. Why aren't you doing drills with the rest of your squad?~
@69928 = ~I've got better things to do.~
@69929 = ~I'm handling this, <CHARNAME>. Be about your business, and stay out of mine.~
@69930 = ~Skie, listen to me, please. I know you don't like the drills, but they're important. When things get bad, the skills you could be learning now could save your life.~
@69931 = ~I think I can manage with the skills I've got—you know, the skills that saved your life from an ornery boar a couple days ago? Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important nap to get back to.~
@69932 = ~Kelemvor take me now, please...~
@69933 = ~Goldbuckler! We aren't finished talking yet!~
@69934 = ~And THAT's what happens when I don't get what I want.~
@69935 = ~<CHARNAME>? What are you doing here? Why didn't you help me fight these beasts?~
@69936 = ~My apologies, Skie. Had I arrived sooner, I certainly would have helped—not that you seemed to need it.~
@69937 = ~Why would I?~
@69938 = ~Why are you here fighting these beasts to begin with?~
@69939 = ~Do not chastise me, girl. I am not some servant at your beck and call.~
@69940 = ~Uh, because I'm the daughter of Grand Duke Entar Silvershield...?~
@69941 = ~Whatever.~
@69942 = ~What are you doing here, anyway?~
@69943 = ~My duty. And you?~
@69944 = ~Never mind that. Aren't you supposed to be back at the camp?~
@69945 = ~Do not question me—do not speak to me at all. Return to the camp, now.~
@69946 = ~I was at the camp. BORING. Then I spotted this clod lurking around Belegarm's supply tent—I think the oaf thought he was being stealthy, if you can believe that. He was trying to poison our rations.~
@69947 = ~I snuck up behind him and gave him the scare of his life. He took off running and there was nobody nearby to stop him, so I went after him. Then I had an idea.~
@69948 = ~It nearly worked too—he had no idea he was being followed. Unfortunately, his friend there knew his business. He spotted me and, well, here we are.~
@69949 = ~You should not have ventured out of the camp alone, Skie. You put yourself in danger.~
@69950 = ~Nice work. Risky, but what's life without risk?~
@69951 = ~Return to the camp, immediately.~
@69952 = ~Fine, I'll go. It's not like anything interesting's happening here now, anyway.~
@69953 = ~And when I get back to Baldur's Gate, what will I say to my father?~
@69954 = ~Ideally, you will tell him you honored his name in serving the Flaming Fist loyally and well.~
@69955 = ~What does your father have to do with anything?~
@69956 = ~Your familial troubles are no concern of mine. Go back to the camp—NOW.~
@69957 = ~You think I honor my family doing drills and digging latrines?~
@69958 = ~I'm the last living child of Entar Silvershield. I'm an adventurer! I should be having adventures!~
@69959 = ~I beg you, do not sacrifice another of Entar's children on the altar of "adventure," Skie. Far more adventurers meet your brother's fate than gain your father's fortune.~
@69960 = ~We don't live in the world that SHOULD be, kid. We're stuck dealing with what IS.~
@69961 = ~You are no adventurer; you are a soldier in service to the Flaming Fist. You made that choice—accept its consequences.~
@69962 = ~Eddard... I didn't even think of him—how my parents felt, not knowing whether he was alive or dead.~
@69963 = ~Daddy wasn't trying to punish me by keeping me on the estate, was he...? He was trying to keep me safe.~
@69964 = ~As a good father should.~
@69965 = ~Your father adventured so you wouldn't have to. Putting yourself in unnecessary danger does him a grave disservice.~
@69966 = ~And you rewarded his devotion by racing headlong towards the nearest trouble you could find.~
@69967 = ~I think... I'm going back to the camp. I need some time to think about this.~
@69968 = ~That's what I wanted. That's why I became a part of this whole stupid expedition, so I could have a little excitement.~
@69969 = ~Military organizations avoid excitement when they can. It would be wise to do the same.~
@69970 = ~This is no game, Skie. You endanger far more than simply yourself by acting in so reckless a fashion.~
@69971 = ~Well, you've had that. Time to go back to the camp.~
@69972 = ~Idiot child! Thank Tymora you are your father's daughter. Were you not a Grand Duke's child, I would show you the back of my hand.~
@69973 = ~Try it and maybe I'll show you a little something, too.~
@69974 = ~Duller than life on my father's estate, and that's saying something.~
@69975 = ~You are acting like a spoiled child, Skie. Don't you realize that in acting so recklessly you endanger more than simply yourself?~
@69976 = ~Well, you've had your fun, and I'm sure Corporal Bence's missing you, so...~
@69977 = ~I've heard enough from you. Begone back to the camp~
@69978 = ~You think these louts were a danger to me? You really don't know what I can do, do you? And here I thought you were just playing along.~
@69979 = ~Playing along...?~
@69980 = ~You are part of something larger than yourself now. There are people on this expedition whose lives depend on you fulfilling your responsibilities as a Flaming Fist.~
@69981 = ~Don't try my patience. You've not earned the arrogance you display.~
@69982 = ~Gods, you're SO BORING! I'm going back to the camp. ~

@69987 = ~Thrix's Wager

A devil has laid claim to my soul.

I took a chance to gain entry to the basalt tower, wagering my soul in a bet with the devil Thrix the Profane. I lost, but Thrix has not taken my soul. He claims he will find me one day to claim his prize. Perhaps then I can beat the devil at his own game.~
@69988 = ~Thrix's Fury

I've angered a devil.

A powerful devil, Thrix the Profane, sought to bar my way. When I challenged him, he fled, leaving a handful of minions to battle for him. The fiend's lackeys fell before me, but the devil promised retribution. I will deal with him should he seek to fulfill his promise. For now, I've more pressing matters to deal with.~

@69995 = ~My soul is already spoken for. This fiend will gain nothing from me, and when he comes for me, I will tear him to pieces. You may share in the bloodshed if you still travel with me.~
@69996 = ~In my time on the surface, I have learned to travel unnoticed. I shall hide myself from this devil for as long as I can. I expect no help from you should it ever find me.~

@69999 = ~I do not know why we could not smite the evil devil creature at once. His is a soul fouler than Minsc's armpits after a three-day march. But if we must wait, we will wait. And when the fiend comes... oh, the buttkicking that shall follow!~

With the exception of your friend Imoen, those who helped you thwart your half-brother's schemes drift away from you, returning to their lives. For the first time since you left Candlekeep, you have the opportunity to reflect on the astonishing turns your life has taken.

Though you are fêted by the rulers of Baldur's Gate, a sense of unease plagues you. You can't help but hear the rumors, the whispers that you share the same dark blood as Sarevok. Some hint you killed your half-brother not for the good of the city, but so you could usurp his place and his power. For the moment, however, your persecutors' voices are drowned out by an ever-growing number of others with more immediate concerns.

Every day, more refugees driven from their homes by the servants of Caelar Argent arrive at the city gates. Many have stories of the Shining Lady's grace; all have tales of her followers' wrath.

A tenday after Korlasz's defeat, you retire to your chamber in the Ducal Palace, your thoughts troubled. You wonder what effect Caelar's crusade will have on Baldur's Gate, little knowing how close at hand the answer is...~ [BD70019]

Thieves broke into a sarcophagus and stole a staff. A spirit now haunts the sarcophagus, looking for its lost staff.

There’s no post-credits easter egg teasing our next game.

But thank you for staying to the end anyway."
@70380 = ~Golden Girdle~
@70381 = ~Though its battered condition speaks to its past use in combat, few of the cuts in this leather girdle were made by an enemy's blade. It would seem the magical symbols gouged into the hide have the practical effect of making the item's wearer less vulnerable to the swords of their foes.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Armor Class: +3 vs. slashing attacks

Weight: 2~
@70382 = ~Girdle of Bluntness~
@70383 = ~Covered in intricate designs sewn into its leather with golden thread, at first glance this girdle seems more decorative than practical. Closer examination is rewarded by the realization that it functions as far more than it appears, bestowing magical protection from hammers, clubs, and other blunt weapons to its wearer.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Armor Class: +4 vs. crushing attacks

Weight: 2~
@70384 = ~Girdle of Piercing~
@70385 = ~Fabricated from crudely cut, unadorned leather, this loin belt was obviously created with utility rather than beauty (or even comfort) in mind. Though not pretty, it is useful, enchanted with warding spells that grant its wearer some magical protection from the slings and arrows of their enemies.

@70399 = ~I recognize the power you wield, lich, and I respect it. But I cannot let you leave this place.~

Saving Throw: None

After years spent with one foot in the world of the living and the other in the lands of the dead, M'Khiin learned that, with intense focus and concentration, she could call upon the spirits of slain kindred to serve her as guardians and protectors. This unique skill allows her to summon a goblin chieftain's ghost (5 HD); six times out of ten she is able to compel two additional goblin warrior spirits (3 HD) to defend her. These guardians will do everything in their power to protect their summoner, but M'Khiin cannot directly control their actions.

The summoning is no simple task for M'Khiin. After using it, she requires rest before she can marshal the mental, physical, and spiritual stamina required to perform the feat again.~
@70403 = ~Killer Mimic~
@70404 = ~Silvershield Guard~
@70405 = ~Greater Feyr~

@70418 = ~You should have saved him! I'll slay you for this!~
@70419 = ~No, my love! I don't want to live without you!~
@70420 = ~Drow Runaways

I can tell Shapur of the fate of the young drow, if I wish.

I found the missing drow teenagers, but chose to slay them rather than let their evil spread. Shapur will undoubtedly be angered by my deed.~
@70421 = ~My poor children... But at least I know they are at peace, and I thank you for that.~ [BD70421]
@70422 = ~He collapsed while crossing Boareskyr Bridge. The symbol of Bhaal, Lord of Murder, seared itself into the stones around him.~ [BD70422]
@70423 = ~She collapsed while crossing Boareskyr Bridge. The symbol of Bhaal, Lord of Murder, seared itself into the stones around her.~ [BD70423]
@70424 = ~Laugh, then, and face Kelemvor with a smile on your lips!~
@70425 = ~Yet insult is not injury, and I believe you did act in ignorance. I shall spare you, but be warned: Do not tamper further with forces beyond your understanding, mortal. Whoever—whatever—you summon next may not be so indulgent as I.~
@70426 = ~Memories of Battles Past

I've learned much by speaking with others in the coalition camp. 

Everyone has their own reason for joining in the struggle against Caelar's crusade. Though they have many different motives for taking up arms against the Shining Lady, all share the same ultimate goal.~
@70427 = ~Memories of Battles Past

I see no reason to continue asking others in camp for their thoughts on war.

Simonetta Twoedged advised me to speak to other members of the coalition force about their experiences in war, but the exercise has proven fruitless, and I see no reason to continue with it.~
@70428 = ~Helvdar's Lucky Charm

Helvdar isn't pleased I'm keeping his lucky boots.

I earned his ire, there can be no doubt, but my personal well-being is a greater priority than his. Even so, the addition of "boot thief" to my supposed crimes will not help my reputation in camp.~
@70429 = ~I need healing. Can you help me with that?~
@70430 = ~Of course. The blessings of Morninglord be upon you, child.~
@70431 = ~That's all the information I need. Let's ask around and try to figure out the traitor's identity.~
@70432 = ~I can't be around Eddy Oddbody anymore. I don't like him, I don't trust him, and that cologne of his makes my eyes water.~
@70433 = ~*summons wolves*~
@70434 = ~Zari~
@70435 = ~A series of interlocking gears and chains connects this machine to a lever built into the floor before it. You have seen similar devices used to open and close doors—usually large ones.~
@70436 = ~Duke Jannath sent you here seeking magical papers or books, did she not? I found these in Korlasz's room.~
@70437 = ~So can we go now?~
@70438 = ~May Caelar's light shine upon you always.~
@70439 = ~To have you craft something useful from a rhino beetle shell, if you're able.~
@70440 = ~Can you make something useful with this rhino beetle shell?~
@70441 = ~Could you do anything with a rhino beetle shell?~
@70442 = ~What can you make of these dragon scales? Anything?~
@70443 = ~We'll see about that soon enough! Cut her down! Let her feel the wrath of the Flaming Fist!~ [BD70443]
@70444 = ~Greetings, <CHARNAME>. If you need any supplies for the road, I can provision you... for a suitable fee, of course.~
@70445 = ~What? A fight? No, no, no. Not at all.~
@70446 = ~I'll leave you to your labors. Farewell.~
@70447 = ~<CHARNAME> does good taking care of <PRO_HISHER> own troubles.~
@70448 = ~The top of the room's marble centerpiece is concave, holding in it a shallow puddle of clear water. Slots along the pedestal's side are apparently designed for scepters of intricate design.~
@70449 = ~If you'll not help us find the Fugue Plane, then join us in our misery! DIE!~
@70450 = ~Journal Pop-Up Messages~
@70451 = ~This setting toggles the journal pop-up messages that appear on top of the screen.~
@70452 = ~You may choose a number of spells to put in your spellbook. These will be the spells that your character currently has knowledge of at the beginning of the game.~
@70453 = ~You've crossed the line, half-orc.~
@70454 = ~What can I do for you?~
@70455 = ~Calm yourself. M'Khiin is with me.~
@70456 = ~Have no fear, smith—the goblin is with me. I'm <CHARNAME>.~
@70457 = ~Combat Autosaves~
@70458 = ~Enable this option to create an autosave whenever a combat encounter occurs.~
@70459 = ~This mural of a dragon in its death throes has faded with age. Flecks of gold are all that remain of the dragon's original color. The gray shades and chalk-white highlights of the exposed underpainting give it a somber, ghostly air.~
@70460 = ~No. But on this side, you die at MY hand. Cut him down! For Grand Duke Silvershield and the Flaming Fist!~ [BD70460]
@70461 = ~As it pleases you, so long as you DO die. Take him! Death to the enemies of Baldur's Gate!~ [BD70461]
@70462 = ~I'll need weapons if I'm to continue.~
@70463 = ~Have you any armor available?~
@70464 = ~Do you have any scrolls or potions for sale?~
@70465 = ~I'd like to see what magical items you have.~
@70466 = ~I can't speak with you right now.~
@70467 = ~I need weapons. What have you got?~
@70468 = ~Magic supplies—potions, scrolls, that sort of thing.~
@70469 = ~Have you any special items for sale? If so, I'd like to take a look at them.~
@70470 = ~Farewell. Enjoy what's left of the <DAYNIGHTALL>.~
@70471 = ~Prepare to meet your heathen gods!~
@70472 = ~Hold! You and the Rashemi share a common foe, Edwin. Can you not work together to see the Shining Lady defeated?~
@70473 = ~Heathen gods are the best kind to meet. Much more fun than the other ones.~
@70474 = ~Know this, mage: To attack Dynaheir is to attack me.~
@70475 = ~Thou wouldst have me stand shoulder to shoulder with this pompous toad? It shall not be.~
@70476 = ~Choose, <CHARNAME>, whose company wouldst thou prefer: mine, a wychlaran of noble Rashemen, or this robed flatulence of a Red Wizard?~
@70477 = ~You are a worthy ally, Dynaheir, but I'll not refuse the aid of any who are willing to fight the Shining Lady.~
@70478 = ~If that's the choice I have, it's no choice at all. Thayan—there is a Flaming Fist encampment not far from here. If you would stand against the Shining Lady, you will be welcomed there.~
@70479 = ~I do not respond well to ultimatums, witch. Begone. Now.~
@70480 = ~So be it. When thy senses return, thou shalt find me with the Flaming Fist.~
@70481 = ~Where Dynaheir goes, so goes Minsc. And you, Thayan... keep your eyes open. Someday, Boo will come for them!~
@70482 = ~Now that that... unpleasantness has been resolved, we can focus upon something of actual import: Caelar Argent.~
@70483 = ~Feel the power of the Red Wizards unleashed!~
@70484 = ~What? You would side with this, this, this WITCH, against the great Odesseiron?~
@70485 = ~Good to know. I'm sure we'll speak again.~
@70486 = ~Surely you jest. You would have me PAY for the "honor" of saving the city yet again?~
@70487 = ~^CYou have rested for 8 hours.^-~
@70488 = ~Dying Myconid~
@70489 = ~Myconid Elder~
@70490 = ~The dragon's head darts from side to side, its eyes never leaving the shadows. "Be mindful of our surroundings, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. The dead are the least of our worries here."~
@70491 = ~After some consideration, the dragon says, "Caelar will be a dangerous adversary. Battling her alone would be unwise—but not so unwise as doing so with allies who cannot be trusted."~
@70492 = ~The dragon's claws tighten on your shoulder. "Caelar's crusade has taken the lands north of the Winding Water. Once we cross it, we are on our own."~
@70493 = ~Your familiar clearly dislikes the idea of using Boareskyr Bridge. "What lies beyond the river worries me less than the crossing of it. This bridge is an ill-starred place."~
@70494 = ~When asked about the crusade, your familiar says simply, "It is too easy to be both righteous and wrong."~
@70495 = ~The dragon returns to your shoulder. Crusader blood rims its mouth. "We can slay countless pawns, but it means nothing if we do not find their queen."~
@70496 = ~The dragon's eyes scan the horizon, searching for Caelar. "Those who live here will not welcome us, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. We must find Caelar—and quickly."~
@70497 = ~Asked for advice, the diminutive dragon reflects for a moment before saying, "Justice will not be denied. This is not over."~
@70498 = ~Your familiar's fur stands on end, and its eyes dart anxiously from side to side. "Do what you must do here," it says. "But please do it quickly."~
@70499 = ~The little animal is torn. It dislikes crowds—"More people to step on me"—but favors finding allies—"More people to feed me scraps."~
@70500 = ~The animal shivers, obviously unnerved. "Long as the enemy's on the other side of the river, I'd rather be on this one."~
@70501 = ~The closer to Winding Water you get, the more anxious your familiar becomes. "Better the bridge than the water, but when it's time to cross, cross quickly, please."~
@70502 = ~Your familiar seems confused. "These crusaders don't seem so bad," it says. When pressed on its reasoning, it eventually admits, "One of 'em fed me."~
@70503 = ~Your familiar has little to offer in the face of the carnage breaking out around you. "Kill them and save me!" it squawks, over and over again.~
@70504 = ~The horrors of Avernus clearly upset your familiar. You can feel its body shivering as it clings to you for protection.~
@70505 = ~Your familiar seems to care less for your plight than its own. "If they kill you, who's going to feed me?"~
@70506 = ~Your foul companion takes in the crypt for several seconds, then, with a sniff, declares, "It's no Iron Throne building, but as hideouts go, you could do worse."~
@70507 = ~"You want as many people around you as possible when you fight someone like Caelar Argent. No, not around, in front of. You want them in front of you. Like shields, you know?"~
@70508 = ~"Advice? What you need advice for? The witch what tried to kill you's in the north; the north is where you gotta go. You aren't safe while she lives."~
@70509 = ~Your familiar chuckles. "Your father died not far from here, boss. Try not to do the same."~
@70510 = ~Your familiar snorts dismissively. "Why waste time learning about Caelar's lackeys? Kill them, kill her, and get back to life in the palace."~
@70511 = ~Your familiar cackles in delight. "Cut the enemy down!" it cries. "Blood and souls! This is what it's all about!"~
@70512 = ~Avernus clearly agitates your familiar. "We're nothing, and nothing will help us. Maybe we're lying; then you better not stay," it mutters in a sing-song voice, swaying back and forth. "But we could be safer, just for one day."~
@70513 = ~Your familiar snorts. "Don't look at me, boss. You got yourself into this mess."~
@70514 = ~Light reflected through a crack in the charred floor catches your attention. A search for the reflected light's source quickly uncovers a loose floorboard.~
@70515 = ~You remove the board, taking care to avoid the numerous burnt and rusty nails protruding from the floor at all angles.~
@70516 = ~Prying the loose floorboard off, you are momentarily distracted by the gleaming object beneath it. In that moment, your hand catches on a rusted nail that leaves a nasty scratch.~
@70517 = ~~
@70518 = ~~
@70519 = ~~
@70520 = ~~
@70521 = ~~
@70522 = ~You wouldn't happen to have any advice, would you?~
@70523 = ~You dare sully the Profane One's glory with this pitiful assault? You must learn your place, little mortal. Come, let Thrix teach you!~
@70524 = ~Heed my words, Thayan—attack Minsc and you will face my wrath.~
@70525 = ~You would have the great Odesseiron stand beside this Rashemi oaf? It shall not be!~
@70526 = ~You're making a mistake, Thayan. We must work together if we're to defeat Caelar.~
@70527 = ~So be it. There's a Flaming Fist encampment not far from here. If you would stand against the Shining Lady, you will be welcomed there.~
@70528 = ~Then begone. Now.~
@70529 = ~Glint Gardnersonson

I should continue looking for Glint's relatives on my travels.

Pritchard Gardnersonson has fallen, proving that in war, the greatest danger does not always come from one's enemy. He may not be the last of Glint's clan to perish in this conflict.~
@70530 = ~Bedding in the castle will be set up for you and other worthies who proved themselves in battle. When you've finished celebrating down here, speak with Sergeant Dazzo—you'll find him on the stairs up to the main floor—He'll take care of you.~
@70531 = ~I can s-still feel the aura from that spellstone draining strength from my limbs. I d-doubt there is much that my people can do to assist you in battle.~
@70532 = ~All I need is some cover from your fellow defenders. Sound the attack, Khalid.~
@70533 = ~Do not question me. I have defeated Sarevok, I can deal with fanatics stationed outside these walls.~
@70534 = ~Perhaps you are right. I'll see what I can do.~
@70535 = ~As you wish, my friend. S-something should also be done about that spellstone. There will be little help we can offer in b-battle, if it continues to drain everyone in fort of strength.~

@70543 = ~Excellent, you have succeeded in luring Caelar outside. Now we take her out, and the crusade will be done with.~
@70544 = ~You're not in command to make assumptions on how we should proceed, <CHARNAME>. These are the peaceful negotiations, protected by the rules of wartime parley, and I suggest you do not compromise the situation.~
@70545 = ~Was the cabal of necromancers I had encountered in ancient ruins underneath Dragonspear also a coincidence?~
@70546 = ~Why do you choose to blame Lady's hand for every misfortune that has befallen you, Bhaalspawn? The Crusade does not dabble in the dark arts of necromancy. Nor does it seek needless bloodshed. All my lady asks of you is to live up to your reputation of the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@70547 = ~I'm sure you would, but the decision is not yours. I'll not sacrifice one of our greatest assets in so casual a fashion.~
@70548 = ~The torsin told me I should escort you to your sleeping area. Just let me know when you're ready to go.~
@70549 = ~All's well, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. If you wish to rest, I can prepare a bed for you.~

@70561 = ~These chests and trunks are all but empty, their contents likely taken by looters amongst your allies' ranks.~

The Flaming Fist expedition to Dragonspear Castle is setting up camp less than a day's travel from Coast Way crossing. Schael Corwin leads the troops, and while I am not beholden to her, it would be wise to seek her counsel on how to proceed.~

@70627 = ~Glint Gardnersonson

I should continue to look for Glint's family.

I found Rhonda, Glint's cousin, working as a seamstress for the crusade. She'd been captured by crusaders and forced to work for their cause.~
@70628 = ~Accessing the Warrens

The way into Dragonspear Castle is within reach.

The guard captain standing watch over the door didn't take liking of me. Once she and her underlings are disposed of, I can enter the Warrens without interference.~
@70629 = ~Accessing the Warrens

I can enter the caverns beneath Dragonspear Castle.

Thanks to Caelar's crest, I was able to bluff my way past the guards without bloodshed. Once inside the belly of beast, I should be extra careful to not provoke any unnecessary fights, lest the entire castle will converge in upon me.~

I should keep looking for the components for Neera's potion.

I gave Neera some turnip juice, one of the ingredients she requires for the potion to rid herself of Adoy's constant presence. Who ever thought THAT would come in handy?~

Originally written by a plane-walking sage, this timeworn volume is part of a much larger work containing studies of various baatezu fiends. Many of the book's pages have been torn out, but those fragments that remain offer some potentially useful information:

"...most baatezu can only be harmed by enchanted weapons..."

"...the most powerful of fiends constantly radiate an aura of fear..."

"...impervious to flame, fiends revel in the use of fire-based magic..."

"...the bite of some fiends is highly poisonous, and may infect the victim with devastating disease..."

"...baatezu enjoy mind games. They often use charm magic to turn their opponents against each other..."

"...powerful fiends possess certain magical abilities they can exercise at will. These include invisibility and teleportation..."

@70989 = ~You'd better change directions or you'll find yourself with no one to lead! Especially not me.~
@70990 = ~I'm through with this. If I ever see you again, I'll greet you with a punch. Keep your distance.~
@70991 = ~Woo woo woo woo!~
@70992 = ~They were weak, but I remain strong.~
@70993 = ~A quiet death.~
@70994 = ~Surprise!~
@70995 = ~Heh heh heh.~
@70996 = ~I'll grant you a quick death.~
@70997 = ~Death from above!~
@70998 = ~I'm in charge now. Keep your head down and we'll make it through the day.~
@70999 = ~Let's find somewhere to hide out. I'm beat.~
@71000 = ~Doing nothing might be safe, but it's boring. Let's find some action.~
@71001 = ~Bleeding out...ugh. Need healing.~

@71004 = ~Over here.~

@71021 = ~It's finally dark. Now I can get things done.~
@71022 = ~Everything I see is mine.~
@71023 = ~Sometimes I think I'm the only one in the world with any common sense.~

@71028 = ~Another successful theft.~
@71029 = ~I've disappeared.~
@71030 = ~Blast! I lost the spell.~
@71031 = ~Set trap, ready to snap.~
@71032 = ~If this keeps up, I'll be rich before long!~
@71033 = ~I don't see how these actions benefit us.~
@71034 = ~You're drawing too much attention. I like to be more... subtle.~
@71035 = ~I'll not wind up in chains on your account. You're on your own.~
@71036 = ~This isn't worth dying for!~
@71037 = ~Better them than me.~
@71038 = ~Destruction comes your way!~
@71039 = ~I've seen enough to know I can best you.~

@71044 = ~My limbs grow heavy, my thoughts leaden. I require rest.~
@71045 = ~The idle mind grows weak. Give me something to do.~
@71046 = ~I presage death if I am not healed!~
@71047 = ~What is needed?~
@71048 = ~I know your secrets.~
@71049 = ~Is it urgent?~
@71050 = ~More desiderata?~
@71051 = ~I have a foreboding.~
@71052 = ~You've disrupted my thoughts.~
@71053 = ~I'll grant you that.~
@71054 = ~Under advisement.~
@71055 = ~That is tolerable.~
@71056 = ~I'll ponder it.~
@71057 = ~True.~

@71088 = ~Nah. Even death couldn't be this boring.~
@71089 = ~Have you seen my hammer?~

@71111 = ~I had a feeling you were going to say that.~
@71112 = ~Heh. I don't think so.~
@71113 = ~A pile of loose boulders with a hidden cache beneath them.~
@71114 = ~(Nothing in the cavern ceiling indicates any weakness you can detect—but if the Stone Dowser can be believed, placing the barrel of Bwoosh! here could have a devastating effect on the Crusade's Dragonspear defenses.)~
@71115 = ~Place the barrel of Bwoosh!~
@71116 = ~Keep the barrel, for now at least.~
@71117 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

The Stone Dowser has found the spot I'm to place the barrel of Bwoosh!

Thanks to the Stone Dowser, I now know where to place the barrel of Bwoosh! to ensure the greatest impact upon the Crusaders gathered in Dragonspear Castle. I've marked the spot on my map, lest I need to return.~
@71118 = ~Stone Snake~
@71119 = ~Hidden Cellar~
@71120 = ~The Call of the Wild Mage

Neera has all she needs to create her potion.

I have delivered all the components Neera needs to create the potion she hopes will finally rid her of the problem of Adoy.~
@71121 = ~Blugglugl, my friend, I have heard your call! Rishthishaa? Where are you? Are you here...? No, no, I can see you are not...~
@71122 = ~Strunk's Elementals

I have slain a wizard in the caverns beneath Dragonspear Castle.

Exploring the underground river caverns, I encountered a mage using powerful magic to subjugate several water elementals. Killing him apparently freed his otherworldly slaves.~
@71123 = ~Proudly emblazoned upon this banner is Baldur's Gate's coat of arms, a mighty ship with blue skies above and darker waters below.~
@71124 = ~Aye, I'm free, I feel the Fugue drawing me to it, but—Halatathlaer... My old friend. I am free but she is not. Find her spirit, I beg you. Release her as you have me.~
@71125 = ~I met the man's ghost in his castle. I'm sure you two will meet again ere long.~
@71126 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I should speak with Torsin de Lancie.

Dragonspear Castle's inner courtyard has been penetrated by the forces aligned against the crusade. I would do well to consult a coalition commander about our troops' progress before entering the castle itself.~
@71127 = ~The Stone Dowser amulet spins back and forth, seeking faults in the earth. It will likely provide more definitive directions when you near your goal.~
@71128 = ~Listen, you've got to help me. PLEASE. Adoy's in my head and he's driving me mad! I need the ingredients for a potion to get rid of him. I've got dead water from under Boareskyr Bridge, now I just need the leg of a seven-legged spider.~
@71129 = ~Coldhearth? No. There was a giant in the next cavern over from here. It was no match for me.~
@71130 = ~Coldhearth? No. There was a giant in yonder cavern, but it fell to the undead.~
@71131 = ~What's this ye tell me now? Semahl's dead? Ye witless, fair unbearded ninny, that giant ye killt was one o' ours!~
@71132 = ~Semahl has fallen, then? Ach! He deserved better, the poor, thick-headed numpty.~
@71133 = ~Awright, awright, just—just pull yerself t'gether, Auchlin. Semahl's dead, there's naught tae be done about it now... <CHARNAME>, tell me, have ye seen any sign of Gurn Coldhearth?~
@71134 = ~Glint Gardnersonson

Pritchard Gardnersonson, a relative of Glint's, is in the camp. I should seek him out.

Apparently one of Glint Gardernsonson's cousins, Pritchard, is in the coalition camp. It would be best for everyone if I sought him out sooner than later.~
@71135 = ~The Problem with Pritchard

I should seek out the gnome Pritchard Gardnersonson.

A pair of militiamen from Daggerford seem to be having difficulty with their commanding officer, Pitchard Gardnersonson. For the sake of all who oppose Caelar, it would be best if I resolved this situation, one way or another.~
@71136 = ~Glint Gardnersonson

I should speak with Glint about what to do with his cousin, Pritchard Gardnersonson.

I've located Pritchard Gardnersonson—but what should be done with him? Perhaps his cousin, Glint, will be able to help me decide.~
@71137 = ~The Problem with Pritchard

Pritchard Gardnersonson will no longer interfere with the effort to thwart Caelar.

Tymora smiles upon the forces besieging Dragonspear Castle. Any issues Pritchard Gardnersonson's continued involvement in the coalition against the Shining Lady could cause have been nipped in the bud.~
@71138 = ~Glint Gardnersonson

I should speak with Glint about what to do with his cousin, Pritchard Gardnersonson.

I've located Pritchard Gardnersonson—but what should be done with him? Perhaps his cousin, Glint, will be able to help me decide.~
@71139 = ~The Problem with Pritchard

General Stonehand has decided to intervene in the matter of Pritchard Gardnersonson.

I told Pritchard Gardnersonson how those under his command truly feel about him. General Stonehand of the Daggerford militia has decided to deal with the matter personally.~
@71140 = ~The Problem with Pritchard

The Daggerford soldiers Pritchard angered should be told what happened to him.

Pritchard Gardnersonson will no longer be a thorn in the side of those who served under him. I should let the militiamen who told me of him know the situation has been resolved.~
@71141 = ~Glint Gardnersonson

I should be vigilant watching for members of the Family Gardnersonson.

Glint's family is spread out all across the Sword Coast. I should keep my eyes open for any more of them that might cross my path.~
@71142 = ~The Problem with Pritchard

I have informed Pritchard Gardnersonson's disgruntled subordinates he will no longer bother them.

The Daggerford militiamen who had such issues with Pritchard Gardnersonson were pleased to learn they will no longer have to deal with the man. They happily handed over a number of potions as thanks for ridding them of their problem.~
@71143 = ~The Problem with Pritchard~
@71144 = ~Be fearless, and Tempus shall look upon you with favor! ~
@71145 = ~What's a cleric of Tempus doing here? ~
@71146 = ~Praise him indeed. ~
@71147 = ~Why praise a god of pointless slaughter? ~
@71148 = ~Well met! ~
@71149 = ~Steeling soldiers for the coming battle. Savoring the anticipation of certain glory. Waiting for the call of my Lord. ~
@71150 = ~Healing those who have achieved glory in their righteous victory. Tempus is well pleased, and offers succor to those who have fought honorably. ~
@71151 = ~Tempus has no desire for slaughter. When combat is necessary, as it often is, He asks only that we fight honorably and without fear. ~
@71152 = ~When your enemy has been defeated, however, you give them quarter. This is the path to righteousness, my friend. ~
@71153 = ~You have the look of one who has known many battles, yet you are clearly no soldier. What would you have of me? ~
@71154 = ~What services do you offer? ~
@71155 = ~Nothing, actually. I'll be on my way. ~
@71156 = ~What is there to tell? Be fearless. Do not run from the fight. Obey the rules of war. These are His commandments. ~
@71157 = ~Is that why you follow him? ~
@71158 = ~"Do not run from the fight?" So never retreat? ~
@71159 = ~What are the 'rules of war'? ~
@71160 = ~So you fear nothing? ~
@71161 = ~I have no more questions. ~
@71162 = ~We all respond to the call in our own way, do we not? ~
@71163 = ~Mine came to me early in life. I loved the thrill of battle, the excitement running through my veins as I faced my enemy. ~
@71164 = ~My family thought I was destined to be a soldier. Tempus showed me otherwise. It was not the first time I discovered my path was not what everyone believed it should be. ~
@71165 = ~"Do not run from the fight?" So never retreat? ~
@71166 = ~What are the 'rules of war'? ~
@71167 = ~So you fear nothing? ~
@71168 = ~I have no more questions. ~
@71169 = ~One does not wage war recklessly. Retreat when you must, but do not avoid the battle when it rears before you. Win, and win decisively. ~
@71170 = ~So why do YOU follow Tempus? ~
@71171 = ~What are the 'rules of war'? ~
@71172 = ~So you fear nothing? ~
@71173 = ~I have no more questions. ~
@71174 = ~Do not resort to craven tricks or dishonorable tactics. You must respect all with the potential for valor, even the foe whose life you must take. ~
@71175 = ~Do this and Tempus will look upon you with favor, for you will have defended your hearth and still may hold your head high. ~
@71176 = ~So why do YOU follow Tempus? ~
@71177 = ~"Do not run from the fight?" So never retreat? ~
@71178 = ~So you fear nothing? ~
@71179 = ~I have no more questions. ~
@71180 = ~What should I fear? War? ~
@71181 = ~War is a natural force, the storm that civilization brings by its very existence. I shall laugh at its thunder and ride its winds for as long as I am able. ~
@71182 = ~One day I shall die, and I will go to my god gladly, knowing I served Him well. There is nothing to fear in such a life. ~
@71183 = ~So why do YOU follow Tempus? ~
@71184 = ~"Do not run from the fight?" So never retreat? ~
@71185 = ~So you fear nothing? ~
@71186 = ~I have no more questions. ~
@71187 = ~Then I trust you shall take your leave. ~
@71188 = ~I believe I've found your amulet. ~
@71189 = ~When I brought back your amulet, you mentioned something about acceptance. What did that mean? ~
@71190 = ~What services do you offer? ~
@71191 = ~I shall. Another time. ~
@71192 = ~Wait! I... have a boon I must ask of you. ~
@71193 = ~During our march here, we encountered Crusaders on the eastern edge of the forest. During the battle, I dropped an amulet. ~
@71194 = ~We were forced into retreat, and I haven't been able to return since. If you come across the amulet on your travels, I would appreciate its return. It is worth a great deal to me. ~
@71195 = ~An amulet? Like this one? ~
@71196 = ~Why not look for it yourself? ~
@71197 = ~Is the amulet magical? ~
@71198 = ~I'll keep an eye out. What does it look like? ~
@71199 = ~Worth how much, exactly? ~
@71200 = ~I have more important things to do. ~
@71201 = ~The Lord of Battles demands I remain with the soldiers to heal and prepare them. I cannot spare time for a mission of consequence only to myself. ~

@71215 = ~Why not look for it yourself? ~
@71216 = ~Is the amulet magical? ~
@71217 = ~I'll keep an eye out. What does it look like? ~
@71218 = ~Your friendship is worth nothing to me. ~
@71219 = ~It is wooden, hand-carved and emblazoned with the symbol of Tempus. I doubt you will see another like it, as my mother made it prior to my entering the priesthood. ~
@71220 = ~I suspect it's lost forever, but... we shall see. There is yet hope.~
@71221 = ~Very well. If it cannot be, then it cannot be. ~
@71222 = ~That's it! You found it! ~
@71223 = ~I can't tell you how much this amulet means to me. It's a symbol of my family's acceptance, something I will treasure forever. ~
@71224 = ~Their acceptance? Of your faith? ~
@71225 = ~Me, I'll treasure the reward. ~
@71226 = ~I'm glad I could find it for you. ~
@71227 = ~The initials on the back of the amulet... one is the name I held when I was born and the other is the name I hold now. My mother carved them both.~
@71228 = ~You see, this amulet marks the first time my parents called me Mizhena, accepting that is who I am. I cannot believe I was careless enough to lose it. ~
@71229 = ~You changed your name? ~
@71230 = ~I don't need to hear more. ~
@71231 = ~I did. It turned out that my birth name was unsuitable. ~
@71232 = ~It was not something others will often understand, but this... this told me it was possible. Thank you for returning it.~

@71241 = ~Thankfully it does not need to. Here is the reward for returning the amulet, as promised. Thank you again. ~

@71244 = ~This makes no sense. ~
@71245 = ~There are far stranger things in this world, I suppose. ~

@71251 = ~Truer words are rarely spoken. Here is the reward for returning the amulet, as promised. Thank you again. ~
@71252 = ~Perhaps, but the service you have done me today exceeds such small trespasses. You are forgiven. ~
@71253 = ~Torn earth and bloodstains show that a battle took place here recently. A trail leads north from the battle site, as if a large animal dragged off some of the corpses.~
@71254 = ~These marks have the look of a lion, but lions are not so large nor are they common in this area. We should be cautious. ~
@71255 = ~I don't like the look of those tracks. Looks like they're from a big cat, but bigger than I've ever seen. Let's go. ~
@71256 = ~Big claw marks. Big cat. Dangerous. ~

@71269 = ~I am not the one in need. It is my father, in fact. ~

@71277 = ~I've found him already. Your father is alive and sends a message: he is proud of you and hopes to see you again soon.~
@71278 = ~That is a great relief. May the Lord of Battles bless you, Hero.~
@71279 = ~I know this all too well. I would learn the truth, one way or another. Go with Tempus's blessing, Hero.~

@71287 = ~He is... dead. Ah.~

@71290 = ~He lives? Is it truly so? ~
@71291 = ~I offer my gratitude to the Foehammer. You play no favorites, yet I am thankful you have not exacted your price from me today. ~
@71292 = ~And I also offer every gratitude to you, Hero. Take this, with the blessings of the Lord of Battles himself. I will never forget your kindness.~
@71293 = ~You... would not lie to me, I hope.~
@71294 = ~No. Those were his exact words. He wants to trade war stories over ale.~
@71295 = ~Then I am at a loss for words. Some battles... they are harder than others, Hero. I know you understand this.~
@71296 = ~You are... the Hero of Baldur's Gate, are you not? You have our thanks. The Crusade does not treat its prisoners kindly, and we would not have lasted much longer. ~
@71297 = ~Glad to help. ~
@71298 = ~Off you go, then. The Coalition can keep you safe. ~
@71299 = ~They had loot. It works out for everyone. ~
@71300 = ~Did you arrive with the Coalition? Tell me, do you know what became of a cleric of Tempus who marches with them? H-her name is... Mizhena. ~
@71301 = ~Are you Mizhena's father? ~
@71302 = ~She died during the battle. ~
@71303 = ~I've no idea who that is. ~
@71304 = ~She's still with the Coalition, last I saw her. ~
@71305 = ~I am. How is it that you know of me? ~
@71306 = ~Mizhena asked me to look for you. ~
@71307 = ~She would do that. She has always fussed over me, since her mother died, as if I have not been a soldier my entire life. ~
@71308 = ~It is good to know she still cares. It... has not always been easy between us, but I try.~
@71309 = ~If you would be so kind, tell her I am well. Tell her I am... proud of all she has achieved, and hope to see her again soon. We shall trade stories of the war over ale. ~
@71310 = ~Farewell, Hero, and Tempus watch over you. ~
@71311 = ~Then my daughter yet lives. Tempus is... unexpectedly merciful today. ~
@71312 = ~Ah. Tempus exacts his due, as always. ~

I told Mizhena her father had died.

@71330 = ~Blazing Glory +3~
@71331 = ~This glittering morningstar was crafted by weaponsmiths in the Temple of Tempus in Waterdeep. Fashioned as a weapon for Tempus's priests, who cannot use their deity's favored weapon due to its bladed edge, Blazing Glory has a black iron tip studded with points of alternating gold and ruby. Enchantments harden these points and add a flash of fire with every blow. The wielder of Blazing Glory never tires in battle, fortified by the will of the Lord of Battles himself.

@71335 = ~Get away from those prisoners!~
@71336 = ~Drow Runaways

I've slain a band of drow I encountered.

In the caverns beneath Dragonspear a band of drow crossed paths with the crusade—and me. It seems likely they sought the two drow I encountered down here earlier. Perhaps some more of their kind will now be sent to look for them...~
@71337 = ~Urold~
@71338 = ~Is this your amulet?~
@71339 = ~My amulet!~

- Plutarch~
@71345 = ~Only weeks ago, the malevolent Sarevok brought the city of Baldur's Gate to the edge of destruction.~
@71346 = ~His god-tainted blood drove him towards a dark destiny—a destiny you may ultimately fulfill.~
@71347 = ~You, like him, are a child of Bhaal, the dead god of murder. Bhaal foresaw his own death and sired mortal children in an effort to bring about his return. Sarevok intended to become the new Lord of Murder.~
@71348 = ~You put an end to Sarevok's plans and slew your half-brother. With his passing, you became known as the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@71349 = ~Since then, Grand Duke Belt's hospitality has seen you and your oldest friend, Imoen, living in unfamiliar, but not unpleasant, comfort and luxury.~
@71350 = ~Now a new threat casts a shadow over the city. A massive army on a holy crusade has thrown the Sword Coast into turmoil.~
@71351 = ~From its base in the ruins of the infamous Dragonspear Castle, this force has rolled forth from the High Moor in all directions. Mercenaries, veterans, and common folk have rallied to the crusade's banner.~
@71352 = ~Thousands have been killed, and tens of thousands displaced as the crusaders seize the lands north of Baldur's Gate. Refugees have flooded the city, and the Flaming Fist cannot hope to maintain order for long.~
@71353 = ~Little is known of the crusade's leader, the charismatic warrior Caelar Argent. Those who follow her revere her as the Shining Lady, but her background and goals are shrouded in mystery.~
@71354 = ~Some say she is divine, a hero sent by the gods to crush evil no matter the cost. Others whisper that she is another spawn of Bhaal, intent on following the same path as Sarevok.~
@71355 = ~One thing above all else is clear: If the Sword Coast is to find any measure of peace, Caelar Argent must be stopped.~
@71356 = ~Talk to me later. We are in battle...~
@71357 = ~Thank you, I had thought this lost forever! However, I have little time to talk, there is a matter of urgency. I don't suppose I could ask your help?~

@71366 = ~The Gods are often fickle, but sometimes that works out for the best for us. Farewell.~
@71367 = ~Mercy is for the weak. Tempus cannot be pleased with you being caged by this rabble. You will find no mercy at my hand.~
@71368 = ~I have been caged and disarmed but I will not turn away from battle! TEMPUS!~
@71369 = ~The portal is open! Everybody run, as fast as you can! There is no much time before the creatures of fire set the barrels ablaze!~
@71370 = ~The Siege of Dragonspear

I must prevent the barrels from taking any damage.

The crusader wizard has succeeded in opening a temporary portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire, spewing forth flames and its denizens into material plane. With intense heat emanating nearby it would take but a slightest scratch to the barrels to ignite their contents and engulf the whole area in raging inferno.~
@71371 = ~Mizhena's Amulet

I've returned Mizhena's lost amulet.

Mizhena, a priest of Tempus, lost an amulet in a battle with crusaders. The amulet had a great deal of sentimental value to her, and I managed to locate it in the woods near the coalition camp.
